[REPLY OF COMMODORE R. F. STOCKTON TO THE LETTER FROM CITIZENS OF TOM's RIVER.]
</p><p>
To Messrs. F. J. Speer, W. I. James, James Grulick, Benjamin L. Irons, and others, citizens of the county of Ocean. 
</p><p>
GENTLEMEN: In consequence of my absence from Princeton, I did not see your letter until it was published in the Monmouth Democrat. 
</p><p>
It would, nevertheless, have been sooner acknowledged had not numerous engagements prevented. The act to which you refer, I assure you, gave me no annoyance. If in the exercise of the 
largest liberty any of my fellow-citizens see fit to recreate them selves by executing effigies which they please to designate  Commodore Stockton, they are welcome to all the enjoyment and glory 
they can derive from amusements so harmless. While conscious of the rectitude of my own actions and intentions, malicious denunciations move me not. 
</p><p>
It is now nearly a quarter of a century since I devoted my mind, my means, and those of co-operating friends whom I could influence, to the cause of internal improvement in New Jersey. When I consider the inadequacy of my experience and abilities to the vast 
enterprise in which I then engaged, the difficulties to be encountered, and the slender resources which at first were within my control, and then advert to the realization of my proudest hopes, and 
more especially when I survey the benefits which, in part through 
my instrumentality, have been conferred upon New Jersey by this 
system of internal improvements, which I have advocated and defended, I can well tolerate with indifference any abuse which my 
success and my fidelity to the true interests and welfare of my 
native State may provoke. 
</p><p>
Gentlemen, you say that a majority of the people here are 
opposed to the measures of the party with which you co-operate, 
and to the State policy of which you are an able advocate. With 
regard to party measures, I do not care a rush; but in relation 
to the improvement of New Jersey I do feel deeply concerned, and 
will hope that the time is not far distant when there will be little 
or no difference of opinion between us. No doubt the time has 
been, when a formidable opposition existed in New Jersey to the 
system of internal improvements with which I have been identified. 
The papers teemed with abuse of me, and a powerful party threatened the extinction of private rights and the violation of public honour. I placed myself in the breach on those occasions ; but I 
never deprecated abuse, nor retorted the intemperate fulminations 
of political adversaries. I chose rather to let results speak for mo. 
To their verdict I always confidently appeal. I was willing to 
stand or fall with the success or failure of the system which I recommended. Now that these results have proved eminently fortunate now that triumphant success vindicates my system, though I 
may continue to treat defamation with silence and calumny with 
contempt, I shall on no fitting occasion like the present fail to remind my fellow-citizens that they owe the present prosperity of 
New Jersey, under God, first, to the system of internal improvement now subsisting, and, second, to the adherence by the State 
and the joint companies to the principles of plighted good faith and honour. 
</p><p>
Interposing between the two great commercial emporiums of the 
continent the natural bridge for all internal intercourse between 
the North and the South, her commerce absorbed and diverted from 
her own harbours, New Jersey was bound by every dictate of political sagacity to make the most of her territorial advantages, and 
to compensate herself therefrom for the injuries inflicted by the 
overshadowing rivalship of New York and Philadelphia. The first 
great desideratum for the accomplishment of this object was the 
construction of the Delaware and Raritan Canal. The success of 
the Hudson and Erie Canal inspired many with a desire that New 
Jersey should make the Delaware and Raritan Canal a State work. 
</p><p>
The State wisely (as events have shown) shrunk from the danger 
of encumbering herself with debt. She was not possessed of the 
vast resources of New York, and, judging from the analogy furnished by State prosecution and management of public works else 
where, it is quite probable that, had this State commenced the 
construction of the Delaware and Raritan Canal, she would 
have abandoned it before its completion, and, instead of pouring 
its contributions (as at present) into her treasury, the debt incurred for its commencement would hang like an incubus on her prosperity. 
</p><p>
For more than ten years subsequent to the completion of the 
canal, the receipts of the joint companies for toll hardly paid its 
expenses. How would the State have sustained herself under such 
a result, even if she had completed the construction of the canal ? 
She would probably have been compelled by public clamour to have 
sacrificed it to speculators, who would assume only half of her indebtedness, just as Pennsylvania is now endeavouring to dispose of 
her public works. The State of New Jersey pursued a more cautious policy; she conferred a liberal charter on a company for the 
construction of the canal. The company which have completed it were secured against ruinous competition, and have been thereby 
enabled patiently to await the growth of business on that great work. 
</p><p>
Contemporaneous with the incorporation of the Canal Company, 
the State incorporated also the Camden and Amboy Railroad and 
Transportation Company. At that time the nature and uses of 
railroads were but little known or understood, and no one was aware 
of the mighty capacity of the steam locomotive. I foresaw that 
the Delaware and Raritan Canal could not be constructed while 
menaced with the rivalship of a railroad. The public men of New 
Jersey and the people soon became impressed with the same views ; 
they saw in competition none of those benign influences which its 
over-zealous friends attribute to it. They were not willing to risk 
the defeat of the canal for the sake of encouraging a ruinous com 
petition, principally for the benefit of the inhabitants of other States. They established, then, after careful deliberation, the 
policy and the system which have continued to this day, a system 
which, whether called a monopoly or any thing else, has vindicated 
itself. That system insured the construction of the Delaware and Raritan Canal; it insured also two other railroad thoroughfares 
across the State ; adequate accommodations, at reasonable fares, for 
the transit of all freight and passengers over the State ; it insured, 
too, just compensation to the State for the privileges conferred, 
yielding an abundant and increasing revenue, and, in the progress 
of time and the development of the system, it secured likewise the 
construction of all local roads which may be needed in the southern 
and western parts of the State, when, without it, they would hardly 
be made in the lifetime of the present generation. And lastly, that 
system, after all doubt about the productiveness of the canal and 
railroads shall have been dispelled, and after experience shall have 
demonstrated the most judicious and economical method of managing them, invests the State with the right to take them at their 
appraised value. Should she do so at the time when by law she is 
authorized to exercise her option so to do, and should she conduct 
them wisely and economically, there can be no doubt they will 
make New Jersey, in proportion to her population, the most opulent 
and flourishing State in America or elsewhere. 
</p><p>
Now, in contrast with the results of this system of New Jersey, 
cast your eyes over our sister States, where State construction and 
management of public works, and boundless competition, have prevailed. In one case you perceive powerful States crippled with 
debt and tormented with vexatious taxation, oppressing industry and depreciating the value of the property of the people. In the 
other case you see gigantic corporations tottering on the verge of bankruptcy, and threatening, in their fall, to cover the land with 
desolation, impoverishing widows and orphans the rich and those who are not rich. 
</p><p>
Unrestricted competition, when applied to railroad constructions, 
is an enormous and delusive fraud ; it is a fraud because it promises 
advantages which it cannot confer ; . it allures into a snare the 
unwary, the ignorant, and the helpless, and involves them all in 
one fatal catastrophe. 
</p><p>
It is far better for the public to have one good railroad than two 
inferior railroads. The real interests of the people of the whole 
country are not promoted by railroads transporting freight and 
passengers at a loss. The interest of no class can be permanently promoted by the industry of any other class being underpaid. 
Unrestricted competition in the construction of railroads, by producing inadequate compensation for railroad services, has a tendency 
to destroy capital. The destruction of capital is a calamity to the 
whole community. It checks enterprise and deprives labour of 
employment. There is another reason why such unrestricted com 
petition is a fraud. It eventually places the weaker competitor in 
the power of the stronger, making the rich richer, and the powerful more powerful, and finally terminates in a more inexorable and 
omnipotent monopoly than otherwise could be possible. 
</p><p>
When, under the sanction of legislative enactment, a large capital 
is invested in such a work as a great railroad or canal, the objects 
of which are the promotion of the public interests as well as those 
of individuals, when that capital is unalterably fixed, and converted 
into such a public improvement, and in the shape of stock-shares 
diffused throughout the community in the hands of men of limited 
means, held in part by the comparatively poor by widows and 
orphans by executors and administrators eleemosynary institutions, it ought to be considered as under the aegis of the public protection. 
</p><p>
Were an incendiary to fire the shop and stations of such a rail 
road company, to tear up its rails, destroy its bridges, or in any 
way wantonly injure its structures, he would be deemed worthy of 
condign punishment, and the condemnation of all men would make 
him infamous. Yet, under the plausible pretext of competition, 
still more destructive and pernicious injuries are inflicted upon the 
enterprising capitalist and his helpless and confiding friends, who 
may have embarked their whole worldly substance in a railroad or 
a canal. 
</p><p>
I care not what circumstances furnish the occasion for such unrighteous legislation ; when such wrongs are perpetrated, they are 
equivalent to robbery; they have no foundation in justice; they 
are exertions of despotic power, irrespective of the principles of honour or justice. It is impossible for the interests of any community to be advanced by the violation of the eternal principles of justice. 
</p><p>
These conclusions are established by experience, as exhibited in 
the consequences of unrestricted railroad competition in New England, in New York, and in Great Britain. New Jersey has wisely 
repudiated the fraud and folly of a reckless and destructive competition. And the public enjoys the benefit of her wisdom and 
prudence, in the most ample accommodations, upon fair terms, of 
the facilities offered by her public works. The proprietors of these 
works, controlled by no sordid or circumscribed view of their duties 
and obligations, strong in the confidence of the people, and grateful for the good faith and support which have always been manifested 
towards them by the State and their fellow-citizens, feel an abiding 
disposition to comply with all the just requisitions of an enlightened 
public, and will ultimately be able, from the abundance of their 
resources and their strength, to transport both passengers and 
freight at lower rates than any ill-judged competition could ever 
have compelled. 
</p><p>
Next in importance to the adoption of the present system of 
internal improvement in New Jersey, in estimating the causes of 
her prosperity, may be ranked the firmness and consistency with 
which the joint companies and the State have adhered, through all 
the phases of monetary and political affairs, to the principles of honour and plighted faith. 
</p><p>
There has been no time within the last twenty years when the 
joint companies, by the simple relinquishment of all opposition to 
efforts for the establishment of competing railroads, could not have 
rid themselves of all contributions to the State Treasury, and vastly 
augmented their profits and income, while at the same time they 
could have defeated any actual competition. They have, however, 
turned a deaf ear to all overtures contemplating such results, even 
when the madness of party seemed to create a necessity for such 
action. They have stood at the portals of the State Treasury, its 
protector and defender, when others have sought the destruction of 
the State revenue and credit. I do not exaggerate when I say that 
it has always been considered by the joint companies a paramount 
obligation to consult the interest of the State. 
</p><p>
And now, after having devoted the best portion of my life to the 
promotion of the interests, the happiness, and prosperity of New 
Jersey, after having been so long in contact with her public men, 
her legislators, and her most intelligent citizens in all parts of the 
State, if there be a man whom I have deceived or misled, whose 
confidence I have abused, or who can justly charge me with any 
violation of the strictest principles of honour and integrity in my 
intercourse with him, I am yet to know him. 
</p><p>
It is because my fellow-citizens know that I have been thus 
governed by the severest principles of honour that they have stood 
by me to baffle and defeat those who, no matter under what pretence or profession, sought to endanger the State revenue. Demagogues 
have in vain attempted, by all the acts of political chicanery, to 
corrupt their principles or excite their cupidity. There never has 
been a year or a day, in spite of all the lavish expenditure of foreign 
adventurers or the marshalled array of faction, when any man 
could stand up in the Legislature of New Jersey and propose the 
violation of the State's compact with the joint companies, without 
incurring the doom of universal execration and contempt. 
</p><p>
Vindictively as I have been assailed for my connection with these 
companies, identical as their prostration has been sought to be 
made with the triumph first of one party and then of another, 
ingeniously as astute lawyers and politicians have proved the in 
fraction of the public faith to be compatible with law and justice, 
there has been no time when any of these attacks, or propositions, 
or sophisms, have made any serious impression on the public mind. 
That public mind has been too honest and too sagacious to cherish 
error, or to be led, even by its passions or its prejudices, to the com 
mission of injustice. 
</p><p>
There is no State in the Union there is, in my opinion, no State 
in the world in which public faith and the rights and property of 
men are more secure than in New Jersey. There is no State in 
which stronger temptations have been offered to violate the sanctity 
of State obligations than here ; but there is no State in which such 
temptations have been more contemptuously spurned or more 
universally despised. To live in such a State, to be citizens of such 
a commonwealth, is a great satisfaction. To die in such a community, with the consoling reflection that our children will enjoy 
the shelter of its protection and all the benefits of its just laws 
and free and noble institutions, divests even death itself, in some 
measure, of apprehension. In the natural course of human life, 
there are but a few more years allotted to me. I am withdrawn 
from public life, and never expect or desire to reappear on its surface. My chief desire and solicitude with respect to public affairs 
are concentrated in New Jersey. My chief ambition is to be remembered as one of her sons, who honestly and assiduously devoted 
himself to her welfare. There is a monitor within my breast which 
assures me that, whatever may be the views of any of my fellow-citizens in relation to me now, however harsh their judgment, how 
ever unrelenting and unforgiving their enmity and hostile their 
attitude, the time will come, when, after my poor remains shall 
repose beneath the sods of New Jersey with those of my ancestors, that my memory will be cherished with respect, and that my name 
will stand on the page of New Jersey's history, associated forever with those whose chief ambition was the promotion of her prosperity, happiness, and glory. 
</p><p>
Gentlemen, I thank you for the letter which you have addressed to me. I will long remember it as a flattering evidence of true 
regard from my fellow-citizens at Tom's River. 
</p><p>
Very faithfully, 
</p><p>
Your friend and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
R. F. STOCKTON.

UNITED STATES SHIP PRINCETON, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
SIR : The United States ship Princeton having received her armament on board, and being nearly ready for sea, I have the honour to transmit to you the following account of her equipment, &c. 
</p><p>
The Princeton is a full-rigged ship, of great speed and power, able to perform any service that can be expected from a ship-of-war. 
Constructed upon the most approved principles of naval architecture, she is believed to be at least equal to any ship of her class, 
with her sails. She has an auxiliary power of steam, and can make greater speed than any sea-going steamer or other vessel heretofore 
built. Her engines lie snug in the bottom of the vessel, out of reach of an enemy's shot, and do not at all interfere with the use of the sails, but can at any time be made auxiliary thereto. She 
shows no chimney and makes no smoke, and there is nothing in her external appearance to indicate that she is propelled by steam. 
</p><p>
The advantages of the Princeton over both sailing-ships and steamers propelled in the usual way are great and obvious. She can go in and out of port at pleasure, without regard to the force 
or direction of the wind or tide, or the thickness of the ice. She can ride safely with her anchors in the most open roadstead, and may lie to in the severest gale of wind with safety. She can not 
only save herself, but will be able to tow a squadron from the dangers of a lee-shore. Using ordinarily the power of the wind, and 
reserving her fuel for emergencies, she can remain at sea the same length of time as other sailing-ships. Making no noise, smoke, or agitation of the water, (and, if she chooses, showing no sail,) she 
can surprise an enemy. She can at pleasure take her own position and her own distance from the enemy. Her engines and waterwheel being below the surface of the water, safe from an enemy's shot, she is in no danger of being disabled, even if her masts should be destroyed. She will not be at a daily expense for fuel, as other steamships are. The engines, being seldom used, will probably out 
last two such ships. These advantages make the Princeton, in my opinion, the cheapest, fastest, and most certain ship-of-war in the 
world. The equipments of this ship are of the plainest and most substantial kind, the furniture of the cabins being made of white 
pine boards, painted white, with mahogany chairs, table, and side board, and an American-manufactured oil-cloth on the floor. To economize room, and that the ship may be better ventilated, curtains 
of American-manufactured linen are substituted for the usual and more cumbrous and expensive wooden bulkheads, by which arrangement the apartments of the men and officers may in an instant be 
thrown into one, and a degree of spaciousness and comfort is attained unusual in a ship of her class. The Princeton is armed with 
two long 225-pound wrought-iron guns and twelve 42-pound carronades, all of which may be used at once on either side of the ship. She can consequently throw a greater weight of metal at one broad 
side than most frigates. The big guns of the Princeton can be fired! with an effect terrific and almost incredible, and with a certainty heretofore unknown. The extraordinary effects of the shot were 
proved by firing at a target, which was made to represent a section of the two sides and deck of a seventy-four-gun ship, and timbered, kneed, planked, and bolted, in the same manner. This target was 
five hundred and sixty yards from the gun. With the smaller charges of powder the shot passed through these immense masses of timber, (being fifty-seven inches thick,) tearing it away and 
splintering it for several feet on each side, and covering the whole surface of the ground for a hundred yards square with fragments of wood and iron. The accuracy with which these guns throw their 
immense shot (which are three feet in circumference) may be judged by this : that six shot fired in succession at the same elevation struck the same horizontal plank in a target more than half a mile 
distant. By the application of the various arts to the purposes of war on board the Princeton, it is believed that the art of gunnery for sea-service has, for the first time, been reduced to something 
like mathematical certainty. The distance to which these guns can throw their shot, at every necessary angle of elevation, has been ascertained by a series of careful experiments. The distance from 
the ship to any object is readily ascertained with an instrument on 
board, contrived for that purpose, by an observation which it requires but an instant to make, and by inspection without calculation. By self-acting locks, the guns can be fired accurately at the 
necessary elevation, no matter what the motion of the ship may be. It is confidently believed that this small ship will be able to battle 
with any vessel, however large, if she is not invincible against any foe. The improvements in the art of war adopted on board the Princeton, may be productive of more important results than any thing that has occurred since the invention of gunpowder. The numerical force of other navies, so long boasted, may be set at naught. The ocean may again become neutral ground, and the 
rights of the smallest as well as the greatest nations may once more be respected. 
</p><p>
All of which, for the honour and defence of every inch of our territory, is most respectfully submitted to the honourable Secretary of the Navy, for the information of the President and Congress of the United States, 
</p><p>
By your obedient and faithful servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
SiR, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th, ordering me to proceed in the Congress to the 
Sandwich Islands, &c. &c. ; and also the sealed orders which I am not to open till I am beyond the capes of Virginia. 
</p><p>
The following expression in your letter of the 17th So soon as the United States frigate of which you have volunteered to take command, in connection with the sealed package, has given 
rise in my mind to some reflections that prompt me to recall to your remembrance, in the most humble and respectful manner, the circumstances under which I felt constrained, by every principle of 
patriotism and personal honour, to accept or volunteer for the command of the Congress. 
</p><p>
Having performed, in the best way I could, the duty assigned to me in Texas, I returned to the United States, to bring the glad 
tidings- of annexation, and to explain to you my views (the importance of which I no doubt overrated) in regard to our relations with Mexico. During those conversations I stated to you that I thought 
Mexico would probably, when ready, commence hostilities. You suggested that it was important to have the Princeton back in the Gulf as soon as possible, that a constant and certain communication 
might be kept up with Vera Cruz ; and mentioned Commander Engle as the officer whom you thought of ordering to command her, 
and ordered me to make the necessary arrangements to fit out the Constellation. My only desire was to do as you wished, and to be 
ready, with a good ship under me, to take part any part in the expected conflict in the Gulf. I was satisfied with the Princeton ; 
I applied for no change ; I suggested none. But, as you wanted the Princeton as a tender to Commodore Conner, and offered me the Constellation in her place, I was still better pleased, because I 
thought I was pleasing you and at the same time would have a ship larger, stronger, and more effective even, than the Princeton, and that I would then be ready for war, come from where it might. 
You changed your notions, and ordered me to proceed no farther with the Constellation. The Princeton had gone to the Gulf, and I was a volunteer idler on shore, having left a cruising ship at a time 
of threatened hostilities. To relieve myself from this painful situation you offered me no facility, and I saw no way open but to apply to fit out the Congress or some other ship. If you had time to 
give to my poor character and position a few moments consideration, I am sure you would appreciate the feelings which prompted me to ask to fit out the Congress, and would not suppose for one 
moment that I could have volunteered to command the Congress as she now is, with sealed orders and twelve passengers- men, women, and children. My great object in the first place was to be 
prepared, in the event of a war with Mexico, to try to do something creditable to the navy. If Mexico did not make war, I wanted then to get a ship ready for England, that might be able to keep 
the station to which she was ordered, and not to go cruising about with passengers in time of peace, and in war to run away (as the Congress must necessarily do) from the English squadron in the 
Pacific. They not only have a much larger squadron, led by an eighty-gun-ship, but have means of communication which will enable them to receive their despatches months before we can. 
</p><p>
But here I am ; and, whatever that ominous-looking package may contain, and wherever I am ordered to go, or whatever I am ordered to do, by the leave of Providence there I will go, and that I will do, in the best way I can. 
</p><p>

SIR : On my arrival here with the Congress and Savannah in pursuit of the Walla-Walla Indians, I was glad to find that their 
numbers had been greatly exaggerated and that they were friendly-disposed. 
</p><p>
I have a message from the chief stating that he was friendly and would come down to see me. I will send the Savannah on her 
cruise to-morrow, and the Portsmouth in a few days, and will follow myself in the Congress as soon as I can, (if not sooner superseded 
by Commodore Biddle,) to carry out my views in regard to Mexico, with which I have not thought it necessary or expedient yet to acquaint the Department. 
</p><p>
Our new government goes on well. I am arranging for a weekly mail from one end of the territory to the other : it will not, 
I think, cost over three or four thousand dollars per annum, which will be less expensive than the necessary expenses to keep one properly informed in regard to every part of the territory. 
</p><p>
If any chance is given, I have no doubt an effort will be made by the Mexicans to recover the territory. Troops are ready to come 
from Mexico ; but, if they are not seen on their way, I ll make them fight their first battle at Acapulco, or between that and the city of Mexico. 
</p><p>
I have not, it is true, a great force; but their enthusiasm and impetuosity must make up the want of numbers.

I will merely say that I have this evening received information, by two deserters from the rebel camp, of the arrival of an additional force in this neighbourhood of one hundred men, which, in 
addition to the force previously here, makes their number about one hundred and fifty.

SIR : In answer to your note received this afternoon, I need say but little more than that which I communicated to you in a conversation at San Diego : that California was conquered, and a civil 
government put into successful operation ; that a copy of the laws made by me for the government of the territory, and the names of 
the officers selected to see them faithfully executed, were transmitted to the President of the United States before you arrived in the territory. 
</p><p>
I will only add, that I cannot do any thing nor desist from doing any thing on your demand, which I will submit to the President and ask for your recall. In the mean time you will consider yourself 
suspended from the command of the United States forces in this place. 
</p><p>

</p><p>

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TRUE AMERICAN : 
</p><p>
I notice in the papers of the day, have learned from letters, and heard in private circles, that my name is spoken of in connection 
with the office of United States Senator for New Jersey. 
</p><p>
With gratitude to those of my fellow-citizens who have named me for that high office, I must nevertheless say, frankly and at once, that I decline it. 
</p><p>
However averse I may be to enter into questions of party politics, still, permit me to express the hope that the appointment of Senator 
may be conferred on some one whose heart and hand and voice is pledged to the Union of the States at all hazards, and to the sup 
port of the compromises of the Constitution and the execution of the laws with unfaltering fidelity. 
</p><p>
Survive who may, perish who will, the Union must be preserved. To this sentiment, for one, I set my hand and heart, and on its 
maintenance I am now, as I ever have been, ready to pledge my life, my fortune, and my honour. The people of New Jersey have, 
at the late election, adopted it and made it theirs, and every citizen everywhere, who loves his country and his race, will respond to it with enthusiasm.

</p><p>
SIR: I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatches of the 15th of May, addressed to my predecessor, and sent by Passed Midshipman McRae, who delivered them to me on board of this ship on the night of the 7th 
of September, soon after we came to anchor in the bay of  Santa Barbara where I stopped on my way to this place to take on board a detachment of men 
which I left for the defence of that place, after we had taken it on our wav to San Pedro. 
</p><p>
I am happy to say, in answer to that despatch, that all your instructions contained therein had been anticipated and executed, and my proceedings forwarded to you by different routes two weeks before the arrival of Mr. McRae even that 
part of them suggesting that a messenger be sent across the mountains to Washngton ; which messenger I hope you will have seen and sent back to me before I his can reach you. 
</p><p>
I send enclosed the correspondence between <a href='/results.php?tla=jsc' rel='adversary'>General Castro</a> and myself. I did not answer his last letter, but by a verbal message, which does not properly Belong to history. We found in and near his camp ten pieces of artillery six 
in good order, and four spiked. 
</p><p>
The elections as far as heard from have been regularly held, and the proper officers elected. The people are getting over their first alarm, and our friends be not now afraid to avow themselves. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jsc' rel='adversary'>General Castro</a> and the governor having collected at one time so large a force together, and our remaining inactive at Monterey, induced the belief that we 
were not willing to run the hazard of a fight, and that if we did we must be beaten. No one, foreigner or native, dared aid us even with advice or information. 
</p><p>
But, since Castro and the governor have been driven out of the country, the aspect of things is changed, and all is going on as well as we ought to desire. 
</p><p>
By an intercepted correspondence between the military commandant at Mazatlan and <a href='/results.php?tla=jsc' rel='adversary'>General Castro</a>, it appears that arrangements were making to send 
troops into California, and <a href='/results.php?tla=jsc' rel='adversary'>General Castro</a> is strongly urged to destroy the "nefarious enemy". But it is too late. 
</p><p>
I take the opportunity of this communication to remind you of two things that may be of some importance to be remembered. 
</p><p>
1. That neither San Francisco or Monterey are susceptible, within any reasonable expense, of being defended from an attack made from the interior; every 
commanding position within reach of a cannon-ball from the water is overlooked by adjacent hills, within gunshot. We must, therefore, hold the country along 
the sea-coast as far south as St. Lucas, and make the river Gila and a line drawn from that river across to the Del Norte the southern boundary, all of 
which is now in our possession. It is not my business, perhaps, to say more on the subject. I will send you, however, a map which I have made, and on which 
I have traced with red ink the boundary line above suggested. 
</p><p>
2. That this territory within the lines marked by me should be retained by the United States, as indispensable to preserve the lives and property of our 
fellow-citizens residing here, as well as to secure any thing like permanent peace. 
</p><p>
I have put some guns on board the store-ship Erie, and made a cruiser of her. She will sail on a cruise immediately, to circulate the enclosed notice and 
to look out for privateers, and will touch at Panama to deliver and receive despatches. 
</p><p>
As soon as the schooner Shark returns from the Columbia River, I will send her on a cruise for the protection of our whale-ships. 
</p><p>
The Savannah, Portsmouth, and Cyane will continue the blockade of the 
coast of Mexico, while I will in the Congress go up the Gulf of California and 
pay my respects to San Jose, La Paz, Loreto, and Guaymas, thence along the 
Mexican coast, thence to the Sandwich Islands, thence to San Francisco. 
</p><p>
The Warren will be obliged to lay by for extensive repairs. 
</p><p>
By which disposition of the squadron I hope to meet your approbation, as 
well as the views of Mr. Webster and his friends, who signed the letter to the 
President which I found among your last despatches. Besides, I will order the 
ships of the blockading squadron occasionally to change their ground and take 
a cruise, one after the other, for the protection of the whalers. By these courses 
we will cross each other's track, and so traverse the ocean as to render it some 
what hazardous for a privateer to be dodging about within our circle. 
</p><p>
Faithfully, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
R. F. STOCKTON, Commodore, &c. 
</p><p>
Your letter to Commodore Biddle will be sent to the Sandwich Islands by the American ship Brooklyn, which leaves this place in a day or two for Honolulu.

SIR: I herewith enclose to you your commission as military commandant of this department. 
</p><p>
Martial law will continue in force throughout the whole territory, until otherwise ordered by the governor of the same. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding, however, the existence of martial law, you will permit the civil officers of the government to proceed in the exercise of their proper functions, nor will you interfere with their duties, except in cases where the peace and safety of the territory requires your aid or interference. 
</p><p>
You will take care that my proclamation of the 17th be strictly observed throughout this department, except as to those persons who may be exempted by your written order from the operation of its provisions. 
</p><p>
You are authorized, whenever it can be prudently done, to give written per mission to persons known to be friendly to the government to be out them 
selves, and to send their servants out before sunrise in the morning. 
</p><p>
You are likewise authorized to grant permission, where you see tit, to persons known to be friendly, to carry arms with them, whenever it appears to you they 
stand in need of them for their own or their servants protection. 
</p><p>
I enclose to you, also, some blank commissions for prefects and alcaldes, that, 
in ease the people should fail to elect either of those officers within the jurisdiction of this department, you may fill up the blank with the name of some 
one you may think is qualified and will accept the office, affixing the date thereto, and transmitting to me at San Francisco, by the first opportunity, the name and date of all appointments made by you. 
</p><p>
Whenever opportunity offers, you will write to me as to the state of the country and the feelings of the people within this department.

SIR : I am informed by express from <a href='/results.php?tla=jbm' rel='co-worker'>Commander Montgomery</a>, at San Francisco, that Suter's Fort, on the Sacramento, is threatened by a thousand Indians from the Oregon, of the Walla-Walla tribe.

The cause of their hostility appears to be this : about a year since one of their chiefs was deliberately murdered at Suter's Fort by a man named Cook.

The Erie is under way, and I have only time to say that I shall go after them immediately with the crews of this ship and the Savannah, and I will give them

</p><p>
SIR : By the celebrated Mexican armed brig Malek Adhel, which was captured and taken out of the harbour of Mazatlan by the boats of the United States 
ship Warren, I have the honour to send this despatch for you as far as Mazatlan, and to say that several other vessels perhaps thirteen or fourteen have been 
captured by the Cyane and Warren, official reports of which, however, have not yet reached me ; but I have reason to hope and believe that every vessel by 
which our commerce in this ocean could probably be interrupted has been captured by Commander Hull, in the Warren, or Commander Dupont, in the Cyane. 
</p><p>
Those officers deserve praise for the manner in which they have blockaded and watched the Mexican coast during the most inclement season of the year. 
</p><p>
The enclosed letters, from No. 1 to 4, will acquaint you with the position of the squadron and the affairs of this territory, as well as with my intentions in regard to the further prosecution of the war up to the 30th September, when 
the intelligence reached me that all the Mexican officers in the territory, with the exception of one or two, had violated their oaths, and again taken up arms 
against the United States, with which insurrection, and the consequent alteration of all my preconcerted plans, it will be the further object of this despatch to make you acquainted. 
</p><p>
The war in California being, as I supposed, at an end, and having ordered the other ships of the squadron to the coast of Mexico, there to await my arrival, I was about to transfer the government of California to other hands, and to sail 
as soon as possible in the Congress for Acapulco, where I expected to land and lend our aid to the war in that part of Mexico, when I was informed by express that the Mexican officers had violated their oaths and commenced anew the war 
by a midnight attack on the party of fifty men left at Ciudad de los Angeles. 
</p><p>
The enclosed proclamation, No. 5, signed by Jose Ma Flores, a captain in the Mexican army, and on parole, will give you some idea of the disposition of those depraved men. 
</p><p>
At this time <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Major Fremont</a> had gone to the Sacramento to enlist men for me to take to Acapulco. I immediately sent to him to come to San Francisco, with 
as many men and saddles as he could get to embark in the ship Sterling, that we might by prompt action surprise the enemy at Santa Barbara, only three 
days march from De los Angeles ; while I would go directly to San Pedro and march to the city, where I would certainly be able to calculate within a day or two the time I would receive his co-operation. 
</p><p>
While the necessary preparations were making to carry out this plan of surprise and at once to put down tne insurrection, I ordered the Savannah (then 
under sailing orders for the coast of Mexico) to go immediately to San Pedro, and afford all the aid in her power to our little garrison at the city. 
</p><p>
I left San Francisco in company with the Sterling ; but, having crossed the bar before her, I hove to till she came out, and then I steered with a fair wind 
down along the coast. On our way we spoke the ship Barnstable from Monterey with despatches from the commanding officer there, stating that Monterey 
would probably be attacked, and that he required immediate reinforcement. I went immediately to Monterey, leaving the Sterling with a fair wind on her way to Santa Barbara. 
</p><p>
I arrived the next day at Monterey, and landed two officers, Messrs. Baldwin and Johnston, with fifty men and three pieces of artillery ; and, having fortified 
the town against any probable force in California, I left for San Pedro, looking into Santa Barbara, as I passed, to see how the Sterling made out ; but she had 
not arrived, although she ought to have been there several days previous. 
</p><p>
I passed on to San Pedro, where I found the Savannah. Captain Mervine, commander of the Savannah, informed me that on his arrival there he found on board of the ship Vandalia the party of volunteers who had been besieged at the 
Pueblo, and to whose assistance he had been despatched, but who had been permitted by treaty to retire with their arms on board of this vessel ; that about 
two weeks before my arrival he had landed with his men and the above-mentioned volunteers, and marched for the city ; that he met a body of mounted 
men with a field-piece, with whom he had an engagement ; that he had not taken any artillery with him, and they had driven him back to his ship, with 
the loss of four men killed and some wounded; and that he had remained on board since that time waiting for me. 
</p><p>
He says that his officers and men behaved well; that they made several efforts to take the field-piece from the enemy, but they could not overtake it. 
In truth, nothing short of a locomotive engine can catch those well-mounted fellows. 
</p><p>
I did not like this proceeding or its probable consequences ; but I have no more to say about it at present. Elated by this transient success, which the enemy, with his usual want of veracity, magnified into a great victory, they 
collected in large bodies on all the adjacent hills, and would not permit a hoof except their own horses to be within fifty miles of San Pedro. 
</p><p>
I had, however, agreed to land there, to be in readiness to co-operate with the 
forces under <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Major Fremont</a> expected from Santa Barbara; and therefore determined to do so in the face of their boasting insolence, and there again to 
hoist the glorious stars in the presence of their horse-covered hills. 
</p><p>
Orders were accordingly given to prepare to land the troops in the morning, and a party of the volunteers, as you will see by a general order here enclosed 
and marked No. 6, were ordered to land before daylight, to cover the general landing, which was to be made up a very steep bank and in the face of the enemy. 
</p><p>
The volunteers failed to land in time, in consequence of a fancied force of the enemy. Not so with the sailors and marines, who were ready in the boats 
alongside of the two ships, and whom, as soon as I discovered that the volunteers had not succeeded, I ordered to land. The boats of the Savannah were under 
the immediate command of Captain Mervine ; those of the Congress under the immediate command of Lieutenant-Commandant Livingston, and performed the service in a most gallant manner, being myself present. 
</p><p>
On our approach to the shore, the enemy fired a few muskets without harm and tied ; we took possession, and once more hoisted our flag at San Pedro. 
General order, marked No. 7, will show you how I estimated the conduct of the troops at the time. 
</p><p>
The troops remained encamped at that place for several days before the insurgents, who covered the adjacent hills, and until both officers and men had 
become almost worn out by chasing and skirmishing with and watching them, and until I had given up all hope of the co-operation of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Major Fremont</a>. Besides, the enemy had driven off every animal, man and beast, from that section of the country, and it was not possible, by any means in our power, to carry provisions for our march to the city. 
</p><p>
I resolved, therefore, to embark the troops, and waste no more time there, but to go down South, and, if possible, to get animals somewhere along the coast 
before the enemy could know or prevent it, and to mount my own men and march to the city by the Southern route. 
</p><p>
I left the Savannah to look out for <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Major Fremont</a>, and, taking the volunteers on board of the Congress, proceeded down the coast as far as San Diego, where Lieutenant Minor was in command. 
</p><p>
Two days after my arrival at San Diego, the Malek Adhel arrived from Monterey, with despatches from <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Major Fremont</a>, in which he says: We met 
the Vandalia with information of the occurrences below. Mr. Howard represented that the enemy had driven off all the horses and cattle, so that it would 
be impossible to obtain either for transportation or supplies. Under the circumstances, and in virtue of the discretionary authority you have given me, I judged 
it of paramount necessity to haul up immediately for this port, with the intention to send for all the men who could be raised in the North and for the band 
of horses which I had left on the Cosumne. In the mean time we should be able to check the insurrection here, and procure horses and supplies, so as to be in 
readiness to march to the southward immediately on the arrival of our reinforcements. 7 
</p><p>
On the receipt of this letter, having arranged with Lieutenant Minor to send a vessel down the coast for horses and cattle, I returned to San Pedro, and sent 
the Savannah back to Monterey, to facilitate, as far as I could, the preparations of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Major Fremont</a>. 
</p><p>
On my return at San Diego, I found that the expedition South had been successful, that the party had obtained about sixty useful horses, two hundred head of cattle, and five hundred sheep. 
</p><p>
On the afternoon of our arrival, the enemy, irritated, I suppose, by the loss of his animals, came down in considerable force and made an attack ; they were, 
however, soon driven back, with the loss of two men and horses killed, and four wounded. Those skirmishes or running fights are of almost daily occurrence ; 
since we have been here we have lost, as yet, but one man killed and one wounded. 
</p><p>
One hundred more horses will enable me to mount some of my own men, and, before long, I expect to be a general of dragoons, as well as commodore, governor, and commander-in-chief. 
</p><p>
I have been thus particular in this despatch, that you may see that all that unflinching labour and perseverance on my part, and inflexible patriotism and 
courage on the part of my officers and men, could do to suppress this rebellion, has been done, and that, although we may still be for some time annoyed by 
those daily skirmishes, yet the rebels cannot, in all probability, much longer avert the doom that awaits them. Faithfully, your obedient servant,

SIR : You will, as soon as you are ready, proceed to sea under your sealed orders, with this modification, however : you will, on falling in with the Cyane, 
send her immediately to San Francisco, instead of detaining her on the coast as heretofore directed. 
</p><p>
The Congress and Cyane will, by this arrangement, it is expected, be ready to relieve the Savannah and Portsmouth. 
</p><p>
If despatches from the government should arrive at Mazatlan between this and the first of December, you will open them ; and, if notice of peace, you will 
leave copies of the despatches at Mazatlan for me, in case I should arrive there after you have left, and come to San Francisco and prepare the Savannah to return to the United States. 
</p><p>
If Mr. Norris should arrive from the United States at Mazatlan before I reach there, you will bring him in the Savannah or send him in the Portsmouth 
as soon as possible to this place, without opening the despatches. The enclosed letter contains a despatch for the Secretary of the Navy. You will please to 
make every exertion, without regard to expense, to get it forwarded by Mr. Mott, or some one else. 
</p><p>
You will also draw for the use of this squadron any sum of money, not exceeding one hundred thousand dollars, that you may be enabled to get at Mazatlan. 
</p><p>
Please to seal the letter to Mott, Talbot & Co. before you deliver it ; I leave it open in case you should find it best to deliver the despatch to other hands.

</p><p>
SIR: My last letter to the department will have informed you of the defeat of Captain Mervine at San Pedro, and the return of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Colonel Fremont</a>, with the 
force under his command, to Monterey, since which time I have not heard from him ; and of my being at San Diego, surrounded by the insurgents, and entirely 
destitute of all means of transportation. We succeeded at last, however, in getting animals two hundred and forty miles to the southward of San Diego, 
and in driving them, in despite of the insurgents, into the garrison. 
</p><p>
I have now the honour to inform you that it has pleased God to crown our poor efforts to put down the rebellion, and to retrieve the credit of our arms with the 
most complete success. The insurgents, again elated by the defeat of <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> at San Pasqual, and the capture of one of his guns, determined with 
his whole force to meet us on our march from San Diego to this place, and to decide the fate of the territory by a general battle. 
</p><p>
Having made the best preparation I could in the face of a boasting and vigilant enemy, we left San Diego on the 29th day of December (that portion of 
the insurgent army who had been watching and annoying us having left to join the main body) with about six hundred fighting men, composed of detachments 
from the ships Congress, Savannah, Portsmouth, and Cyane, aided by <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> with a detachment of sixty men on foot from the first regiment of 
United States dragoons, and with <a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a> with sixty mounted rifle men. 
</p><p>
We marched nearly one hundred and forty miles in ten days, and found the rebels on the 8th day of January, in a strong position, on the high bank of the 
Rio San Gabriel, with six hundred mounted men and four pieces of artillery, prepared to dispute our passage across that river. 
</p><p>
We waded through the water, dragging our guns after us, against the galling fire of the enemy, without exchanging a shot until we reached the opposite 
shore, when the fight became general, and our troops, having repelled a charge of the enemy, charged up the bank in a most gallant manner, and gained a most complete victory over the insurgent army. 
</p><p>
The next day, on our march across the plains of the Mesa to this place, the 
insurgents made another desperate effort to save the capital and their own necks; 
they were concealed with their artillery in a ravine until we came within gun 
shot, when they opened a brisk fire from their field-pieces on our right flank, 
and at the same time charged both on our front and rear. We soon silenced 
their guns and repelled the charge, when they fled and permitted us the next 
morning to march into town without any further opposition. 
</p><p>
We have rescued the country from the hands of the insurgents, but I fear that the absence of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Colonel Fremont</a>'s battalion of mounted riflemen will enable 
most of the Mexican officers who have broken their parole to escape to Sonora. 
</p><p>
I am happy to say that our loss in killed and wounded does not exceed twenty, while we are informed that the enemy has lost between seventy and eighty. 
</p><p>
This despatch must go immediately, and I will wait another opportunity to furnish you with the details of these two battles, and the gallant conduct of the officers and men under my command, with their names.

</p><p>
SIR: Referring to my letter of the 11th, I have the honour to inform you of the arrival of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont</a> at this place with four hundred men; 
that some of the insurgents have made their escape to Sonora, and that the rest have surrendered to our arms. 
</p><p>
Immediately after the battles of the 8th and 9th, they began to disperse; and I am sorry to say that their leader, Jose M. Flores, made his escape, and that 
the others have been pardoned by a capitulation agreed upon by <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont</a>. 
</p><p>
Jose M. Flores, the commander of the insurgent forces, two or three days 
previous to the 8th sent two commissioners, with a flag of truce, to my camp to 
make a treaty of peace. I informed the commissioners that I could not recognise Jose M. Flores, who had broken his parole, as an honourable man, or as 
one having any rightful authority, or worthy to be treated with; that he was a rebel in arms, and, if I caught him, I would have him shot. 
</p><p>
It seemed that, not being able to negotiate with me, and having lost the battles of the 8th and 9th, they met <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Colonel Fremont</a> on the 12th instant on his 
way here, who, not knowing what had occurred, entered into the capitulation with them, which I now send to you ; and, although I refused to do it myself, 
still I have thought it best to approve it. I am glad to say that, by the capitulation, we have recovered the gun taken by the insurgents at the sad defeat of <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> at San Pasqual. 
</p><p>
The territory of California is again tranquil, and the civil government, formed by me, is again in operation in the places where it was interrupted by the insurgents. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Colonel Fremont</a> has five hundred men in his battalion, which will be quite sufficient to preserve the peace of the territory ; and I will immediately with 
draw my sailors and marines, and sail as soon as possible for the coast of Mexico, where I hope they will give a good account of themselves. 
</p><p>
Faithfully, your obedient servant,

SIR : I have the honour to inform you that the civil government of this territory is in successful operation, that <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Colonel Fremont</a> is acting as governor and 
Colonel Russell as secretary, and that I am again on board of the Congress, preparing her for the coast of Mexico.

Lieutenant Gray, who is charged with my despatches, has been my aid-de camp, and has done his duty with great good conduct and gallantry. 
</p><p>
He is the officer whom I sent to relieve <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> from his perilous condition after his defeat at San Pasqual, and deserves the consideration of the department. 
</p><p>
He will be able to give you the particulars of that unfortunate and disastrous affair.

</p><p>
SIR: As the guardian of the honour and services of the navy, I take leave to send to you the following narrative. This case requires no argument ; nor will 
I make a single remark in relation to the extraordinary conduct of <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> or the indefensible language of his notes: demands, personal collision,  civil war and the bold assertion that the country was not conquered until the 8th and 9th of January by the troops under his command, speak for themselves. 
</p><p>
I only desire at this time that you will call the attention of the President to 
it, and ask that <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> may be recalled from the territory, to prevent 
the evil consequences that may grow out of such a temper and such a head. 
</p><p>
Last September I ordered an express mail to be sent in charge of Mr. Carson from the Ciudad de los Angeles to the city of Washington, to inform the 
President that the territory of California had been conquered and a civil government established therein. Mr. Carson was met on his way, and only within 
four days travel of Santa Fe, by <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, to whom he communicated the above intelligence, and that <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Colonel Fremont</a> was to be governor. <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> sent back to Santa Fe a large part of the force under his command, but 
came himself to the territory with a detachment of dragoons; he would not permit Mr. Carson to proceed with the express, but insisted that he should return with 
him to California. On the 3d of December I received a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> by Mr. E. Stokes, which I now enclose, marked No. 1. I immediately 
despatched <a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a> and Mr. Stokes, with about thirty-nine mounted riflemen, to the Head-quarters of the army of the West with the letter marked 
No. 2. Mr. Stokes said that the General had informed him that he had about three hundred and fifty men with him. 
</p><p>
On the night of the 6th Mr. Stokes returned to San Diego, and informed me that <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> had attempted to surprise the insurgents early that morning in their camp at San Pasqual ; that a battle ensued, in which the General 
was worsted, but to what extent he could not accurately state, because he came off immediately after the firing ceased, without communicating with any one on 
the field of battle ; that the General had lost many killed and wounded, and one 
of his guns had been taken; that the insurgents were commanded by Andres Pico, who had with him about one hundred men. The next day, Mr. Godey 
came in express from the General's camp, and confirmed the sad intelligence of his defeat, bringing the enclosed letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=hst' rel='colleague met'>Captain Turner</a> of the dragoons, marked No. 3. 
</p><p>
On Wednesday night, the 9th instant, Lieutenant Beale, of the navy, came in from the General's camp, and stated that the force under <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>'s 
command had attempted to surprise the insurgents on the morning of the 6th at San Pasqual ; that in the fight which ensued <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> had been defeated, 
with the loss of eighteen or nineteen killed, and thirteen or fourteen wounded; that <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> and his whole force were besieged on a small hill of rocks, 
and so surrounded by the enemy that it was impossible for them to escape unless immediate assistance was sent to them ; that all their cattle had been taken 
away from them, and that they were obliged to eat their mules ; that they were burning and destroying a quantity of valuable public property tents, saddles 
and bridles, and camp equipage of every description, as well as private stores and clothing. Lieutenant Gray was leaving San Diego with two hundred and 
fifteen men, to go to the relief of <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, at the moment of the arrival of Mr. Beale. He succeeded in bringing the General and his troops safely into 
San Diego. A few days after the General's arrival at San Diego, I offered to him the situation of Commander-in-chief of the forces then preparing for a campaign, and offered to go with him as his { aid-de-camp. He declined this pro 
position, but said he would go as my  aid-de-camp. Soon after this he handed me his instructions from the War Department, which, having read, I returned 
to him with the enclosed note, marked No. 4. A short time after this, the General, in a conversation with me, intimated that, under his instructions from 
the War Department, he was entitled to be the governor of the territory. I replied that his instructions expressly said  that should he conquer the country he 
might establish a civil government therein ; that the country had been conquered, and a civil government established, before he left Santa Fe, of which he 
had been informed, as before stated, by Mr. Carson, when he was only four 
days travel from Santa Fe I also said that his instructions from the War Department, under these circumstances, should in my judgment be considered 
obsolete arid nugatory; that, as the thing ordered to be done had been accomplished already, there remained nothing to be done; that the civil government 
formed by me was, at the time we were talking about it, in actual operation throughout the territory, with the exception of the Ciudad de los Angeles 
and Santa Barbara, where it had been temporarily interrupted by the insurgents; besides which, I had informed the government that I would appoint 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Colonel Fremont</a> governor, and had pledged myself to <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Colonel Fremont</a> to do so. 
That the thing was therefore before the government, and their approval or disapproval was probably on its way to me; and that if he had not interfered with my 
express, it probably would have returned from Washington by the middle of January. I supposed from this conversation, in connection with the offer of the 
General to accompany me as aid-de-camp, that he would not again aspire to the chief command of the territory until after the expected despatches had arrived from Washington. 
</p><p>
The relations between <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> and myself remained in this condition until the morning of the 20th of December, when, after the troops had been 
paraded and were ready to proceed on the march to the Ciudad de los Angeles, <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> came to me and asked who was to command the 
troops. I said that, as commander-in-chief, I would command in person. 
But, said he, I mean who is to command the troops under you? I said that I had appointed Lieutenant Ho wan, the first lieutenant of the Cyane, to do 
so. The General observed that he thought he was entitled to that command. I 
replied, that Mr. Rowan had been appointed merely to relieve me from the details of the march and camp ; and that if he (the General) was willing to perform that duty, I did not doubt that Lieutenant Rowan would yield to him, and 
I would give him the appointment with pleasure. 
</p><p>
Lieutenant Rowan yielded, and I immediately summoned the officers around me, who were in readiness to march, and announced to them that <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> would take Mr. Rowan's situation, but that I would remain commander-in-chief. 
</p><p>
With this arrangement we proceeded on our march, during which I ordered when the troops were to march, the road they were to march, and when they 
were to encamp, and did all other things belonging or appertaining to the duties as the commander of the forces and the governor of the territory, and no one 
paid more respect and deference to me as such than <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> ; and it never was more conspicuous than in the battles of the 8th and 9th of January, as well as during our march into the city. 
</p><p>
On the 16th of January I received the enclosed letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, marked No. 5, by the address of which you will perceive that I am still considered by him acting governor of the territory, at the very moment he arrogates to himself the supreme power of demanding of me to desist from the 
performance of my duties. I also send my reply, marked No. 6, and his rejoinder, marked No. 7, with a note subsequently received from him, marked No. 8.

Faithfully, your obedient servant,

HARBOUR OF <a href='/results.php?city=san diego' rel='city origin'>SAN DIEGO</a>, <a rel="month origin" value="2">February</a> <a rel='day origin' value='5'>5</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1847' rel="origin">1847</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR: I had the honour to write to you on the 11th of January, by my aid-de-camp, Lieutenant Gray, informing you of the victories gained on the 8th and 
9th of January over the insurgent army by the forces under my command ; that the insurrection had been put down, and peace and tranquillity restored through 
out the territory ; that we had again taken possession of the Ciudad de los Angeles ; that our flag was once more flying in all parts of California ; and that the 
civil government formed by me last September was in successful operation. 
</p><p>
I now proceed (as it is my duty to do) to give you a more detailed and circumstantial account of the battles of the 8th and 9th, as well as of the preparations 
which preceded them. We came to San Diego with the Congress alone, her resources having been almost exhausted in a previous campaign. The town was 
besieged by the insurgents, and there were no stores or provisions of any kind in it, and-we were reduced to one-fourth allowance of bread. We had to build a 
fort to mount our artillery, to make our saddles and bridles and harness ; we had, in truth, to make an army, with all its necessary appendages, out of the 
mechanics and sailors of this ship, and to take our horses and beef cattle from the enemy. 
</p><p>
The industry, perseverance, and hard work, as well as enterprise and courage necessary for such operations, do not need my poor commendation. 
</p><p>
We commenced our march on the 29th of December, with <a href='/results.php?tla=hst' rel='colleague met'>Captain Turner</a>'s company of 1st dragoons, dismounted, aided by Lieutenant Davidson : six pieces 
of artillery under Lieutenant R. L. Tilghman and Passed Midshipman William II. Thompson ; <a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a>'s squadron of mounted riflemen, acting as the 
advance, the rear, and vanguards ; Hie marines of the Congress and Portsmouth, under Captain J. Zeilin, adjutant of the battalion ; the musketeers of the Congress, Savannah, Cyane, and Portsmouth, commanded by Lieutenant William 
B. Rerishaw, Passed Midshipman John Guest, Acting Lieutenants B. F. B. Hunter and Edward Higgins, aided by Midshipmen George E. Morgan, J. Van Ness 
Philip, Theodoric Lee, Albert Allmand, B. F. Wells, Edward C. Grafton, Robert C. Duvall, and Philip II. Ilaywood, arid William Simmons, commodore's clerk; 
the carbineers of the Congress and Cyane, under the orders of Passed Midshipmen J. M. Duncan and J. Fenwick Stenson, and Sailmaker Reed, aided by Mid 
shipmen Joseph Parish and Edmund Shepherd ; in all, a strength of about six hundred men. Brigadier-<a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> commanding the division, and Lieutenant S. C. Rowan, from the ship Cyane, major of brigade ; Captain W. H. Emory, of the topographical engineers, acting adjutant-general; Lieutenant 
George Minor, of the Savannah, quarter-master, in charge of the transportation, aided by Mr. Daniel Fisher. Mr. Speiden, the purser of the Congress, performed 
the duties of commissary, aided by Mr. John Bid well. Mr. South wick, carpenter of the Congress, acted as chief engineer at the head of the sappers and 
miners. Dr. John S. Griffin, of the army, Dr. Andrew A. Henderson, of the Portsmouth, and Dr. Charles Eversfield, of the Congress, attended the troops. 
Lieutenant A. F. V. Gray and Captain Miguel de Pedrovena, aids-de-camp to the commander-in-chief. 
</p><p>
Our men were badly clothed, and their shoes generally made by themselves out of canvas. It was very cold, and the roads heavy. Our animals were all 
poor and weak, some of them giving out daily, which gave much hard work to the men in dragging the heavy carts, loaded with ammunition and provisions, 
through deep sands and up steep ascents, and the prospect before us was far from being that which we might have desired ; but nothing could break down 
the fine spirits of those under my command, or cool their readiness and ardour to perform their duty ; and they went through the whole march of one hundred and forty-five miles with alacrity and cheerfulness. 
</p><p>
During the day of our march to the cayotes, we learned that some of the enemy were in our rear following us ; and as we approached the cayotes several 
of them made their appearance in front of the house upon the hill, and waved their lances in angry defiance ; but on the approach of the advance guard they rode off and left us to encamp on the hill near the house without molestation. 
</p><p>
Being quite satisfied that we were in the neighbourhood of the enemy, during the night a confidential person was sent to ascertain, if possible, their position ; 
he returned, and informed me that the enemy were in force between us and the Rio San Gabriel, and I was satisfied that the enemy intended at last to make a 
stand against us, and to fight us on the 8th day of January. The day suited me. Before moving that morning, the arms were fired and reloaded, and each 
officer and man was assigned his position for the fight, and was reminded that it was the 8th day of January and the anniversary of the battle of New Orleans. 
</p><p>
We marched at nine o clock. Immediately on reaching the plain we formed a square, our baggage-packs, spare oxen, and beef cattle in the centre. The 
advance guard under Captain Hensley, company C, first dragoons, under <a href='/results.php?tla=hst' rel='colleague met'>Captain Turner</a>, and company D, musketeers of the Cyane, under Acting Lieutenant Higgins, occupied the centre, with two pieces of artillery on each flank, 
under Lieutenant Tilghman. The right flank composed of marines, company C, 
musketeers of the Portsmouth, Acting Lieutenant Hunter; company C, carbineers, Passed Midshipman Duncan ; company A, carbineers of the Cyane, 
Acting Master Stenson ; and company A, carbineers of the Congress, Sailmaker Peco ; the whole under command of Captain Zeilin. The left flank composed 
of company B, musketeers of the Savannah, company A, musketeers of the Congress, under Acting Master Guest ; the whole under the command of Lieutenant Renshaw. The rear composed of two pieces of artillery, under Acting Master 
William H. Thompson. The guard of the day, forty-nine strong, under Midshipman Haywood ; one company mounted riflemen, under Lieutenant Renshaw ; 
and Captain Santiago E. Arguello's company of Californians, under Lieutenant Luis Arguello ; the whole under the command of <a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a>. When 
within about two miles of the Rio San Gabriel, the enemy appeared in sight upon the hills on the opposite side ; they were six hundred in number, in 
three divisions, their right about two miles down the river. As we approached, 
our column closed up and moved steadily on towards the ford, when, within a quarter of a mile of the river, a halt was ordered and dispositions made to meet the enemy. 
</p><p>
A detachment of marines, under Lieutenant H. B. Watson, was sent to strengthen the left flank of the square. A party of the enemy, one hundred 
and fifty strong, had now crossed the river and made several ineffectual attempts to drive a band of wild mares upon the advance party. We now moved forward 
to the ford in broken files ; Captain Hensley's command was ordered to dismount, and, acting as skirmishers, it deployed to the front and crossed the 
stream, (which is about fifty yards in width,) driving before them a party of the 
enemy which had attempted to annoy us. The enemy had now taken their position upon the heights, distant six hundred yards from the river and about fifty 
feet above its level ; their centre or main body, about two hundred strong, was stationed immediately in front of the ford, upon which they opened a fire from 
two pieces of artillery, throwing round and grape shot without effect. Their right and left wings were separated from the main body about three hundred 
yards. Our column halted upon the edge of the stream ; at this time the guns 
were unlimbered to return the enemy's fire, but were ordered again to be limbered and not a gun to be fired until the opposite bank of the river was gained. 
The two nine-pounders, dragged by officers as well as men and mules, soon reached the opposite bank, when they were immediately placed in battery. The column 
now followed in order under a most galling fire from the enemy, and became 
warmly engaged on the opposite bank, their round shot and grape falling thickly among us as we approached the stream, without doing any injury, our men 
marching steadily forward. The dragoons and Cyane's musketeers, occupying the centre, soon crossed and formed upon a bank about four feet above the 
stream. The left, advancing at the same time, soon occupied its position across the river. 
</p><p>
The rear was longer in getting across the water; the sand being deep, its passage was delayed by the baggage carts ; however, in a few moments the 
passage of the whole force was effected with only one man killed and one wounded, notwithstanding the enemy kept up an incessant fire from the heights. 
</p><p>
On taking a position upon the low bank, the right flank, under Captain Zeilin, 
was ordered to deploy to the right ; two guns from the rear were immediately 
brought to the right ; the four-pounder, under Acting Master Thompson, sup 
ported by the riflemen under Lieutenant Kenshaw. The left flank deployed 
into line in open order. During this time our artillery began to tell upon the 
enemy, who continued their fire without interruption. The nine-pounders, 
standing in plain view upon the bank, were discharged with such precision 
that it soon became too warm for the enemy to remain upon the brow of their 
heights ; eventually a shot told upon their nine-pounder, knocked the gun from 
its trail, astounding the enemy so much that they left it for four or five minutes. 
Some twenty of them now advanced, and, hastily fastening ropes to it, dragged 
the gun to the rear. Captain Hensley's skirmishers now advanced and took the 
hill upon the right, the left wing of the enemy retreating before them. The six-pounder from the rear had now come up ; Captain Hensley was ordered to sup 
port it, and returned from the hill. This movement being observed, the enemy's 
left made an attempt to charge the two guns ; but the right flank of the marines, 
under Captain Zeilin, being quickly thrown back, showed too steady a front for 
the courage of the Californians to engage, who wheeled to the left and dashed 
to the rear across the river. At this time the enemy were observed collecting 
on our left and making preparations to charge our left flank. <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> 
was now ordered to form a square with the troops on the right flank, upon which 
the left flank, in case of being worsted, might rally. The right wing of the 
enemy now made an unsuccessful attempt to charge our left, but, finding so 
warm a reception from the musketeers of the Savannah and Congress, under 
Lieutenant Renshaw and Acting Master Guest, as also the small party of marines under Lieutenant H. B. Watson, they changed their purpose and retired, 
when a discharge of artillery told upon their ranks. The guard of the day, 
under Midshipman Hay wood, protected the animals in the rear, awaiting with 
patience for the enemy to give them an opportunity to open a fire. 
</p><p>
The dispositions for charging the heights were now made. The troops having 
been brought into line, the command forward being given, on they went, (the 
artillery in battery,) charging the heights, which the enemy's centre contested 
for a few moments, then broke in retreat, their right wing charging upon the 
rear, under <a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a>, encumbered with packs, baggage, horses, and 
cattle ; but, receiving a well-directed fire from the guard, which hurled some of 
them from their saddles, they fled at full speed across the river we had just left. 
The other portion of their forces retreated behind their artillery, which had taken 
position in a ravine, and again opened its fire upon our centre ; our artillery was 
immediately thrown forward, the troops being ordered to lie down to avoid the 
enemy's cannon-balls, which passed directly over their heads. 
</p><p>
The fire from our artillery was incessant, and so accurate that the enemy were from time to time driven from their guns, until they finally retreated. 
</p><p>
We were now in possession of the heights where, a short time before, the insurgents had so vauntingly taken strong position ; and the band, playing 
Hail Columbia! and Yankee Doodle/ announced another glorious victory on the 8th day of January. 
</p><p>
Our loss in this action was ascertained to be two killed and nine wounded. The enemy's loss we could not ascertain with any certainty, as they carried away both killed and wounded upon their horses. 
</p><p>
We moved down the heights until they brought us near the river, where we 
encamped, having our cattle, horses, and mules under the bank, safely protected. Tattoo was beat at an early hour, and the camp retired to rest. At 
about twelve o clock, the picquets having been fired upon, the camp was soon 
under arms in the most perfect order. Finding the enemy made no further demonstration, after remaining under arms a short time, we again sought our 
blankets, and nothing disturbed our repose until the sounding of the reveille on the 9th told us to be stirring. 
</p><p>
At daylight, Captain Zeilin was despatched with a party of thirty marines to a rancho about three-quarters of a mile from camp, to ascertain if there were 
any persons concealed about it, or whether there was any barley or provisions to be found there ; finding none, he returned with his party about sunrise, with out meeting any of the enemy. 
</p><p>
At nine o clock our column commenced its march, taking a direct course over the plain of the Mesa, towards Ciudad de los Angeles. We had advanced some 
six miles when the enemy appeared in front, deployed in open order, their line extending nearly across our road. Approaching a ravine to the left of their line 
in front, the enemy opened a fire from their artillery, masked upon the edge of the bank, but with no other effect than killing an ox and mule in the centre of 
the square. Our artillery soon returned the fire while still continuing the march; the enemy now brought up two other pieces of artillery; our column 
halted ; our artillery on the two flanks in front was now placed in battery. The six-pounder under Acting Master Thompson, upon our right flank in rear, now 
opened its fire upon the enemy's nine-pounder, the shot telling upon it and cutting away the fixtures about the gun at every fire. The enemy in front and upon the right was now distant about six hundred yards ; the nine-pounders, 
one of them in charge of Mr. Southwick, soon made it so warm for their artillery in front that the enemy bore it off to their rear. 
</p><p>
A reinforcement now joined them, and, soon after, down they came upon us, charging upon the left flank, front and rear. A shower of lead from the musketry under Renshaw and Guest, and Passed Midshipman Duncan's carbineers, 
(who had to-day taken post on the left flank,) being well delivered, at a distance of eighty yards, did so much havoc that their courage failed, and caused them 
to draw off more to the rear, which had until this moment stood firm without firing a shot. The four-pounder now poured forth a charge of grape upon a 
party of the enemy about thirty yards distant, hurling four from their saddles, and they again retired. 
</p><p>
The Californians now retreated, and we pursued our march along the Mesa and crossed the Rio San Fernando about three miles below the town, where we encamped for the night. 
</p><p>
During the day we lost but one killed and five wounded, notwithstanding the shot from the enemy, both round and grape, and from the carbines of the horse men, fell thick among our men, who undauntedly pursued their march forward. 
On the 10th our tents were struck at an early hour; but, the morning being cold and the town being distant but three miles, our march was delayed until about ten o clock. 
</p><p>
We entered the City of the Angels, our band playing as we marched up the principal street to the square, our progress being slightly molested by a few drunken fellows who remained about the town. The riflemen, having been 
sent to the heights commanding the town, were soon followed by Lieutenant Tilghman, with two pieces of artillery, supported by the marines under Captain Zeilin, the enemy, in small force, retiring out of sight upon their approach. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a>, having received the order, now hoisted the same flag upon the government-house of the country which he hauled down when he retreated from the city in September last. 
</p><p>
Enclosed I send the report of our killed and wounded. Our loss was three killed and fourteen wounded; that of the enemy between seventy and eighty, besides many horses.

My narrative is done. Our friends and the territory have been rescued. I will only add that we had, of course, to simplify military tactics for our own 
use. We had, therefore, but five orders, viz.: form line, form square, fire, repel charge, charge. The celerity and accuracy with which they could perform 
these evolutions were remarkable, and bade defiance even to the rapid movements of Californian cavalry. 
</p><p>
I have thus truly exhibited to you, sir, sailors, (who were principally armed 
with boarding-pikes, carbines, and pistols, having no more than about two hundred bayonets in the whole division,) victorious over an equal number of the 
best horsemen in the world, well mounted and well armed with carbines and pistols and lances. I have nothing to bestow on these gallant officers and men 
for their heroism except my poor commendation, which I most sincerely give to them, individually and collectively. I must, therefore, recommend them to you 
for the greatest reward a patriot may claim, the approbation of their country. 
</p><p>
Faithfully, your obedient servant,

[REPORT OF COMMODORE STOCKTON OF HIS OPERATIONS ON THE COAST OF THE PACIFIC.] 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city origin'>WASHINGTON</a>, D. C., <a rel="month origin" value="2">February</a> <a rel='day origin' value='18'>18</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1848' rel="origin">1848</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR: On my return from California in November last, the circumstances of the times seemed to present reasons for delaying a full report of my transactions and operations on the coast of the Pacific. 
</p><p>
The authority under which I had acted was questioned or denied; the validity of much that had been done was doubted, and investigations were on foot in 
which the propriety of my proceedings might be brought to the especial notice of the Executive. 
</p><p>
After a full consideration of the circumstances, to which it is unnecessary here further to allude, it appeared to me decorous and respectful to withhold, for 
a brief period, my own views of the questions in which I was to some extent implicated, and to leave the Executive to learn the details of those transactions 
from other quarters. The period, however, has now arrived in which I feel that I can, without the imputation of improper feelings or motives, lay before the 
Executive, in a tangible and official form, a narrative of the occurrences which 
J directed in California; explain the circumstances which induced the course 
which I pursued, the motives by which I was guided, the objects which I designed to accomplish, and thus to put the President in possession of ample 
means to form a judgment upon my conduct. It appears now to be no longer 
questioned that I actually possessed and exercised the powers of governor of 
California and commander-in-chief of the forces of the United States in that 
quarter, and that, whether rightfully or wrongfully, I executed the duties and 
administered the functions appertaining to these high offices, for the administration of which I am alone responsible. The despatches which were from time 
to time addressed to the Department were designed to furnish the government 
with accurate information of what transpired ; but, under the circumstances in 
which they were prepared, it did not enter into my purpose to give a general 
narrative of the entire operations. Opening a full view of the circumstances 
which influenced my judgment in selecting the course which was adopted, and 
the policy by which that course was determined, with your permission I beg 
leave, at this time, to perform this duty; the obligations to do which, at this 
juncture, seem to me more imperative, since it appears that in an official communication addressed to the Department by my successor in command, I am in 
the most explicit terms censured for premature as well as injudicious action. 
With what of propriety or of professional courtesy this condemnation has been 
passed by an officer of equal rank with myself, without any report or communication to him of what had occurred, or the reasons by which I was governed, 
is not so apparent. Under the instructions from the Department, I arrived, in 
command of the United States frigate Congress, at the harbour of Monterey, 
about the middle of July, <a href='/results.php?year=1846'>1846</a>. The American flag was there flying. I immediately went on board the United States frigate Savannah, then lying off that 
town, and, in conformity with my orders, I reported myself to <a href='/results.php?tla=jds' rel='co-worker'>Commodore Sloat</a> 
as forming part of the squadron then under his command. From him I learned 
that in the preceding month of June, while lying off Mazatlan, he had received 
intelligence that war had commenced between the United States and Mexico; 
that he had forthwith proceeded to Monterey, landed a force, and hoisted the 
flag of the United States without resistance. In the course of our interview, 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jds' rel='co-worker'>Commodore Sloat</a> apprised me of his intention to return in a short time to the 
United States, whereby the command of the squadron would devolve upon me. 
In this position it became my duty to examine into the state of affairs, and, in 
view of the responsibility which was about to rest upon me, to obtain all the 
information which would enable me to exercise a proper judgment as to the 
ulterior measures to be pursued. The result of my inquiries and investigations 
showed me that the position I was about to occupy was an important and 
critical one. The intelligence of the commencement of hostilities between the 
two nations, although it had passed through Mexico, had reached <a href='/results.php?tla=jds' rel='co-worker'>Commodore Sloat</a> in advance of the Mexican authorities. When he made his first hostile 
demonstrations, therefore, the enemy, ignorant of the existence of the war, had 
regarded his acts as an unwarrantable exercise of power by the United States, 
and the most lively indignation and bitter resentment pervaded the country. 
</p><p>
The public functionaries of the territory were not slow in availing themselves of this feeling, and endeavoured to stimulate it to the highest possible degree. 
A proclamation was put forth, denouncing in the most unmeasured terms all foreigners; but it was unquestionably aimed principally at the citizens of the United States, and such others as sympathized with them. Two or three were, 
in fact, murdered, and all were led to apprehend extermination from the sanguinary feeling of resentment which was everywhere breathed. 
</p><p>
The local legislature was in session. Governor Pio Pico had assembled a force of about seven hundred or one thousand men, supplied with seven pieces 
of artillery, breathing vengeance against the perpetrators of the insult and injury which they supposed to have been inflicted. These hostile demonstrations were daily increasing, and, by the time that the command devolved on me 
by the departure of <a href='/results.php?tla=jds' rel='co-worker'>Commodore Sloat</a>, the situation of things had assumed a critical and alarming appearance. Every citizen and friend of the United States 
throughout the territory was in imminent jeopardy; he could count upon no security for either property or life. It was well known that numerous emigrants 
from the United States were on their way to Upper California. These, marching in small and detached parties, encumbered with their wives and children 
and baggage, uninformed of the war and consequently unprepared for attack, would have been exposed to certain destruction. 
</p><p>
It was also ascertained that, in the anticipation of the eventful conquest of the country by the United States, many of those in the actual possession of 
authority were preparing for this change by disposing of the public property, so that it might be found in private hands when the Americans should acquire 
possession, believing that private rights would be protected and individual property secure. Negotiations were in actual progress thus to acquire three 
thousand leagues of land, and to dispose of all the most valuable portions of the territory appertaining to the missions at nominal prices, so that the conquerors should find the entire country appropriated to individuals, and in hands which could effectually prevent sales to American citizens, and thus check the tide of emigration, while little or no benefit would result to the nation from the 
acquisition of this valuable territory. 
</p><p>
All these considerations, together with others of inferior moment, seemed to make prompt and decisive action an imperative duty. To retain possession 
merely of a few seaports, while cut off from all intercourse with the interior, exposed to constant attack by the concentrated forces of an exasperated enemy, 
appeared wholly useless. Yet to abandon ground which we had occupied, to withdraw our forces from these points, to yield places where our flag had been 
floating in triumph, was an alternative not to be thought of, except as a last resource. Not only would all the advantages which had been obtained be thus 
abandoned, and perhaps never be regained without great expenditure of blood and treasure, but the pride and confidence of the enemy would be increased to 
a dangerous extent by such indications of our weakness and inability to maintain what we had won. 
</p><p>
Previous to the departure of <a href='/results.php?tla=jds' rel='co-worker'>Commodore Sloat</a>, he had, at my instance, and upon my representations, placed at my disposal the United States sloop-of-war 
Cyane, as well as the forces on shore. I immediately apprised <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Captain Fremont</a>, then of the topographical corps, with whom I had previous communications, of 
the position in which I was placed, and that I had determined upon my plan of operations. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Captain Fremont</a> and Lieutenant Gillespie, of the marine corps, had already raised a body of 100 volunteers, prepared to act according to circumstances. 
I informed those gentlemen that if they, together with the men whom they had raised, would volunteer to serve under my command so long as I should remain 
in California and require their services, that I would form them into a battalion, appointing the former major and the latter captain. These arrangements were 
all completed in the course of the 23d of July, and my letters of that date to <a href='/results.php?tla=jds' rel='co-worker'>Commodore Sloat</a>, to Commander Du Pont, and <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Captain Fremont</a>, on file in the Department, will have apprised you of my movements. 
</p><p>
It was thus that the battalion of California volunteers was organized, which subsequently, under its gallant officers, took so patriotic and efficient a part in 
the military operations in that territory. It was received into the service of the United States to aid the navy, as essential as well to the maintenance of the 
position we then occupied as to execute the plans which I had contemplated in the interior. 
</p><p>
A few days subsequently, <a href='/results.php?tla=jds' rel='co-worker'>Commodore Sloat</a> sailed in the Levant, thus devolving upon me the command of the entire force, both afloat and on shore. 
That force then consisted of the frigates Congress and Savannah, sloops-of-war Portsmouth, Cyane, and Warren, and the store-ship Erie. The Portsmouth was 
at San Francisco, the Congress and Savannah at Monterey, the Cyane had been sent with the California battalion to San Diego, the Warren was at Mazatlan, 
and the Erie at the Sandwich Islands. The force to be employed on land consisted of 50O men, furnished from the Congress, provided with about 00 muskets 
and bayonets, some small cannon procured from the merchant-vessels, and the battalion of volunteers, all indifferently provided with the appendages of an army. 
</p><p>
Leaving the Savannah at Monterey, for its protection,. I sailed about the first of August, in the Congress, for San Pedro. This town is situated about 28 
miles from Ciudad de los Angeles, in the vicinity of which the enemy was stated to be. On the way to San Pedro, we landed at Santa Barbara, of which 
we took possession, and, leaving a small force for its defence, proceeded to San Pedro, where we arrived on the 6th of August. Here information was received 
of the arrival of the Cyane at San Diego, of the landing of the battalion, and that <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Major Fremont</a> had experienced great difficulty in procuring the necessary 
supply of horses. We immediately commenced the landing of our forces from the frigate. On the following day two persons arrived representing themselves 
to be commissioners sent from <a href='/results.php?tla=jsc' rel='adversary'>General Castro</a>, authorized to enter into negotiations with me, and bearing a letter from the General, which is already in possession of the Department. Before, however, they would communicate the extent of their power or the nature of their instructions, they made a preliminary demand that the further march of the troops must be arrested, and that I must 
not advance beyond the position which I then occupied. This proposition was peremptorily declined. I announced my determination to advance; and the 
commissioners returned to their camp without imparting further the objects of the proposed negotiations. Independently of the character of the preliminary 
conditions insisted upon by these commissioners, various considerations induced me to be averse to any negotiations in the existing state of affairs, and to press 
forward for the purpose of dispersing the forces which had been collected to oppose my progress. Some of these considerations I feel it my duty to submit 
to your notice, that my objects and designs may be properly appreciated by the 
government. From the brief period which had intervened since the commencement of hostilities, it was obvious that the central government in Mexico could 
not have been apprised of the existing state of affairs; and, therefore, could 
not have communicated to this remote quarter orders and instructions accommodated to these circumstances. The local functionaries, therefore, who pro 
posed to negotiate with me, must have acted upon their own authority, and 
their proceedings with a foreign power must depend for their validity upon the 
subsequent ratification and approval by the general government. Such ratification, it was confidently believed, would be given or withheld, according as the 
exigencies of the times made advisable. Any arrangements, therefore, by which the further progress of the American arms would be stayed, would have 
left all the advantages to the one party. It was further manifest that the single act of entering into negotiations with this local authority would have been a 
recognition of its power to act definitively upon other subjects. If it could treat with us, a foreign foe, it would be impossible to deny its authority in matters 
more obviously within its sphere of action. The transfer of the public domain and property could scarcely have been questioned by us; and, as was well 
understood, arrangements were in progress to transfer all of it that was valuable to private hands, bitterly inimical to the United States and its interests. To 
prevent the accomplishment of this design was one of the chief objects which had been contemplated from the organization and march of the forces under 
my command; to enter into negotiations without the entire dispersement of the local government, and of the troops which it had assembled for its defence, 
would have been absolutely to relinquish this highly important design. In 
addition to this, preservation of American interests, and of the lives and property of our citizens already in California and on their way to this territory, 
imperatively demanded that the troops which had been assembled under <a href='/results.php?tla=jsc' rel='adversary'>General Castro</a> should be_defeated or dispersed. The condition insisted upon as a preliminary clearly indicated that no arrangement would be acceded to which did 
not leave the Mexicans in the full possession of power throughout the province ; and, if left in this possession, relieved from all apprehensions of molestation on 
our side, they would have been enabled to direct all their energies and force to the accomplishment of other objects. 
</p><p>
The extermination of the Americans, which had been threatened in the proclamation already referred to, was too much in accordance with the feelings 
which pervaded the country and with the policy which governed its rulers not to have been the immediate and certain result of any opening of negotiations be 
gun under such inauspicious signs as were insisted upon as preliminary conditions. Every evil consequence which I had apprehended would result from 
leaving things as they were found on my arrival in California was still to be feared ; and even the movements which had already been made, unless pressed 
to a successful close, would have tended only to aggravate and precipitate them. There was, further, every reason to believe that the principal, if not the only, 
object which the Mexicans were sincerely desirous to obtain, was to gain time ; 
and this would have been accomplished with entire certainty by the mere commencement of negotiations and the arrest of our advance, without reference to its final termination. 
</p><p>
Our march would necessarily have been suspended at the outset ; the sailors and marines must have re-embarked ; the California battalion, so prompt and 
energetic in volunteering to aid us, must have been abandoned to its own resources, and, thus insulated and unsupported, must either have dispersed or 
fallen a sacrifice to an exasperated and powerful enemy. In the meanwhile, the Mexican General, relieved from all danger of disturbance from us, might, and 
certainly would, have increased his numerical force, augmented still more its efficiency, until he had acquired the capacity of expelling us from the places which had submitted to our arms. 
</p><p>
The foregoing were among the prominent reasons which determined me to reject the Mexican proffers of negotiation, and I trust they are such as recommend my proceedings to the favourable consideration and approval of the President. 
</p><p>
The commissioners were dismissed to their own camp, with an intimation that I should immediately follow them, and that the result of a battle would speedily 
determine whether <a href='/results.php?tla=jsc' rel='adversary'>General Castro</a> and Governor Pio Pico, or myself, were to exercise authority over the inhabitants and territory of California. 
</p><p>
Two or three days afterwards, other persons arrived from the camp of <a href='/results.php?tla=jsc' rel='adversary'>General Castro</a>, with a communication from that functionary, stating his determination 
to defend the country to the last extremity, and indulging in the most extrava gant language. 
</p><p>
Having completed all the arrangements which time and circumstances permitted, and despatched a courier to <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Major Fremont</a>, apprising him of my movements, we commenced our march towards the camp of the enemy on the 11th of 
August. In the course of the afternoon of that day information reached us that the enemy's force, instead of awaiting our approach, had dispersed ; that they 
had buried their guns, and that the governor and general had retreated, as was supposed, towards Sonora. We continued our march towards Ciudad de los Angeles, and on the 13th, having been joined by <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Major Fremont</a> with about 120 volunteers under his command, we marched into the city, which we quietly occupied. 
</p><p>
Alter the dispersement of the army of the enemy, the flight of the general and governor-in-chief out of the territory, a number of the officers of the Mexican 
army were captured and made prisoners of war. Among these were Jose Maria Flores, whose name will hereafter appear prominently, and Don Andres Pico, 
brother of Governor Pio Pico. These officers Avere released upon their parole of honour not to bear arms against the United States pending the war, unless 
exchanged ; with what of fidelity they performed this obligation will appear in the sequel. The people in general came in, tendered their submission to our 
authority, and promised allegiance to our government. Every indication of a hostile force had now disappeared from the country, tranquillity was restored,, 
and I forthwith determined to organize a temporary civil government to conduct 
public affairs and to administer justice as in time of peace. Various considerations prompted to this course. It appeared to me that the existence of such a 
government, under the authority of the United States, would leave no pretence upon which it might be urged that the conquest of the country had not been 
accomplished. While merely the military power exercised power, enforcing its authority by martial law and executing its functions through the instrumentality of a regular military force, nothing could be regarded as settled, 
and opposition to its power would be considered as a lawful opposition 
to a foreign enemy. When, however, the whole frame of civil administration should be organized, courts and judges performing their accustomed 
functions public taxes and imposts regularly collected and appropriated to the 
ordinary objects and purposes of government, any opposition might be justly 
deemed a civil offence, and the appropriate punishment inflicted in the ordinary course of administering justice. 
</p><p>
Indeed, the law military appeared to me wholly inadequate to the emergency. 
It could not reach many of the objects over which a salutary control ought to be 
exercised. It could riot effectively administer the property or sufficiently guard 
private rights. A civil government which should, through its various functionaries, pervade the entire country, exercise a superintendence over all the in 
habitants, discover, restrain, and punish all acts of insubordination, detect and 
check all attempts at a hostile organization, recognise and sanction the possession, use, and transfer of property, inflict upon criminals the appropriate 
punishment, and remedy injuries inflicted upon individuals, seemed not only an important instrument in the accomplishment of the objects which I had in 
view, but essential to the attainment of the ends of the government. It appeared 
to me desirable that the actual possession and exercise of power should be transferred, with the least possible delay, from the military to civil functionaries. 
</p><p>
Under our institutions the military is regarded as inferior to the civil authority, and the appropriate duty of the former is to act as auxiliary to the latter. 
Such being the general character of our institutions, it seemed in the first degree desirable that the inhabitants of the country should, as soon as practicable, 
become familiar with them, that they might perceive and appreciate their importance and their value, their capacity to maintain right and redress wrong, 
and, in the protection afforded to persons and property, to recognise a guarantee of all their individual rights. The marked contrast which would thus be afforded 
to their former institutions and rulers would reconcile the Mexican portion of the population to the change ; while the American inhabitants would gratefully 
witness an administration of law and justice analogous to that to which they had been accustomed at home. Actuated by such considerations, I gave my 
immediate attention to the establishment, upon a permanent basis, of a civil government throughout the country, as much in conformity with the former 
usages of the country as could be done in the absence of any written code. A tariff of duties was fixed, and collectors appointed. Elections were directed to 
be held for the various civil magistrates ; <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Major Fremont</a> was appointed military commandant of the territory, and <a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a> military commandant 
of the southern department. The battalion of volunteers was ordered to be augmented to three hundred ; and, contemplating soon to leave the territory, I 
determined on my departure to appoint <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Major Fremont</a> Governor of California. He was apprised of these intended arrangements, and instructed to meet me at 
San Francisco on the 25th of October, for the purpose of consummating them. These acts and intentions were officially communicated to the Department in my several despatches. 
</p><p>
This exposition of my operations and acts will, I trust, prove satisfactory to 
the executive, and be a sufficient reply to Commodore Shubrick's charge of premature action. In a state of actual war against a foreign enemy, I found my 
self at the head of a force and in command of means competent to take and hold 
possession of an important part of the hostile territory. I found that before the 
command had devolved upon me the flag of my country had been raised in 
some parts of California. Important interests were involved ; to stop short 
would have led to their absolute sacrifice, accompanied by great individual loss 
and suffering. No middle course was open to my choice. The alternative was 
the subjection of the entire province to our authority, or its total abandonment. 
In such a position I could not hesitate as to the line of duty. Empowered to 
conduct the war against Mexico according to the exigency of circumstances and my own judgment, I determined to support the honour of my flag and to pro 
mote what I regarded as the best interest of the nation. Having achieved the 
conquest of the country, and finding my military strength ample to retain it, 
the establishment of a civil government naturally and necessarily resulted. The 
omission to do this would have marred the entire plan and stamped a character 
of imbecility and instability upon the whole operation. My views of the interests of my country were decisive ; as to the expediency of my measures, the 
estimate I entertained of my authority impressed upon them the sanction of 
duty. The arrangements having been thus completed, I determined to leave 
California under the administration of the civil authority, and with the squadron 
under my command, aided by a volunteer corps raised for the purpose, to sail 
for the southern part of Mexico, capture Acapulco, and, having secured proper 
positions on the coast, to march into the interior, advance towards the city of 
Mexico, and thus to co-operate with the anticipated movements of <a href='/results.php?tla=zat' rel='colleague'>General Taylor</a>, 
or produce a powerful diversion which would materially aid him in his operations. My despatches have already put the department in possession of these plans. 
</p><p>
About the 2d of September I left Ciudad de los Angeles, embarked on board 
the Congress on the 3d, and on the 5th sailed for Santa Barbara. Having 
taken on board the small detachment which had been landed at this place, we 
proceeded to Monterey, where every thing was found tranquil. The people appeared to be quite satisfied with the state of affairs. Information was here received leading to the apprehension that Suter's settlement on the Sacramento 
was threatened with an attack by a body of one thousand Walla-Walla Indians. 
The Savannah was immediately ordered to San Francisco; Lieutenant Maddox, 
of the marine corps, appointed military commandant of the middle department, 
and, other necessary arrangements having been made, I proceeded in the Congress to San Francisco, which place I reached in a few days. It soon appeared 
that the reports in regard to the Walla-Walla Indians had been greatly exaggerated. They were not so numerous as had been represented, nor had they any 
hostile intentions. The inhabitants of San Francisco, on my arrival, received me en masse, with every demonstration of joy on the conquest of the country, 
and with every manifestation of personal respect as the governor of the territory and commander-in-chief of the United States forces. 
</p><p>
About the 30th of September, a courier arrived from <a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a>, despatched by that officer to convey to me the information that an insurrection 
had broken out at Ciudad de los Angeles, and that he was besieged in the 
government-house at that place by a large force. I immediately ordered Captain Mervine to proceed in the Savannah to San Pedro, for the purpose of affording aid to <a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a>. <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Major Fremont</a> was at Sacramento when the 
news of the insurrection reached him, and, having formed the determination to march against the insurgents with the force he could muster, amounting to 
about one hundred and twenty men, was preparing to move. I sent a request 
to him forthwith to join me at San Francisco with his command, and to bring 
with him as many saddles as he could procure. While awaiting the arrival of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Major Fremont</a> I detached officers in various directions for the purpose of pro 
curing volunteers to join the battalion, and engaged the merchant-ship Sterling to take them down to Santa Barbara. 
</p><p>
About the 12th of October, <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Major Fremont</a> arrived at San Francisco, and immediately embarked on board the Sterling, with about one hundred and sixty 
volunteers. He was directed to proceed to Santa Barbara, there to procure horses to march to Ciudad de los Angeles, while I, with the Congress, was to 
sail to San Pedro, and by that route advance towards the same point. The insurgents were represented to be encamped in the neighbourhood of that city. 
The Congress and Sterling sailed in company from San Francisco, but separated the same evening in a fog. Between San Francisco and Monterey we 
spoke a merchant-vessel from the latter port, with despatches from Lieutenant Maddox, apprising me that Monterey was threatened with an attack, and that 
he was in want of immediate assistance. We ran into the Bay of Monterey, landed two officers with fifty men and some ordnance. Having thus strengthened that post, I proceeded to San Pedro. On my arrival at that place, about 
the 23d of October, I found the Savannah frigate. Captain Mervine informed me that <a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a>, with the volunteers under his command, was on 
board his vessel, having left Ciudad de los Angeles under a capitulation entered into with General Flores, the leader of the insurrection, one of the Mexican 
officers who, having been made prisoner of war, had been released on his parole. 
</p><p>
Captain Mervine further informed me that, about two weeks before, he had landed with his sailors and marines for the purpose of marching in conjunction 
with <a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a> and his detachment of volunteers to Ciudad de los Angeles. He had not carried any artillery with him ; that about twelve miles 
from San Pedro he encountered a party of the insurgents with one piece of 
artillery ; a battle ensued ; that several charges had been made upon the insurgents gun, but it was impossible to capture it, as, whenever he approached, 
they hitched their horses to it and retreated. Having sustained a loss of several men killed and wounded, he retired with his force and re-embarked. 
</p><p>
Proper arrangements having been made during the night, in the morning we landed a strong force with several pieces of artillery, once more hoisted the flag 
of the United States at San Pedro, and formed our camp there. The insurgent force in the vicinity w r as supposed to number about eight hundred men. Our 
authority was necessarily limited to the portion of territory in our actual possession or within the range of our guns. The insurgents, in the undisturbed 
occupancy of the interior, and watchful of our every movement, could, at their pleasure, threaten us with an attack by night or day, and had the precaution to 
remove beyond our reach every horse and all the cattle which might have been available either for food or transportation. 
</p><p>
The roadstead at San Pedro was also a dangerous position for men-of-war, being exposed to the storms which at that season of the year rage with great violence upon the coast. 
</p><p>
This consideration decided me to proceed to San Diego, which, although the entrance was obstructed by a bar which had never been passed by a vessel of 
equal draught of water with the Congress, might, I hoped, be crossed ; and, if the passage should prove practicable, would be found a convenient and safe 
harbour. We did not, however, leave San Pedro until I had been compelled to relinquish all expectation of the co-operation of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Major Fremont</a>, from whom I 
had not heard a word since we parted off San Francisco, nor until the officers and men had become completely exhausted by their incessant duties on shore, 
in guarding the camp from attack and pursuing small parties of the insurgents who approached us. Having embarked the men belonging to the v squadron, 
and volunteers under <a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a>, I sailed for San Diego in the Congress. 
</p><p>
On my arrival off the harbour of San Diego, I received information from Lieutenant Minor that the town was besieged by the insurgents, that his stock of 
provisions was small, and that he was in w r ant of an additional force. He gave it as his opinion that the Congress might be got over the bar. In attempting 
this, however, the ship struck, and her position was so dangerous that we were compelled to return to the anchorage outside. 
</p><p>
On the following day the Malek Adhel, a prize to the United States ship Warren, arrived from Monterey with despatches from <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont</a>. I thus received information from that officer that on his way to Santa Barbara he met the merchant-ship Vandalia, from San Pedro, by whom he was 
informed of the state of affairs at the South; that it would be impossible for him to procure horses at Santa Barbara, in consequence of which he had proceeded 
to Monterey, and would employ all diligence in preparing his force to march for Ciudad de los Angeles. 
</p><p>
Lieutenant Minor was directed to send the ship Stonington, then lying in the harbour of San Diego, with as many volunteers as could be spared, to Ensanada, 
about ninety miles below San Diego, for the purpose of procuring animals, which he was instructed to have driven into San Diego. Without a supply of 
horses and beeves, it was not prudent to commence our march. Captain Mervine was despatched in the Savannah to Monterey, to aid <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont</a> in his preparations to march, and, having myself gone to San Pedro, 
returned with all convenient speed to San Diego. 
</p><p>
About thirty or forty miles from that place our progress was arrested by a calm. My anxiety on account of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont</a>, and my desire 
to go to his assistance was so great, that a boat was immediately despatched with Lieutenant Tilghman, the bearer of a communication addressed to Lieutenant George Minor, in command at San Diego, apprising that officer that on 
my arrival 1 would be ready to take the field in person, and, with an additional force of two hundred and fifty men from the ship, to take up the line of march 
for Ciudad do los Angeles. Lieutenant Minor was directed to arrange with 
Lieutenant Tilghman, the commanding officer of the artillery, and Mr. Southwick, commanding officer of the engineers, to have the horses necessary for the transportation of the guns and ammunition. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding my first unsuccessful attempt to get into the harbour of San Diego, it was an object of too great importance to he abanrlnnprl, unless from 
the absolute impossibility of effecting it. The bar and channel were again, on my return, examined and buoy fid, and a second attempt made. After crossing 
the bar, the ship grounded, and in such a situation that it became expedient to prepare her spars to shore her up, to prevent her from tumbling over. While thus occupied, the insurgents commenced an attack upon the town, and, not 
withstanding the perilous condition of the frigate and the necessity of employing the crew in extricating her from her position, a portion of them was simultaneously engaged in landing from the ship, in boats, to take part in the fight. 
In executing my orders in reference to those two distinct objects at the same time, the conduct of the officers and men under my command was such as to 
command my warmest commendation. Every thing was performed with the regularity and order of the ordinary duties of the vessel. Having accomplished 
a landing of the men from the ship, the attack of the insurgents was successfully repelled by the combined force under the command of Lieutenant Minor and <a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a>. 
</p><p>
The situation of the place was found to be most miserable and deplorable. The male inhabitants had abandoned the town, leaving their women and children dependent upon us for protection and food. No horses could be obtained 
to assist in the transportation of the guns and ammunition, and not a beeve could be had to supply the necessary food ; some supplies of provisions were 
furnished from the ship. The expedition to the southward for animals, under the command of Captain Gibson, of the battalion, had succeeded in driving 
about ninety horses and two hundred head of beef-cattle into the garrison. 
</p><p>
The horses were, however, much worn down, and it was supposed a fort night's rest would be required before they would be fit for service. During the 
time required for resting the horses, we were actively employed in the construction of a fort, for the more complete protection of the town, mounting guns, and 
in making the necessary harness, saddles, and bridles. While the work of preparation necessary for our march to meet <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont</a> at Ciudad de los Angeles was thus going on, we sent an Indian to ascertain where the 
principal force of the insurgents was encamped. He returned with information that a body of them, about fifty strong, was encamped at San Bernardo, about 
thirty miles from San Diego. <a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a> was immediately ordered to have as many men as he could mount, with a piece of artillery, ready to march 
for the purpose of surprising the insurgents in their camp. Another expedition, under command of Captain Hensley, of the battalion, was sent to the 
southward for animals, who, after performing the most arduous service, returned with five hundred head of cattle and one hundred and forty horses and 
mules. About the 3d of December, two deserters from the insurgents, whose families lived in San Diego, came into the place and reported themselves to 
Lieutenant Minor, the commander of the troops. On receiving information of 
the fact, I repaired to Lieutenant Minor's quarters, with my aid-de-camp, Lieutenant Gray, for the purpose of examining one of these men. While engaged 
in this examination, a messenger arrived with a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, 
of the United States army, apprising me of his approach, and expressing a wish that I -would open a communication with him and inform him of the state of affairs in California. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a> was immediately ordered to proceed to <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>'s camp with the force which he had been directed to have in readiness, carrying 
a letter which I wrote to <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>. <a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a> left San Diego at about half-past seven o clock the same evening, taking with him one of the deserters to act as a guide in conducting <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> to the camp of the insurgents. The force which accompanied <a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a> consisted of a company of volunteers, composed of Acting Lieutenant Beale, Passed Midshipman 
Duncan, ten carbineers from the Congress, Captain Gibson, and twenty-five of the California battalion. Mr. Stokes, who was the bearer of the letter from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, was also of the company. In the evening of December 6, Mr. Stokes returned to San Diego, to inform me that <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, on the 
morning of that day, had attempted to surprise the insurgents, under the command of Captain Andres Pipo, in their camp at San Pnsqnal ; that he had been 
worsted in the action which ensued, but to what extent he was unable to say, as he had left the field before the battle was concluded. He, however, was 
under the impression that <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> had lost a number of men killed and wounded. 
</p><p>
The following morning, Lieutenant Godey, of the California battalion, with two men, came into San Diego with a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=hst' rel='colleague met'>Captain Turner</a>, of the dragoons, informing me that <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> had had a fight with a considerable 
body of the Mexicans ; that he had about eighteen killed and fourteen or fifteen wounded, and suggesting the propriety of despatching, without delay, a considerable force to his assistance. Preparations were immediately made to despatch a detachment for this purpose. <a href='/results.php?tla=hst' rel='colleague met'>Captain Turner</a> had not mentioned the 
strength on either side, and Lieutenant Godey was not able to inform me. From the information, however, I deemed it advisable to proceed in person, with all 
the force that could be spared from the garrison, to form a junction with him. Two days provisions were ordered to be prepared, and the advance, with two 
field-pieces, under Acting Lieutenant Guest, was directed to march forthwith to the mission of San Diego, where it was my intention to join it with the rest 
of the force the next morning. Before, however, the advance had moved, an Indian came in from <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>. From the information he gave, I judged 
that the necessity for immediate assistance was much more urgent than had been previously supposed. Anticipating great difficulty and delay from the 
want of animals to drag the artillery, should I march with my entire force, and believing, from the representations now made, that the force of the Californians 
was less than had been supposed, and consequently that a portion of my command would be sufficient for the purpose, I determined not to move in person, 
but to send on as rapidly as possible an effective body of men. About ten o clock at night, Acting Lieutenant Beale, of the Congress, arrived from <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>'s camp, and confirmed the worst accounts we had received and the importance of prompt assistance. The advanced body, increased to the number 
of 215 men, was placed under the command of Lieutenant Gray, my aid-de camp, with orders to proceed directly to the camp of <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>. The 
order was successfully performed, and Lieutenant Gray, having accomplished it, returned to San Diego accompanied by the General. On their arrival, <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, his officers and men, were received by all the garrison in the kindest 
and most respectful manner. So far as my observation extended, no civility or attention was omitted. Having sent with <a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a> every horse that 
was fit for use to <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, I was without one for my own accommodation. I was therefore compelled, on foot, to advance and -receive the General, 
whom I conducted to my own quarters, until others more agreeable to him could 
be prepared. The arrival of <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> was to me a source of gratification, although it was my decided opinion which as yet I have seen no reason 
to change that, under the circumstances that existed, I was entitled to retain the position in which I was placed of commander-in-chief ; yet, in consideration 
of his high standing in the army, his long experience as a soldier, the importance of military science and skill in the movements that were to be made in the 
interior of the country, I immediately determined to yield all personal feelings of ambition and to place in his hands the supreme authority. In accordance 
with this determination I tendered to <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> the position of commander-in-chief and offered to accompany him as his aid. 
</p><p>
This proposition was on more than one occasion renewed, and with all sincerity and singleness of purpose. The responsibility of moving from San Diego, 
and leaving the safety of the ships, deprived of so large and efficient a portion of their crews, was of itself a momentous one. This, however, in the discharge 
of duty, I felt no inclination to shrink from. But the fate of the territory itself might depend upon the issue of a battle to be fought on shore against an army 
organized to encounter us. The nature of the service and the importance of the stake, it seemed to me, appertained rather to a general in the army than a captain in the navy. Whatever ambition I might feel for distinction, either on my 
account or on that of the gallant officers and men under my command, was 
voluntarily and deliberately offered as a sacrifice to a paramount sense of duty. The offers thus made were, however, on every occasion distinctly and 
positively declined by <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, who, on his side, offered to accompany me in the capacity of my aid, and tendered to afford me the aid of his head and hand. 
</p><p>
A day or two after his arrival at San Diego, <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> removed from my quarters to others which at his instance had been provided for his accommodation. Before leaving, however, he handed me his instructions from the War 
Department. On reading them, I came to the conclusion that he had submitted them to my perusal to afford me the gratification of perceiving how entirely I 
had anticipated the views of the government in the measures which I had adopted. In return, I exhibited some of my own despatches to the Department. 
Subsequently, and before leaving San Diego, <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> mentioned the subject of his instructions from the War Department, and seemed to intimate 
that he ought of right to be the governor of the territory. His language, how ever, though perhaps sufficiently explicit, was not very intelligible to me, as I 
was at a loss to reconcile the assertion of such a claim of right with his repeated refusal to accept the offer, which I had more than once made to him, to devolve 
upon him the supreme command in the territory. The subject, however, was discussed between us without any interruption of that harmony which had commenced on our first interview. 
</p><p>
A few days before I expected to take up the line of march, I addressed a note 
to the General, expressing a wish that he would accompany me. In his reply 
he repeated the language which he had before employed : that he would so accompany me, and afford me the aid of his head and hand. Accordingly, on the 
morning of our departure he appeared upon the ground. After the troops had been paraded, and were nearly ready to commence the march, as I was about 
to mount my horse, <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> approached me and inquired who was to command the troops. I replied, Lieutenant Rowan was to have the command. 
On his expressing a wish that he should himself command them, I replied, that he should have the command. The different officers were at once convened, 
and informed that <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> had volunteered to command the troops, and that I had given him the appointment, reserving my own position as commander-in-chief. This arrangement having been made, we proceeded on the march. 
</p><p>
During our march I was informed by <a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a>, who was sent by <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, who was in the advance, that two commissioners had arrived with 
a flag and a communication addressed to me. Repairing to the front, I received the commissioners, who bore a letter, signed by General Flores as governor and commander-m-chief, addressed to the commander-in-chief of the American 
forces. Upon reading it, and ascertaining from whom it emanated, I replied to the commissioners, substantially, that I perceived the letter was written by 
General Flores, whom I had captured and held as a prisoner, but whom I had released on his parole of honour ; that in appearing now in hostile array he had 
violated his parole, and could not be treated as an honourable man ; that I had no answer to return to his communication but this : that if I caught him I should shoot him. With this reply the commissioners departed, and we proceeded on our march to meet the enemy. 
</p><p>
The battles on the Rio San Gabriel and on the plains of the Mesa took place on the 8th and 9th of January, <a href='/results.php?year=1847'>1847</a>. On the morning of the 8th, we crossed 
the river under a galling fire from the enemy, who were posted, with their artillery, on the opposite bank, about fifty feet above the level of the river. Having 
crossed the guns, we placed the two nine-pounders in battery, and commenced the fire. As soon as the troops had passed the river, they commenced forming 
the squares. At this time I perceived the insurgents were about to make a charge upon our left flank, and I ordered the men of that flank to be kept in 
line, that we might have a more extended line of fire. At this time, observing that the insurgents had withdrawn their artillery from the hill, I sent Lieutenant 
Gray, my aid-de-camp, to <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, to move the square, with one fieldpiece, up the hill. At this moment the insurgents charged the left flank, but 
were received with such a shower of lead that they were soon repulsed. We immediately moved the line up the hill with the two nine-pounders, which I 
placed in battery in advance of the troops. I ordered the troops to lie down to avoid the insurgents cannon-balls, as the fight was kept up by the artillery alone. 
</p><p>
On the morning of the day we marched into Ciudad de los Angeles, <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> came to me with Mr. Southwick, who was acting as engineer, to ascertain from me by what road I intended to enter the city. He requested Mr. Southwick to mark on the sand the position of the city, and the different roads leading into it. I selected the plainest and broadest road, leading into the 
main street of the city ; and when we marched into the city I led the way with the advance-guard. My position as commander-in-chief was again distinctly recognised in a letter of January 13, addressed to me by <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, as 
Governor of California, commanding United States forces. 
</p><p>
A few days after we had taken Ciudad de los Angeles, <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont</a> arrived with his part of the battalion. 
</p><p>
With the firm convictions which existed upon my mind as to my rights and authority as commander-in-chief, and the obligations which all officers and men 
under my command were under to obey implicitly all my orders, I should not only have felt it to be my right, but a matter of imperative duty, to assert and 
maintain my authority, if necessary, by a resort to force. I continued this exercise of the power of commander-in-chief without its having been denied or questioned by any person, as far as I was informed, up to the 16th of January, when 
I received a letter of that date from <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, which is now on file in the Department, in which he demands that I will cease all further proceedings 
relating to the formation of a civil government; for the territory. In my reply of the same date to that letter, (which, I think, is also on file in the Department,) 
I suspended <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> from his volunteer command under me, when he again became Brigadier-<a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, over whom I never attempted or desired to have any command or control. 
</p><p>
I exercised no authority in the territory after I left San Diego, except that which was induced by the receipt of a letter from Lieutenant-Colonel Cook, in 
forming me that he had received information that a French schooner had been landing some guns on the Southern coast, and that General Bustamente, with 
1500 Mexicans, was approaching the territory. I wrote to Lieutenant-Colonel Cook that I would go in search of them as soon as possible. I went down the 
coast 120 miles, landed and mounted some of my men, and went in pursuit. It turned out to be a false alarm. After performing this last service in California, 
I returned, via San Diego and Monterey, to San Francisco, where I gave up the command of the frigate Congress, and returned to the United States by way of the Rocky Mountains. 
</p><p>
The California battalion was organized under my own personal direction and authority, under a special condition that it should act under my orders as long 
as I might remain in California and require its services. It was paid by my orders, as long as I had any thing to pay with. The officers derived their appointments exclusively from me. It was never, in any form or manner, mustered into the service of the United States as a part of the army or connected 
with it. It was exclusively and essentially a navy organization. The battalion was entirely composed of volunteers, organized under my authority, but with 
their own free consent, according to the terms of a distinct and specific agreement to obey my orders and to serve while I should require their services. 
These men were not of that kind of personnel which sometimes compose regular armies : they were principally free American citizens who had settled in California ; they were men of respectability, of influence, and of property ; they 
were no ordinary men, because, when told that I had offered them as pay ten dollars a month, they said that they would not accept that pay, that it would 
not pay their expenses, but that they would volunteer to serve under my command without compensation. 
</p><p>
This was the origin, character, and position of the battalion when engaged, in co-operation with the squadron under my command, in accomplishing the objects which I had in view. 
</p><p>
Such was the posture of things when <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> arrived in California, and when he joined me in San Diego. He brought with him a very inconsiderable force, wholly insufficient of itself to accomplish the important objects of 
tranquillizing the province and subjecting it to the authority of the Union, by the suppression of the insurrection which had been organized for the purpose 
of recovering the positions we occupied, overthrowing the government we had organized, and expelling us from the country, if, indeed, it had proved itself 
able to defend itself without our aid. When <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> declined the proffers I made to him of devolving upon him the high and responsible position of 
commander-in-chief ; when he volunteered to act as my aid in the march against 
the enemy; when, at his own request, I assigned to him the position of commander of the troops ; when the battles were fought which broke and dispersed 
the army of the insurgents ; when, finally, we entered in triumph Ciudad de los Angeles, during this entire period I had not received any intelligence of the movements of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Major Fremont</a>. 
</p><p>
The battalion was never placed under the command of <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> by me, and was not subjected to his orders. It still remained in immediate subordination to me and to my authority. Up to the period last mentioned, viz.: the 
date of our occupation of Ciudad de los Angeles, the only authority which <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> had exercised, while he accompanied me, was simply that authority 
which he had asked me to give him, and which he had voluntarily accepted at my hands. 
</p><p>
No one has ever pretended I certainly never claimed that I possessed any right or authority to command <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> as such. All the power which 
I ever claimed or exercised over him was derived from his volunteering to aid 
me and to act under my orders. This connection, being purely one created by 
mutual consent, was, at any time, dissoluble at the will of either of the parties. 
As I could not originally have compelled <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> to assume the position he held, neither had I any authority to detain him in it one moment against 
his inclination. He might, at any time, have laid down his character as a volunteer under me, and resumed his official rank and rights as brigadier-general in the army of the United States. 
</p><p>
In his capacity of brigadier-general, however, he had no authority to command me or any portion of my force. I was as independent of him as he confessedly was of me. If the force which I had brought ashore from the squadron 
constituted a portion of the navy, if the California battalion, which I had raised and organized, was ever rightfully subject to my orders, both were as independent of <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, or any other officer of the army, as I myself was. 
</p><p>
Nor have I ever questioned, much less denied, the authority of <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> to assume command over and give his orders to <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont</a>. He might, at any time, without my controverting his power, have 
directed <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont</a> to leave my command, to terminate his connection with me as a volunteer under my command, and to report to him for 
orders. With any such exercise of authority I should never have interfered ; whether rightfully or wrongfully exercised was not for me to judge. That was 
a matter dependent upon the relative rights and duties of the parties themselves, as fixed by the military law, and to be decided by military authority. 
</p><p>
I did, however, and do still, deny that <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, while occupying the position of volunteer under my command, had any authority whatever, as 
brigadier-general, over any portion of the forces serving under me. I deny that after the character of volunteer was laid down, and that of brigadier-general resumed, he had, as such, any authority, nor could the Secretary of War give him 
any such authority over any portion of the force which I had organized. What ever authority he might lawfully exercise over <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont</a> personally, I deny that it reached to the battalion organized under me and by me 
placed under the command of that officer. And, finally, I deny that <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> could rightfully control me in my conduct as governor of California, more especially after having explicitly refused to accept the supreme authority 
when voluntarily tendered to him. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, faithfully, your obedient servant,

</p><p>
TO THE EDITORS OF THE CALIFORNIAN, MONTEREY: 
</p><p>
GENTLEMEN : In an editorial article in the  Californian of the 13th February, you may find the following paragraph : 
</p><p>
Commodore Stockton announced to the officers that the whole expedition was placed under the command of <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, himself holding his station as 
Commander-in-chief of California, and <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> did command the whole expedition 
</p><p>
I take the first opportunity to say to you that the above paragraph is not true in any one of its important particulars. It is not true that I placed the whole 
expedition under the command of <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, nor did I so announce it. 
</p><p>
On the request of <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, and with the consent of Lieutenant Rowan, (to whom, with the consent of Lieutenant Minor, who had previously 
held it, I had given the command only the night before,) I appointed <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> to command the troops, and so announced it; at the same time, stated 
distinctly that I still retained my own position as Commander-in-chief. The word California did not pass my lips upon that occasion. 
</p><p>
Now, Messrs. Editors, if you say that I delegated, or intended to delegate, to <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, or to any one else, any part of my duty or authority as the 
director of the expedition or Commander-in-chief of the forces, or that <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a>, or any other person but myself, exercised, or pretended to exercise, 
any such power or authority from the time we left San Diego until we arrived at the Ciudad de los Angeles, then I must say to you that all such statements are false. 
</p><p>
But, Messrs. Editors, it is quite true that  Commodore Stockton did leave San Diego at the head of the forces at his command, and marched into the Ciudad de los Angeles in the same way. 
</p><p>
There are other most glaring misstatements in the editorial referred to, which, no doubt, in due season, will be corrected. In the mean time, go on. 
</p><p>
Sic iter ad astra. 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
R. F. STOCKTON. 
</p><p>
P.S. This communication has been delayed in the hope that I could be at Monterey before this time.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
I thank you for your letter and a copy of the recent speech delivered by you in the Senate of the United States. 
</p><p>
I need say nothing in commendation of your course, which has been so generally approved, and will proceed (without referring to any difference of opinion 
that may seem to exist between us on the subject) to communicate to you my candid and long-cherished opinions on the subject of slavery as it exists in the 
United States, and the duty of the Government and the people in connection with it. 
</p><p>
In view of a national crisis in the affairs of Great Britain, one of her eminent statesmen once said,  In order to be prepared for the trials of these times, we 
should be possessed of a prompt facility of adverting in all our doubts to some grand and comprehensive truth. In a deep and strong soil must that tree fix 
its roots, the height of which is to reach to heaven, and the sight of it to the ends of the earth. 
</p><p>
A great crisis presents itself in the path of the Republic. Interests of incalculable consequence are involved in it to you, to myself, to every citizen consequences not limited to our times, but extending onward to all future generations, and, if there is any thing in the hopes that have been cherished of the 
universally progressive principles of liberty, to the world for ages to come. There are times (says another eminent person) when the assertion of great 
principles is the best service a man can render society, and this is such a time. We are all called upon to pause at the present crisis and consider well what 
are the demands of duty. It is no time to palter about party distinctions or sectional differences ; now, if ever, it becomes us to feel that we are Americans 
only Americans. It is no time to calculate questions of personal popularity ; that sacrifice which any citizen may make is as nothing, if it contributes to save 
his country. A Jerseyman myself, born on one of those proud battle-fields where American liberty was purchased, bearing a life devoted to the service of 
the Union, I can withhold nothing from the cause of that Union with which I solemnly believe liberty is herself identified, one and inseparable. 
</p><p>
It appears to me that the polar truth to which the view of our fellow-citizens should be directed in the present emergency is this: that God works in the 
affairs of nations, and shapes them to his purposes ; and that to ascertain his will we must study in the school of his providences, and take counsel from the 
observation of his ways to regulate our own. The destinies of men and of nations are in the bosom of the Most High. He lives in the history of the past ; 
he will live in the history of the future ; and he who has most deeply reflected upon the records of the past has most clearly seen that the great characteristics 
which have marked the progress of every nation, in every age, have eventually resulted in the accomplishment of some grand design in which the hand of 
Providence, though for a time obscured by shadows, has been at last clearly and distinctly seen. 
</p><p>
Of this our own history furnishes a luminous example. The preparation for the erection of the great temple of civil and religious liberty we now inhabit 
began in the discoveries and convulsions of the fifteenth century. The materials for it were found in men schooled by providential trials and disciplined to the 
work they were to commence ; and it is as rational to suppose the world was the production of chance, as to suppose that the combination of events which 
led them to this continent, which cherished and protected their infant colonies, which brought about the Revolution and its results, and has made us what we 
are, was the work of chance ; it is this which inspires me with hope that He 
who founded the Republic will save it that he has great purposes to accomplish yet, and that they will be unfolded through successive years for ages to 
come, in perfecting the institutions of a rational freedom here, and in extending them to all other continents. 
</p><p>
Though men were the instruments, the American Revolution was the work of an unseen Power ; the actors in it themselves looked back with astonishment 
at the course they had taken and the results that had been accomplished. The greater the event, the more clearly has the hand of Providence always been 
seen in it ; the greater the hero, the more heartfelt always has been his acknowledgment that a superior destiny controlled his actions. The American Constitution is the result of a fearful struggle. Its full price was by no means the 
sufferings undergone in the conflict. The series of events by which it was accomplished we are now able to trace distinctly back, through the privations 
and trials of the early colonists, to the days when popular freedom first began the contest with arbitrary power in the civil wars of England ; and its pathway 
is everywhere marked with patient endurance and costly sacrifice. 
</p><p>
Things permanently good are of slow growth : the offspring of hardship, they are made strong through suffering. So universal is this law, that the most 
hasty minds have a secret misgiving of the efficacy of hasty products ; and we would as soon expect undisciplined troops to be equal to the hardships and 
perils of a dangerous campaign, as that an undisciplined community could triumph in that fiercest of all warfares, the warfare which marks everywhere 
the pathway to national existence, greatness, and virtue. 
</p><p>
More than two centuries have passed since the events which were to result in founding the Republic were put in motion ; and who does not perceive, both in 
our colonial and constitutional history, that the process by which we have, within a comparatively few years, come to the full achievement of a distinctive 
nationality, has been one mainly of forbearance and self-denial? Nor have we been the only sufferers. When our ancestors came to this country, they found 
it in the possession of another race. That race has had their day. A great continent, fitted by nature for large developments in the progress of humanity, had beer, for centuries committed to their keeping, and they had proved faithless to their trust. It was manifest, from the commencement of the struggles, 
that one of the two races must give way to the other, and no one doubts the beneficence of that Providence which decided for the Anglo-Saxon race. Yet 
how touching is the story of the red man's wrongs ! We commiserate his sufferings, while we clearly see that the decree by which his race wastes away before 
the advancing footsteps of civilization is the fiat of Infinite Wisdom. 
</p><p>
The same all-pervading Providence has brought us in contact with still an other race, the African, but under widely different circumstances. Out of 
this circumstance, and the events connected with it, the crisis we are now considering has grown. Three millions of that race, scattered through fifteen of 
the States of the Union, are in the condition of servitude. Individuals in the non-slaveholding States have not only been long in the habit of denouncing the 
holding of slaves as a sin, as, indeed, among the worst of crimes, but have insisted on immediate and unconditional abolition have carried on the work of 
agitation have encouraged slaves to desert their masters have protected fugitive slaves from pursuit and reclamation, and have even gone so far as to declare that it was cause for separating from the South altogether. 
</p><p>
The General Government has been agitated ; compromise after compromise has been made, and proved, as was to be expected, only the means of postponing rather than of settling the question, until at last things have reached a 
condition that real danger to the Union seems to be apprehended by the wisest men of both sections of the country. It is time for men now to speak out, calmly, but fearlessly. Whatever has been wrong should be made right, and 
the question settled now and forever. We should not meanly shrink from our just responsibilities and put them upon our children. 
</p><p>
Now, in reference to the relation of master and slave, it is proper we should bear in mind that African slavery was introduced into this country by no act of ours. For its introduction the American people are in no just sense responsible. 
Its introduction here was the act of Great Britain while we were her colonies. 
She engrafted this system into our communities at a time when these communities (then in their infancy) were unable to make any effectual resistance. 
Our ancestors, at the time, and through all the process by which it was accomplished, remonstrated and protested against it; but their remonstrances and 
protests were unheeded. Its introduction was considered by the early colonists an evil a measure of oppression to them as well as to the slave ; but they were as powerless to resist it as the slave himself. 
</p><p>
So far as we are concerned, this circumstance in our condition is providential. If we would presume to scrutinize and judge the ways of Providence, we are driven back to first principles. God rules in the affairs of nations and of men 
as an absolute sovereign, and shapes all human events to his great purposes. The purposes he designed to accomplish in all this may be involved in comparative darkness now; but if it shall appear hereafter that this was the means 
by which, in the lapse of centuries, he accomplished the redemption of Africa her self, who will say that the means he chose were inconsistent with his wisdom or his goodness? 
</p><p>
This fact, then, is undisputed, that when the battles of the Revolution had been fought when the North and the South had passed shoulder to shoulder through that long and bloody and self-sacrificing struggle, and the independence 
of their country was achieved, the institution of slavery, planted by other hands in our midst, existed. A very large number of our citizens, both in the North 
and South, were slaveholders. Property is the creature of the law, and slaves had been made property by law been so held for ages. What was to be done ? The general welfare the preservation of all that had been gained the law of 
self-defence required that a Government should be established, and that this Government should embrace and combine in one indissoluble union all the liberated colonies. If that had not been accomplished, all would have been 
shipwrecked together. 
</p><p>
The men of the Revolution saw this plainly. They were men equal to the crisis. They considered the question as a whole. They sacrificed on the altar of concession their different views and interests as to particulars, that they 
might reach harmoniously the grand result. The articles of confederation, and subsequently the Constitution, were the results of compromise; and whatever politicians may say the spirit the intent the fair construction of that com 
promise is, that the institution of slavery belongs exclusively to the States, as a matter of State regulation, and that the General Government has nothing to do with it. 
</p><p>
No power over it was delegated by the Constitution to the General Government, (except as to the importation of slaves into the States,) nor was any such 
power prohibited by it to the States. It was expressly provided that persons held to service or labour in one State under the laws thereof, escaping into an 
other, should not be discharged from such service or labour, but should be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labour might be due ; 
and by an amendment to the Constitution, adopted in <a href='/results.php?year=1791'>1791</a>, it was provided that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the 
people. Such is the Constitution such the compromise upon which it was formed such the imperative necessity of that compromise : and even if that 
compromise and that Constitution were the result of a mistake, it is binding now, and as long as it shall remain unaltered, on every law-abiding man. 
</p><p>
If the toleration of slavery if the permission for its existence in any part of the Union was a great national crime, when and by whom was that crime committed ? At the formation of the Government, at the adoption of the Constitution, and by the Washingtons, the Roger Shermans, the Hamiltons, the Madisons, the Franklins, the Pinkneys, of the land by such men as Livingston and 
Paterson, Brearly and Dayton, of my own native State, approved and sanctioned with unparalleled unanimity by the North and South. Under its auspices, I 
need not say with what giant strides the Republic has advanced to greatness and prosperity, nor that heaven has smiled propitiously upon our common heritage. 
</p><p>
Now, the question which has come up with such a threatening aspect before the country is, in my judgment, one of morals, not of politics, questions always 
the most difficult and dangerous to deal with, because they do not lie in notions of expediency, but in matters of conscience. They are always liable to run into 
fanaticism, and are always mingled with questions of religious faith and moral obligation. The question is one of morals, and as such it is to be settled, if 
settled permanently at all. Out of this aspect of the case have sprung, as incidents, all the questions that have heretofore been and are now the subjects of 
discussion. The Convention of 87, the Missouri Compromise, the contested 
question of abolition petitions in Congress, the agitations in the North, the recriminations of the South, the difficulties about fugitive slaves, and latterly, the 
California question and the Wilmot Proviso, are all but branches of one fruitful tree the question as to the moral character of slavery as it exists in the States, 
and the moral duty consequent upon that character. In reference to those phases or incidents of this question, which involve the action of the Government, 
they never would have been unsettled, or at any rate never would have come up in their present embarrassing forms, if the General Government had adhered, as 
it ought in my opinion to have adhered, from the beginning, to a strict construction of the Constitution. The framers of this instrument meant to exclude, 
and by the language of the instrument did exclude, the national Government from all action upon the subject. 
</p><p>
They granted no such power ; they expressly excluded all powers not granted. Whenever the doctrine of inferential powers that latitudinarian doctrine comes fully to be insisted on and adopted, the Constitution will become itself a 
thing of wax, to be moulded, by the ever-changing opinions of men, into whatever shape those opinions happen to take ; the majority will become supreme ; 
its will, the Constitution, and every thing conservative, will be liable to be broken down. Suppose a measure oppressive ruinous to one portion of the 
Union, is adopted by a mere constitutional majority, and in constitutional form: 
it is said the party complaining and denying its constitutionality has an appeal to the Supreme Court. But to argue that that is always to be regarded as 
a place of absolute security, is to argue that it is infallible. It undergoes the process of change by death ; the new incumbents are apt to partake of the views 
of the Constitution held by a majority of the Government, and the Court to become itself the advocate of those views. Beyond this are the rocks, the breakers 
of revolution the dernier resort of an oppressed people. The Constitution itself was originally intended to be the cable and anchor of the Union and all its 
parts ; and nothing, you may rely upon it, but the doctrine of a strict construction, can ever preserve it what it was intended to be. 
</p><p>
Upon the question of domestic slavery in the States and in the territories, non intervention is the true principle. There the letter of the Constitution placed it, 
and there it should be left. The law of nature, fixing the bounds of the institution by the unalterable constitution of the coloured race, the temperature of 
the climate and nature of the soil, and the will of the people acting through the 
State Legislatures upon their several States, are the true and legitimate regulators ; and all interference, except moral suasion, the power of argument, the 
free expression of opinion, ought to be excluded. 
</p><p>
I now come to the main question the question which lies back of all the others. 1. Is domestic slavery a sin, or an unmitigated evil? and, 2. What is 
the duty of the people of the non-slaveholding States respecting it? These questions go to the root of the whole difficulty. 
</p><p>
1. Is domestic slavery a sin, or an unmitigated evil? In order to arrive at an intelligent conclusion respecting the right or the wrong of any complex 
scheme or any existing institution, we must be careful not to array our feelings against our reason ; nor ought we to allow our displeasure at particular cases 
of excess to interfere with a fair and deliberate consideration of the general working and tendency of the system as a whole. It belongs to this question to 
consider, 1. The condition of the coloured man as it would have been had he been left in Africa. 2. The circumstances under which we find him here. 3. 
The necessity, if such there be, of his present continuance in the condition in which we find him. 4. The ultimate tendency of what may seem to be a providential arrangement of this state of things. 
</p><p>
1. Of all the races of men with which history and travel have acquainted us, there is none so sunk beyond all hope of self-restoration as the African on his wide continent. In ignorance so utter that he is elevated little above the brute, 
in superstition so gross that it drags him even lower than the brute, without a thought of liberty, he is the sport of tyranny in its lowest, meanest, and most cruel forms ; he has nothing he can call his own ; he has no idea of God, of 
justice, of moral obligation, of the rights of persons or property. In a word, Africa has long forgotten God, and God has abandoned Africa but not, I trust, forever. From such a land and such a condition sold, bartered away by 
his countrymen the slave was brought to these shores while we were colonists and subject to British law. Here he is in a civilized and Christian country ; he has more opportunities of enlightenment than he would have had in Africa ; he 
is, as a general rule, treated with kindness ; he is protected from want in sickness and old age, and is, on the whole, better off, safer, happier, than he would have been in his native country. 
</p><p>
2. But in the second place, with the moral character of the act bringing the slave to this country we have now nothing to do. We find him here ; the thing is done. So far as the slave-trade is concerned, we have acted on that, and abolished it. Slavery was introduced in other times and under other auspices. It existed when the Government was established; an institution which could not 
be got rid of which had of necessity to be tolerated. Slaves had been made property in the Colonies by British law. The Government found it au existing 
institution, and the Constitution left it so of necessity, imperative and uncontrollable to be enacted on exclusively by the States, subject to the moulding 
and changing and controlling opinions and consciences of those concerned. These have not been inactive. In many of the States the institution has been 
abolished ; in others, meliorated ; in all, it is a question for opinion and conscience to act upon. As the General Government has no power to abolish it, 
so it has no power to prevent any State from abolishing it. 
</p><p>
3. In the third place, every considerate man. sees that in the present condition of things slavery cannot be immediately and absolutely abolished. We 
must reason about things as they are not as we might wish them to be. The slave is property; he became so by a law of our common ancestors ; he was left 
in that condition by the law of our common fathers who founded the Republic. 
The burden of this purchase should be borne in all justice, equally by our citizens, and we are not ready to pay the price. But, if we were ready, he is not in 
a condition to take care of himself. He has not the culture, the training, the experience, necessary to self-dependence. And where is he to go? No reflecting 
man is prepared to say he is willing to have three millions of slaves turned loose in the States, to fill the prisons and poor-houses and alms-houses of the country, 
or to live by plunder on the community. What, too, is to be his lot for the future in such a case? Is he to live in our midst as a marked and degraded 
being, through all time, or are we prepared to place him on an equality with us, civilly and socially. Are we ready for amalgamation? 
</p><p>
There seems under those circumstances to be a necessity for his continuance at present in the condition in which he is placed. 
</p><p>
In the fourth place, the hand of Providence seems to be clearly pointing out an ultimate design in all this arrangement of things. Yonder is Africa, with her 
one hundred and fifty millions of miserable, degraded, ignorant, lawless, superstitious idolaters. Whoever has stood upon her sands, has stood upon a continent that has geographical and physical peculiarities which belong to no other 
of the great divisions of the globe. The latter appear, upon the face of them, to 
have been adapted to draw out the energies of the natives in their inequalities 
of temperature, soil, and surface, inviting the ingenuity and enterprise of man 
to overcome them, and in the varieties of their products tempting the inter 
changes of commerce ; thus affording ample encouragement to the progress of 
civil and social improvement. But Africa is still, as of old, a land of silence and 
of mystery. Like the interminable dreariness of her own deserts, her moral 
wastes of mind lie waiting for the approach of influences from abroad. No 
savage people have ever advanced to a civilized state without intercommunication with others. All the continents of the world have, in their turn, been occupied and civilized by means of colonies ; but in no one of them did it appear so 
inevitably necessary, from, a previous examination of circumstances, as in that 
of Africa. It is plain to the very eye that Africa is a land to which civilization 
must be brought. The attempt has been made over and over again, by devoted 
missionaries and others, to penetrate that land and seek to impart the blessings 
of civilization and Christianity to her savage hordes. But the labour has been, 
spent in vain. The white man cannot live in Africa. The annals of the Moravians, of Cape Colony, of Sierra Leone, of Liberia, contain the records of the 
sacrifice of some of the best men that have lived to grace the pages of any 
people's history, in the vain attempt to accomplish something for her redemption through the instrumentality of white men. Who, then, is to do this work
</p><p>
Let now any calm, reflecting spectator of the present state of the world be 
asked to look at Africa, and then, from among the nations, point out the people 
best calculated to do this work ; and when his eye falls upon the descendants of 
the sons of that continent now in America, will he not say, These are the people 
appointed for that work
</p><p>
The ways of God are mysterious. So Joseph was sold a slave into Egypt ; so 
his father and his brethren were driven thither by providential circumstances; 
so their generations remained as slaves in Egypt for four centuries and a half; 
and, when the appointed time had come, in His own appointed way the Ruler 
of nations led them to the accomplishment of His great purposes. And it is not to be forgotten that it was not the act of holding this people in bondage for so 
many years, that Pharaoh and the Egyptians were punished ; but their crime 
was this : that when the Divine Being had prepared all things for the event he 
proposed to accomplish, and demanded, by an accredited ambassador, that they 
should be allowed to depart, they would not let the people go. 
</p><p>
The great progenitor of the Israelites was a slaveholder ; the Israelites, after their emancipation, became slaveholders. Nothing is clearer than that under 
the Mosaic dispensation slavery was lawful ; the institution was recognised and regulated by the law of Moses; and the founder of Christianity and his disciples (though Judea and all the provinces of the Roman empire were in their 
times full of slaves, and slaves subjected to the most rigid laws) never forbade or even denounced the relation as sinful, or exhorted masters to liberate their 
slaves ; but enjoined on masters the principles of humanity and justice, and on slaves obedience and contentment ; and those notions of morality may well be 
questioned which in our days disallow what Christ and his apostles did not disallow. 
</p><p>
Such an Exodus as that of the Jews from Egypt may not be within the purpose of the Deity in relation to the children of Africa now in this country, or 
their descendants. But has He no purpose in all this arrangement that has been 
going on, in the gathering of a vast family of these people here, in their condition of servitude, endurance, discipline, in the difficulties with which their 
emancipation is surrounded, in the natural impossibility that the whites ever 
will or can consent to raise them to a condition of equality? No purpose in 
casting their lot in a country so free for the interchange of opinion, and where 
opinion is so enlightened and progressive and there is so much benevolence and 
Christian enterprise? Has he not a purpose in all this, to accomplish (in some 
way of his own, through this instrumentality) the regeneration of the millions 
of benighted Africa? The germs of colonies are already planted there as the 
fruits of this system of servitude. But the free African among us clings to 
this country still, under all his disabilities, regardless of the claims of the land 
of his fathers upon him ; and may not slavery and the necessity of migration as 
the condition of his release be the appointed instrument to produce compliance? 
The colonies we have settled in Africa would, ere this day, have become a Re 
public of power, had the free negroes of the North been willing to become citizens of it. But, like the Israelites of old, who would, but for the Divine inter 
position, have sacrificed their liberators in the wilderness and returned into 
Egypt, these liberated descendants of Africa cannot be persuaded to look towards 
the land of their fathers. The millions of their coloured bondmen there waken 
no sympathy in their hearts. Their fixed and resoluted purpose appears to be 
to remain among the whites and force themselves by progressive steps into a 
civil and social equality with them ; and it is chiefly with a view to strengthen 
themselves in these particular views and aspirations, that they band together 
under the abolition flag, and fill our cities with threats of vengeance against the 
white race if they shall dare to execute the laws in relation to fugitive slaves. 
</p><p>
Now, when we came to reflect calmly and candidly upon all these circumstances, in connection with the question, Is domestic slavery, as it exists at the 
South, a sin? it seems to me that question must be answered in the negative. The relation of master and slave may be, and doubtless is, sometimes the occasion of cruelty and injustice. But this is also true of the relation of husband 
and wife, parent and child, master and apprentice, and of employer and employed in our system of labour. But the abuses of a system or relation form no sound argument against the system or relation itself. I am no apologist for 
abuse. I am as ready as any man to denounce cruelty, unnatural separations, a disregard of the domestic relations, or a deprivation of the means of moral and religious culture to the slave, under our system of slavery, as a crime. But the 
correction of these belongs to the duties of the State Governments. We, in New Jersey, have no more right to interfere with South Carolina than she with us, in such matters; nor in fact have we in New Jersey any more right to interfere 
with the slaves of South Carolina or Georgia than we have with the slaves of Russia or Austria, each Southern State being, in respect to this question, as absolutely sovereign as are Russia and Austria. We are to reason about the 
institution of slavery as we reason about every other human institution, from its proper, humane, conscientious and lawful use, when both parties discharge their mutual obligations. 
</p><p>
Having established, as I think, that domestic slavery, as it exists in the Southern States, is not in itself sinful or an unmitigated evil, this subject is relieved from its greatest embarrassment; and now I proceed to consider : What is 
the duty of the people of non-slave-holding States respecting Slavery ? 
</p><p>
Shall we attempt forcibly to break down this institution of slavery ? To make the attempt is : 
</p><p>
First. To violate the Constitution and its compromises. I care not whether 
under colour of inferential instruction assuming the Constitution to imply the 
power of interference (which, by-the-way. I unconditionally deny) or acting 
regardless of it. In either case it is, at best, the appeal to the mere majority 
power, acting upon and forcing the minority. 
</p><p>
Second. It is to attempt the liberation of the slave, and fail. For by the effort 
the most we can do is to drive the South with its slaves out of the Union without 
liberating a single slave; and, 
</p><p>
Third. It is to compel a dissolution of the Union. Have the people considered 
the consequences implied in this branch of the alternative? Suppose, after all, 
that, in opposition to the plain teachings of the Bible and the judgment of God's 
holiest men, they still hold that slavery is in itself sinful, and the owners of slaves 
are men-stealers, robbers and pirates, then, indeed, this question assumes a more 
serious aspect, and Mr. Calhoun may no longer be denounced as either unpatriotic or extravagant in calling for an amendment of the Constitution, or any 
other means that will secure his constituents from imminent peril and his posterity from the calamities of civil war. But 
</p><p>
Is there not, in this view, a crime of deeper and redder dye, in marching over a desecrated Bible and a broken compact to shed oceans of fraternal blood? Is 
it lawful, on their own principles, to do evil that good may come even if good could by it be accomplished? If they succeed in driving the South to a secession, they inevitably kindle the fire of a conflagration which will burn over this whole 
Republic until it reduces to ashes the structure which Providence has for centuries been preparing and rearing up on this continent ; and, in the conflagration, their own homes and hopes will be mingled with the sacrifice. 
</p><p>
One great principle, says Dr. Channing, which we should lay down as immovably true, is, that if a good work cannot be carried on by the calm, self-controlled, benevolent spirit of Christianity, then the time for doing it has not 
come. God asks not the aid of our vices. He can overrule them for good, but they are not the chosen instruments of human happiness. But if we would adopt, as I sincerely do, the other alternative that with the institution of 
slavery as it exists in the South we have nothing to do that we are not only prohibited by the Constitution from meddling with it, but that it is a question of conscience to be settled by Southern men for themselves a question upon 
which good men may differ, and must be left to differ if they will, whether in the North or South a new train of thoughts, a new field of benevolent and Christian enterprise, opens before us. Going back to the great truth from which 
we started, and regarding all the circumstances of the present state of things as a part of the design of Providence to accomplish a great result for Africa, there is a work, and a great work, for us to do. Let the great heart of Christian 
benevolence in the North and the South unite in selecting from this vast African family this nursery planted and growing on our shores the proper subjects to be sent upon the mission of redemption to the land of their ancestors, until the 
last slave shall have departed, and Africa's long night shall have been dispelled by the sun of freedom and civilization. The philanthropist will find here enough to do to satisfy the largest benevolence, in acts, in personal sacrifices, 
in contributions to the cause of humanity, without the violation of personal or legal rights doing good that good may come. 
</p><p>
Let the General Government, then, retrace its steps; and instead of provisos, and compromise lines, and agreements to keep up the balance of power, fall 
back upon the literal construction of the Constitution adopt the principle of total non-intervention, now and forever leaving the laws of nature and the voice 
of public opinion to adjust the limits of the institution, free, uncontrolled, and uninfluenced by the action of Congress, and all will be safe. The Gordian knot will be dissolved not cut and the ark of the covenant, with its sacred deposit, be borne on safely to its destination. 
</p><p>
The measures, in short, which I would propose, are 
</p><p>
1st. A declarative act, in such form as may be deemed proper, that the Constitution gives no power to the General Government to act on the subject of 
domestic slavery, either with respect to its existence in the States, the Territories, or the District of Columbia. 
</p><p>
2d. The most efficient act that can be framed to enforce the provisions of the Constitution in relation to fugitive slaves. 
</p><p>
3d. That California, in consideration of the peculiar circumstances of her case, be admitted without the approval or disapproval of that part of her Constitution which relates to slavery. 
</p><p>
I believe these three positions, carried out, would settle the question forever. They involve no concessions no compromise; they are no temporary expedient. They put the solution of the difficulty on the eternal principles of right the 
law of the Constitution. 
</p><p>
I think the great majority of the North and South are prepared to place it there, and, having placed it there, to stand by and maintain the Union at all hazards. 
</p><p>
I feel that I have already trespassed too long on your patience. But it is a subject of vast importance, and I cannot close this letter without a few general remarks in reference to the foregoing views. 
</p><p>
At such a time all good men will forbear, exchange opinions, and reason in the spirit of conciliation. 
</p><p>
Conscientious differences of opinion among men will always exist in relation to moral questions. 
</p><p>
Some conscientious men believe slavery to be a sin; other conscientious men 
believe that the law of property which enables one man to hold what they insist 
is the common gift of the Creator to his creatures, is sin. Again, still, other 
conscientious men hold that to take a glass of wine is sin ; and so on, through an 
endless variety of subjects. 
</p><p>
If these conscientious opinions, or any of them, pervade the majority, are all 
who do not hold them to be driven with fire and sword out of the Union, or 
compelled to yield their opinions, equally conscientious, to the majority? These 
notions are inconsistent with a wise moderation ; they come from an abuse of 
reason in the first place, and a proposed abuse of power in the second. 
</p><p>
Such arguments are always drawn principally from the excesses of a system, rather than from the system itself, and there lies the error; it is the error of 
fanaticism, which always puts in the plea of conscience, whether it burns the supposed heretic at the stake, or hunts down witchcraft, or impales the Nestorian, or fans the flame of civil war. 
</p><p>
Instead of railing with infuriated declamation against a system because of 
its excesses, which are incident to every human institution, we should calmly 
and dispassionately seek to extract the truth from the general rule rather than 
from its exceptions. The system of slavery, like every human system, has its 
excesses its exceptions from the general rule. But it is quite probable that 
there may exist in the one, as in the other, an absolute law, which is working 
out a beneficent result. If a man wishes to fall under the delusion of a universal fanaticism, it is only necessary that he adopt the method of looking at 
the special attendants of every system to the exclusion of the general law which 
regulates them, and the work is done; while he is intent with some accident of 
the train, the train itself has long since passed on, leaving him to grow more 
and more inflated with conceit, indignation, unholy zeal, and misanthropic rail 
ing, all the natural results of so narrow-minded a procedure. Let every man 
run off with particular features out of the general complexion of any subject or 
thought, and gaze at those features long enough and absorbingly enough, and the best thing within the range of human experience will become to him a bug 
bear. The individual, however, who neglects the great law of compensation 
in judging of human affairs, has only to apply the same method of judging to 
himself; and, passing by his redeeming qualities and looking only at his own 
excesses and defects, he will find in himself, if he is honest in the search, enough 
to satiate his appetite for condemnation and hate. It is far easier to condemn 
than to judge correctly far easier to get into a passion about a subject than to 
get a comprehension of it.

The idea that out of the institution of domestic slavery in this country is to 
spring the regeneration of Africa, derives, it seems to me, great force from the 
recurrence to past history. 
</p><p>
We invariably find that, in the dispensation of Providence, nations which have 
been called to act an important part in the work of human progress have been 
led through a long previous discipline of trial; the restraints and endurance of 
youth have preceded the power and efficiency of manhood. Primary subjection 
is the law of stable growth, and seems an indispensable condition of the advancement of our race. 
</p><p>
We have only to look back through a few centuries to find the evidences of 
this in the annals of our race.. Our ancestors were for centuries a down-trodden, 
enslaved, and toiling people. The Anglo-Saxon race have become what they are 
by a long training in the school of patient endurance; in the case of England, 
under oppressive servitude to the Roman and the Norman ; in the case of America, 
under the oppression of our mother-country and the trying discipline of Colonial 
suffering. In the life of a nation, hundreds of years may be as a day in the life 
of an individual. It is often necessary for many generations to pass, before a 
new influence can be made to affect the mass. If all were willing, the work of 
national preparation might be more rapid; but thousands are to be made willing, 
and by the providential adaptation of the means to the end. 
</p><p>
It is conceded, on all hands, that the probation of the African people now in bondage on our shores is to come to an end. 
</p><p>
That, while there is an interchange of benefits between the parties, there is at the same time a community of evil, which renders it better, both for the whites and the blacks, that it should come to an end. 
</p><p>
When shall that time be? is the great question before the American people. 
</p><p>
In seeking an answer to this question, we may be sure there is some safer ground on which to take our stand than that of political chicane, of fanatical prejudice, or of any merely temporary or prudential expediency. 
</p><p>
If slavery is to be abolished now, then it is to be done in a moment. That is 
to say, at one stroke a community of three millions of people, habituated to a 
certain way of life, are to be thrown into new circumstances: a thing plainly 
preposterous, because no kind of society changes its customs suddenly and succeeds in doing well. Great changes in society must come in with previous preparation, or they come in to little purpose. Seven years sufficed to fight the 
battles of the Revolution, but many more were spent in preparation for that 
event, and many more will be required to perfect its results. If Providence 
rules in the affairs of nations, the existence of slavery has some prospective 
purpose, only to be accomplished by prior preparation for it. 
</p><p>
Let us not be impatient or presumptuous. These African people are passing 
to their destiny along the same path which has been trod by other nations, 
through a mixture of hardship, of endurance, but in a land of light and amid 
a civilized society. They are preparing to accomplish a work for their native 
continent which no other people in the world can accomplish. Their plain 
mission is ultimately to carry the gifts of society, of religion, of government, 
to the last remaining continent of the earth, where these blessings are totally 
unknown. Their work is a great one, as it would seem to be connected essentially with the final and universal triumph of civilization and Christianity in 
the world. It is our duty to follow, not to attempt to lead in the ways and purposes of Providence. We are to move forward when the pillar of fire and cloud moves forward, and to rest when it rests. 
</p><p>
Doubtless there is a time for action; but it is characteristic of all great changes that they make known their own seasons. That time, in the present instance, has not yet come for the manifest reason that the way is not yet open 
for it. When the time shall come, the way will come with it, the preparations for it be complete. The North settled this question easily, quietly. Surely, it 
is no great stretch of charity for us to suppose that in due time the same thing will be accomplished in the South. We of the North have given no peculiar 
evidence of superior goodness, that we should suppose the South not to be possessed of as much justice, charity, and good sense, as ourselves. 
</p><p>
I firmly believe that the hour for the complete enfranchisement of the Southern Slave will be the hour of the complete preparation for the work of African 
redemption and civilization ; and that hour will make itself known in the removal of all obstacles here and there, in the preparation of the workmen and 
the work ; and I earnestly hope that guided by happier influences than seem now to pervade the country, the pulpit, the press, the people of the North and 
the South may give their thoughts and efforts to this subject in the spirit of Him whose mission to our earth was heralded by the proclamation of peace and good-will.

With great regard, yours,
