SIR : I am informed that you are now engaged in organizing a civil government and appointing officers for it in this territory. 
As this duty has been specially assigned to myself, by orders of the President of the United States, conveyed in letters to me from the 
Secretary of War, of June 3, 8, and 18, 1846, the original of which I gave to you on the 12th, and which you returned to me on 
the 18th, and copies of which I furnished you with on the 26th December, I have to ask if you have any authority from the 
President, from the Secretary of the Navy, or from any other channel of the President, to form such government and make such appointments. 
</p><p>
If you have such authority, and will show it to me or furnish me with a certified copy of it, I will cheerfully acquiesce in what 
you are doing. If you have not such authority, I then demand that you cease all further proceedings relating to the formation of 
a civil government for this territory, as I cannot recognise in you any right in assuming to perform duties confided to me by the President. 
</p><p>
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
S. W. KEARNEY, 
</p><p>
Brigadier- General United States Army. 
</p><p>
COMMODORE R. F. STOCKTON, 
</p><p>
Acting Governor of California.

SIR : In my communication to you of yesterday's date I stated that I had learned that you were engaged in organizing a civil 
government for California. I referred you to the President's instructions to me (the original of which you have seen, and copies 
of which I furnished you) to perform that duty, and I added that if you had any authority from the President, or any of his organs, 
for what you were doing, I would cheerfully acquiesce, and, if you had not such authority, I demanded that you would cease further proceedings in the matter. 
</p><p>
Your reply of the same date refers me to a conversation held at San Diego, and adds that you cannot do any thing or desist from 
doing any thing or alter any thing on your (my) demand. As, in consequence of the defeat of the enemy on the 8th and 9th instants, 
by the troops under my command, and the capitulation entered into on the 13th instant by <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='co-worker'>Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont</a> with the 
leaders of the Californians, in which the people under arms and in the field agree to disperse and remain quiet and peaceable, the 
country may now, for the first time, be considered as conquered and taken possession of by us ; and, as I am prepared to carry out 
the President's instructions to me, which you oppose, I must, for the purpose of preventing a collision between us and possibly a 
civil war in consequence of it, remain silent for the present, leaving with you the great responsibility of doing that for which you have 
no authority, and preventing me from complying with the President's orders. 
</p><p>
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
S. W. KEARNEY, 
Brigadier-G-eneral U. S. A.

</p><p>
SIR : I fear, from the armistice which I this morning saw, signed by <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='co-worker'>Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont</a>, and sent to me by you, that our countrymen under 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='co-worker'>Colonel Fremont</a> are entirely ignorant of our being here ; that they are embarrassed in their movements. And I further fear that, unless something is done 
at once to inform them of the true state of affairs here, they may capitulate and retire to the upper country. 
</p><p>
To avoid so serious an evil, I advise and offer to take one-half of this command, from 250 to 300 men, and march at once to form a junction with Lieutenant-<a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='co-worker'>Colonel Fremont</a>.

DEAR FREMONT : I am here in possession of this place, with sailors and marines. We met and defeated the whole force of the Californians the 8th and 9th. They 
have not now to exceed three hundred men concentrated. Avoid charging them, and come to me at this place.

Acknowledge the hour of receipt of this, and when I may expect you. Regards to Russell. Yours,
