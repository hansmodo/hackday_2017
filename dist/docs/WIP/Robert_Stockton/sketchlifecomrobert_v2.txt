MY DEAR SIR : I enclose you a copy of a general order announcing to the navy the thanks of Congress for the zeal and 
ability with which its duty was performed during the late war with Mexico. 

My connection with the Navy Department for all exercise of official power has ceased, and I may gratify my own personal feelings by renewing to you in this note what I have said and intended 
to convey in my official reports, my high estimate of your zeal, energy, and gallantry, in the performance of your duties in the 
great service which resulted in the acquisition of California. Your energy and military resource in supplying your deficiency of means, 
the courage and skill with which you conducted your well-planned operations, the success with which you imparted your own enthusiasm to those whom you commanded, entitle you to the highest 
praise ; and the results of your brilliant achievements have added largely to the national strength and to the national honour. 

With such convictions on my mind, I cannot take leave of you without saying thus much, and to express the hope that I shall ever 
have the happiness of cultivating with you personally the relations of friendship. 

With the highest esteem, 

I am very truly yours, 

J. Y. MASON. 

COMMODORE R. F. STOCKTON, U. S. Navy

DEAR SIR: The generous policy which you have pursued to 
wards this office makes me regret that I have put you to the trouble to send the chairs from the ship, and am grateful for them, but did 
not consider that we had any claim, considering how much you have done. 

To you California is indebted for her first press and her first school-house. This may not be known generally now, but it will if 
I live. It is something to conquer a country ; it is also something to provide for the progressive intelligence of its inhabitants ; but it 
is rarely that, as in the present instance, the honour of both appertains to the same individual. 

These facts may seem shaded to some, but truth will vindicate itself, and every thing will stand out in its own distinct, impressive light. 

I have taken notes of all that has occurred in California since our arrival here. I commenced with your repudiation of the Bear 
flag, and have continued the history of events up to your second capture of the Pueblo; and now I will state what no one knows but 
myself, that the facts contained in Mr. Speiden's graphic description of the march from San Diego* and the battles of the 8th and 
9th are in my journal just as I recorded them the day after the letter was received. I mention this merely to vindicate my feelings 
on the occasion, and these are feelings which remain unchanged. 

I am, dear sir, very faithfully yours, 

WALTER COLTON. 

COMMODORE R. F. STOCKTON, 

United States Frigate Congress.

MY DEAR SIR : I send to you, as an old friend, a copy of my late speech in the Senate. It relates to a subject quite interesting 
to the country, as connected with the question of proper governments for those new territories which you had an important agency in bringing under the power of the United States. 

I would hardly ask your opinion of the general sentiments of the speech, although I know you are a very competent judge, 
but that, being out of the strife of politics, your judgment is not likely to be biassed, and that you have as great a stake as any man 
in the preservation of the Union and the maintenance of the Government on its true principles. 

I am, dear sir, 

With great respect, yours, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 

COMMODORE STOCKTON.

[ Instructions of the Secretary of War by virtue of which General Kearney proceeded to California ]

WAR DEPARTMENT, <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city origin'>WASHINGTON</a>, <a rel="month origin" value="6">June</a> <a rel='day origin' value='3'>3</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1846' rel="origin">1846</a>. 

SIR: I herewith send you a copy of a letter to the Governor of Missouri for an additional force of one thousand mounted men. 

The object of thus adding to the force under your command is not, as you will perceive, fully set forth in that letter, for the reason that it is deemed prudent 
that it should not at this time become a matter of public notoriety; but to you it is proper and necessary that it should be stated. 

It has been decided by the President to be of the greatest importance, in the pending war with Mexico, to take the earliest possession of Upper California. 

An expedition with that view is hereby ordered, and you are designated to command it. 

To enable you to be in sufficient force to conduct it successfully, this additional force of a thousand mounted men has been provided. 

Should you conquer and take possession of New Mexico and California, or considerable places in either, you will establish temporary civil governments therein. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

(From the California Extra, of January 28, 1847.) 

The following letter is from an officer attached to the command of Commodore Stockton, and describes with graphic force the engagements which took place on the march to the Puebla: 

<a rel='day origin' value=''>Ciudad De Los Angeles</a>, <a rel="month origin" value="1">January</a> <a rel='day origin' value='14'>14</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1847' rel="origin">1847</a>. 

I seize the moment to write you a few hasty lines, which may possibly reach you through the agency of a friend. In my last you were informed of the out break of the insurgents of California, and the trouble we should have for our 
Commodore to quell them. The plan of Commodore Stockton, of which I informed you a few weeks ago, has been fully carried out. At the head of the forces at his command, amounting to about six hundred, including the detachment of the first 
regiment of United States dragoons, under General Kearney, he left San Diego on 
the morning of the 29th December, determined again to enter the capital, take possession, and put down the insurrection. Our line of march was through a rough 
and mountainous country of nearly one hundred and fifty miles, with impediments on every side, to say nothing of the constant apprehensions of attack, 
both day and night, by our enemy on the way. Our march was, notwithstanding, rapid, and, although performed mostly by sailor troops, would have done 
credit to the best-trained army in the world. 

On the morning of the 8th of January we found ourselves, after several days hard marching and fatigue, in the vicinity of the river San Gabriel, on the north 
bank of which the enemy had fortified themselves, to the number of five hundred well-mounted men, with four pieces of artillery, and in a position so commanding that it seemed impossible to gain any point by which our troops could be protected from the most galling fire of their artillery. They had formed, as I 
before said, on the north bank, within three hundred yards of the river, and presented a front, consisting of their whole force, in three divisions, one on our 
right, the other on our left, and the third in front of the artillery. Our whole 
line advanced, while a skirmish was kept up by a party of the enemy and a detachment of our riflemen. On reaching the south side of the river, the Commodore dismounted, forded the stream, commanded the troops to pass over, which they did 
promptly, under the brisk fire of the enemy's artillery on the opposite bank. The Commodore ordered that the artillery should not unlimber until the opposite side of the river was gained. As soon as that was effected, he ordered a charge, to take the hill directly in the teeth of the enemy's guns, which soon resulted in the entire possession of the prominent point they had just occupied. An attempt was made 
by the Californians to cut off our pack-horses and cattle in the rear, all of which, however, with the exception of a few horses, were protected by our rear in the 
most creditable manner. I am not sufficiently skilled in military tactics to give a definite account of the battle; but the skill in management and determined 
courage and bravery of our Commodore gave to all the fullest confidence of a victorious result of this brilliant affair. The first gun fired was aimed by the Commodore before the charge was made up the hill, (his superior skill in gunnery 
and fondness for exercising big guns never appeared to greater advantage than on this occasion,) overthrowing the enemy's gun, which had just poured 
forth its thunder in our midst. Finding the hill in our possession, and our artillery having gained the desired point, a cannonading was now kept up for some 
time, the Commodore continuing to aim the guns, ordering his men to lie down until the moment he was ready to Jire, by which means many valuable and brave 
fellows lives were saved, as the Californians continued for some time to fire their artillery with much effect. For brevity, I must leave out many particulars. Having driven our enemy before us, we now made our camp for the night on 
the very hill they had tried so hard to defend, and where they intended (as they said) to eat us up. The number of their killed and wounded it was not possible for us to ascertain, as they carried away immediately on their horses all who fell. 

$th January. The enemy met us again to-day on the plains of the Mesa, near the city, and with bold and determined effort tried our lines on every side in a 
brisk cannonading, with several attempts to charge in upon us. The battle was kept up spiritedly for two hours and a half, when General Flores said to his 
men, I have but another discharge of artillery to make, and my last request is that you will make a bold and determined charge as our last resort. This 
they attempted ; but the firm and steady course in which our troops continued to defend themselves repelled the attempt at a charge, and we found ourselves 
again victorious in the second day's fight. The first day's fight lasted one hour and a half. At night we encamped near the battle-ground, and on the morning 
of the 10th marched into the city, and took possession while the adjacent hills were glistening with the lances of our enemies, whom we forced to disperse. 
When it is recollected that all our work to defend ourselves, our baggage-wagons, cattle, horses, and pack-mules, had to be done on foot, while our enemies were mounted on first-rate horses, is it not remarkable that we should have 
been so successful ? But it was done on the glorious 8th of January, together with the following day. Of the result of both days we are proud to boast ; but 
the 8th was indeed a brilliant affair : our war-cry was New Orleans ! I can say nothing here of the officers and men individually ; but no doubt full justice will be done to all by the official report of the Commodore. 

I give the above facts, being myself an eye-witness to the events of the two days, and glad that I live to write you. 

The success attending the Californians in their fight with Captain Mervine at San Pedro, and afterwards with General Kearney at San Pasqual, made them 
very bold and arrogant; and every man of us was determined to retrieve, if possible, the credit of the American arms in this country. Yours, &c.
