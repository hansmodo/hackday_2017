[ Instructions sent to Commodore Sloat, and received by Commodore Shubrick in February, 1847, and not communicated to Commodore Stockton. ]

UNITED STATES NAVY DEPARTMENT, 

Washington, July 12, 1846. 

COMMODORE: Previous instructions have informed you of the intention of this government, pending the war with Mexico, to take and hold possession of California ; for this end, a company of artillery, with cannon, mortars, and munitions 
of war, is sent to you in the Lexington, for the purpose of co-operating with you according to the best of your judgment, and of occupying, under your directions, 
such post or posts as you may deem expedient in the Bay of Monterey, or in the Bay of San Francisco, or in both. In the absence of a military officer higher 
than captain, the selection of the first American post or posts on the waters of the Pacific, in California, is left to your discretion. 

The object of the United States is, under its rights as a belligerent nation, to possess itself entirely of Upper California. 

When San Francisco and Monterey are secured, you will, if possible, send a small vessel of war to take and hold possession of the port of San Diego ; and it 
would be well to ascertain the views of the inhabitants of the Puebla de los Angeles, who, according to information received here, may be counted upon as 
desirous of coming under the jurisdiction of the United States. 

If you can take possession of it, you should do so. The object of the United States has reference to ultimate peace with Mexico; and if, at that peace, the 
basis of the uti possedetis shall be established, the government expects, through your forces, to be found in actual possession of Upper California. 

This will bring with it the necessity of a civil administration. Such a government should be established, under your protection; and, in selecting persons to 
hold office, due respect should be had to the wishes of the people of California, as well as to the actual possessors of authority in that province. 

It may be proper to require an oath of allegiance to the United States from those who are intrusted with authority. 

You will also assure the people of California of the protection of the United States. 

In reference to commercial regulations in the ports of which you are in actual possession, ships and produce of the United States should come and go free of duty. 

For your further instruction, I enclose to you a copy of confidential instructions from the War Department to Brigadier-General S. W. Kearney, who is 
ordered, overland, to California. You will also communicate your instructions to him, and inform him that they have the sanction of the President. 

The government relies on the land and naval forces to co-operate with each other in the most friendly and effective manner. 

After you shall have secured Upper California, if your force is sufficient, you will take possession and keep the harbours on the Gulf of California, as far down, 
at least, as Guaymas; but this is not to interfere with the permanent occupation of California. 

A regiment of volunteers, from the State of New York, to serve during the war, have been called for by the government, and are expected to sail from the 
first to the tenth of August. This regiment will, in the first instance, report to the naval commander on your station, but will ultimately be under the command of General Kearney, who is appointed to conduct the expedition by land. 

The term of three years having nearly expired since you have been in command of the Pacific squadron, Commodore Shubrick will soon be sent out in the Independence to relieve you. 

The department confidently hopes that all Upper California will be in our hands before the relief shall arrive. Very respectfully, 

George Bancroft. 

COMMODORE JOHN D. SLOAT, 

Commanding United States naval forces in the Pacific Ocean.
