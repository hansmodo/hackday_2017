YOURS by Mr. Williams I have received. The little 
bill must be paid, but I confess it alarms me a little. 
The expense of my son here is greater than I ever 
imagined. Although his company is almost all the 
pleasure I have in life, yet I should not have brought 
him if I had known the expense. His expenses, together with what you have drawn for, and a little collection of books I have bought, will amount to more 
than will ever be allowed me. My accounts must 
not be drawn into intricacy or obscurity. I must not 
be involved in suspicions of meddling in trade, or any 
thing else but my proper business.

You complain that I don t write often enough, and 
that when I do, my letters are too short. If I were 
to tell you all the tenderness of my heart, I should 
do nothing but write to you. I beg of you not to be uneasy. I write you as often and as much as I ought. 
If I had a heart at ease, and leisure enough, I could 
write you several sheets a day, of the curiosities of this 
country. But it is as much impossible for me to think 
of such subjects as to work miracles. Let me entreat 
you to consider, if some of your letters had by any 
accident been taken, what a figure would they have 
made in a newspaper, to be read by the whole world ? 
Some of them, it is true, would have done honor to 
the most virtuous and most accomplished Roman matron ; but others of them would have made you and 
me very ridiculous. In one of yours you hint that I 
am to go to Holland. But I think you must be misinformed. By all that I can learn, some gentlemen 
intend to vote for me to Holland vs. Mr. D. ; others 
to Spain vs. Mr. Lee. Neither, I think, will succeed ; 
and therefore I think I have but one course to steer, 
and that is, homewards. But I can determine nothing 
absolutely. I must govern myself according to the 
intelligence which may hereafter arise, the orders of 
Congress and the best judgment I can form of my 
own duty and the public good.

I am advised to take a ride to Geneva, or to <a href='/results.php?city=amsterdam' rel='city'>Amsterdam</a> ; and I have been so confined from exercise, having never been further from Paris than Versailles since 
my arrival here, that some such excursion seems necessary for my health ; yet I cannot well bear the thought 
of putting the public to an expense merely for the sake 
of my pleasure, health or convenience. Yet my situation here is painful. I never was in such a situation 
before as I am now, and my present feelings are new 
to me. If I should return, and in my absence any 
orders should arrive here for me to execute, in that 
case nobody would be here to execute them, and they 
might possibly fail of success for want of somebody 
with power to perform them ; at least, this may he 
suspected and said and believed. However, upon the 
whole, as Congress have said nothing to me good or 
bad, I have no right to presume that they mean to 
say anything, and therefore, on the whole, it is my 
duty to return by the first opportunity, unless I should 
receive counter orders before that occurs. If ever 
the time should arrive, when I could have a little lei 
sure and a quiet mind, I could entertain you with ac 
counts of things which would amuse you and your 
children. There are an infinity of curiosities here, 
but so far from having leisure to describe them, I have 
found none even to see them, except a very few.

The climate here is charming. The weather is 
every day pleasant as the month of May ; soft, mild 
air ; some foggy days, and about ten or twelve days 
in January were cold and icy. But we have had 
scarce three inches of snow the whole winter. The 
climate is more favorable to my constitution than 
ours. The cookery and manner of living here, which 
you know Americans were taught by their former ab 
surd masters to dislike, is more agreeable to me than 
you can imagine. The manners of the people have 
an affection in them that is very amiable. There is 
such a choice of elegant entertainments in the theatric way, of good company, and excellent books, 
that nothing would be wanting to me in this country 
but my family and peace to my country, to make me 
one of the happiest of men. John Bull would growl 
and bellow at this description. Let him bellow if he 
will, for he is but a brute.
