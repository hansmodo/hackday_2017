The undersigned, Commander-in-Chief of the Department, has had advice from various sources, that the boats of the American ship of war Portsmouth, now anchored in San Francisco, 
go about the bay armed for the purpose of examining its trade, and as in the opinion of the undersigned, the aforesaid ship cannot practise such acts in a port which belongs to the Mexican 
nation, he addresses himself to the commander of the aforesaid ship, to the end that he will please inform him, in reply, with what object he takes those measures; that, in consequence, he 
may act in conformity with his orders from his Government.

The undersigned has the honor to repeat to the commander of the aforesaid ship assurances of his most respectful consideration. 
God and Liberty.
