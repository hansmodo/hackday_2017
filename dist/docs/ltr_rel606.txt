<p><i>[Biographer's note: My father was still very busy with his college work, and, after
establishing her there, spent most of the time in Lexington, riding
Traveller over to see her whenever he could get a spare day.  Among
the few letters preserved of those written to her at this time, I have
a note of July 16th: ]</i></p><p>

My Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse met">Mary</a>:  I am glad to see by your letter of yesterday that you
are recovering so well from your fall.  I hope you may soon be well
again....  Caroline [the cook] got back this morning.  Left her daughter
better.  Says there is a very good girl in Lynchburg, from General
Cocke's estate, anxious to live with us.  I shall have more conversation
with her [Caroline], and, if satisfied, will write for her, by the
boat to-night.  Her father is in Lynchburg, and anxious for her to
come....  Tell Mrs. Cabell I am sorry to have missed seeing her.  Where
is Katie?  I wish she would send her to see me.  I will endeavour to
find some one to carry this to you.  Love to all.
</p><p>
          Very affectionately and truly yours,
</p><p>
