It is said that you have landed a mile below. We must all be stationary till morning. Send to me by return of this boat, Mr. Hays, with five 
hundred in twenty post notes, and fifty dollars in silver. 
</p><p>
We will endeavor to start all the heavy boats at an early hour in the morning : those below are to wait till those above shall come down. A 
gun will be fired as a signal for moving. All is well, very well, at this garrison.

Your friend,

P. S. Mr Elliot has handed me some money. The silver is necessary, if it can be come at, and about three hundred dollars of paper. Hays need not come.
