CAMP PALO ALTO, 
January 27, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>. 
</p><p>
Our camp takes its name from the battle field which 
is but a few miles distant. Near us was the first 
pitched battle of the war; when, and where, will be 
the last ? Quien sabe? The better we have become 
acquainted with the people and the Mexican character, 
the more assured we all feel that the course pursued 
by our government is only calculated to protract the 
war. Proud, overbearing, ignorant, superstitious, and 
cruel in the extreme in their own wars, they do not in 
the least comprehend our temporizing forbearance. 
If, from the moment of invasion, instead of paying 
them two prices for everything our army wanted, we 
had laid waste their country, taking their horses, 
mules, herds, and crops, as they might have been 
required, leaving the sufferers to seek indemnification 
from their own government; if, instead of extend 
ing kindness and protection to the inhabitants, we 
had carried fire and sword into the heart of their 
country; if, instead of sending commissioners to treat 
asking for peace, and offering millions to make it, 
we had done all in our power to distress and harass 
them, treating them as a nation with contempt, they 
would not have thought as they now do, that we 
feared them; that the Whig party in our country 
were opposing the war, and about to leave the Executive without the means to prosecute it. They would 
have felt that they had no hope but in the successful 
operations of a campaign opposed to the entire 
strength of the United States. What their prospects 
would have been in such a case, their leaders and 
statesmen well know, and I believe that peace on 
advantageous terms would have been offered. Now 
we must fight it out with but little hope of a termination of the struggle in many years. ... A few words 
in apology for my journal. It has been written from 
day to day with a stump of a pencil, often on my knee 
in my tent at night after a fatiguing march, when I 
was cold, weary and disgusted with everything in 
this miserable world. There is scarcely a line of 
interest in it. However, I send it knowing that you 
will value it though it is unfit for any other eye, - 
but perhaps at some future day it will serve to recall 
scenes to my mind which otherwise would be forgotten. 
Do not let your partiality induce you to believe it is 
fit for general perusal. . . .

[Fragments from the continuation of the journal up to 
February i.J 
</p><p>
I am on a General Court Martial for the trial of 
Lieutenant A - and such other prisoners as may 
be brought before it. The court sits without regard 
to hours, everything being ordered to be dispatched 
rapidly to get the division ready to embark for parts 
unknown. ... In court today from nine o clock in 
the morning until five in the afternoon. . . . Orders 
were received today (January 31) from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> 
for the division to embark as soon as practicable 
on the transports. The fleet under convoy to as 
semble under the lea of the Island of Lobos. I do 
not know its position with any certainty, but am told 
it is about one hundred miles to the north of Vera 
Cruz. 
</p><p>
February i. Lieutenant Ritchie of our regiment, 
it is reported, has been cut off by the enemy. He 
was bearing dispatches from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a>, and was lassoed. Thus all the plans 
of the campaign have been obtained by the enemy. 
The first command under Brevet Lieu tenant- Colonel 
Childs was ordered to Brasos last evening to embark. 
They are for special service. The mail arrived today 
and we hear that the Army Bill has passed extra 
majors and all excluding the lieutenant-general ! 
Our prospects in the army, I think, grow more gloomy 
every day. Not only does peace seem to be more 
distant, but when it does come we are in danger of 
being disbanded. I almost envy the old and disabled 
officers, and sometimes almost wish that a respectable 
wound would enable me to quit the field. I should 
like to spend the remnant of my days in the bosom of 
my beloved family, in the quiet of some neat country 
place raising my own cabbages a la Van Buren ! 
What a picture my fancy paints, never, alas, to be 
realized ! I must still go on in my thankless and 
perilous profession. I ought not, however, to com 
plain. For twenty years I have worn the sword with 
out facing an enemy. A few years of war will only 
fit me for a respectable old age, or put to rest my 
unquiet spirit forever. 
</p><p>
February j. The rest of the Eighth Infantry 
arrived this morning so that the entire division is 
now ready to embark. This afternoon a violent north 
wind has been blowing and it is growing cold very fast. 
It will be almost insupportable before morning. We 
cannot embark till the wind moderates. I am field 
officer of the day, and am shivering in my tent over 
a pan of coals, having to sit up this cheerless night, 
at least until a late hour. I have just visited the long 
chain of sentinels around this camp. The night is 
gloomy and nothing breaks the silence of the sleeping 
army but the wolves which are howling in the immediate neighborhood. . . . 
</p><p>
February 4. We are still lying in Camp Palo Alto 
and I see no immediate prospect of our departing. 
The weather is boisterous and it is impossible to embark on this coast except in a calm. There is no har 
bor and it is at all times a difficult and dangerous 
operation for vessels of heavy draught. The large 
transports are anchored in the offing and the troops 
and baggage are necessarily put on board by small 
steamers. The coast is straight, the shore gradually 
shelves off to deep water and in the most quiet times 
there is a heavy ground swell. There is a report in 
camp today, which from its source is entitled to some 
credit, that a detachment of eighty volunteers with 
Cassius M. Clay and two majors, whose names I do 
not know, has been captured near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a>. . . . 
</p><p>
February 5. The Eighth Infantry left for the mouth 
of the river this morning. My old friend, Colonel N. 
S. Clarke, has joined his regiment and assumed command of the camp. We are informed by an order that 
but little transportation will be furnished after leaving 
the vessels so that we must reduce our baggage to the 
minimum. The design evidently is to push us lightly 
equipped and in the most rapid manner in pursuit of 
the enemy, in the hope of finding him unprepared, 
a vain expectation in my opinion. I believe Santa 
Anna knows well what we are doing, and I shall be 
agreeably surprised if we do not meet a large army in 
the neighborhood of Vera Cruz. Neither do I believe 
San Juan or the city will fall without a desperate re 
sistance, nor do I believe the Mexicans will make 
peace with us when we have taken those places. Two 
months will show. Hope and pray for the best. . . . 
There is confirmation today of the reported capture 
of C. M. Clay. The two majors were Gaines and 
Borland of the Kentucky cavalry. The disaster 
occurred at a spot called Encarnacion. They were 
entirely surrounded and did not fire a gun. 
</p><p>
February 6. Today the report has a new phase. 
It is said that Clay and Gaines are not prisoners, - 
only Major Borland is with a much smaller party than 
at first reported. You will think I only make state 
ments one day to contradict them the next, but Dame 
Rumor leads us astray and I only record each night 
what I believe. Young Ritchie of our regiment, 
whose sad fate I have mentioned, was a most amiable 
youth. The particulars of his death have reached us 
today. With his escort of Dragoons he arrived at a 
small place called Villa Rosa, halted his party in the 
skirt of the village, and alone (dreadful imprudence) 
went in for refreshments. After supping, he left the 
house and had proceeded but a few steps when a lasso 
was thrown over his head, he was drawn into a yard 
and killed with his own sword. His body was found 
a day or two after by Captain Graham of the Dragoons. . . . 
</p><p>
February 8. The Fourth Infantry under Colonel 
Garland left here this morning and will probably embark at Brasos tomorrow. We have not been notified 
who will go next, if it is our regiment we shall 
leave early in the morning as we hear several ships 
are now in the offing. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> has been much 
annoyed at the delay. The vessels ought all to have 
been here more than a fortnight ago. Such an error 
may possibly defeat the entire object of the expedition, be it what it may, for none of us know with 
certainty, though it is evident that dispatch and surprise are among its principal elements. The weather 
is now delightfully warm. Merrill and I took a fine 
swim in the river before dinner. Can you realize 
amid your frost and snow that I am bathing without 
discomfort in the Rio Grande ? . . . Nearly three 
weeks delay here must be enough to madden General 
Scott. Corporal Riley of my company lost his young 
est child this morning, about a year old. I went to 
his tent before noon and found the mother, an excellent little woman whom he married at Dearborn 
Arsenal, sitting with her dead baby in her lap, the 
tears quietly dropping on its face. ... A ridiculous 
story is in the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a> Flag of today that 
Santa Anna and Arista have had a quarrel in which 
Santa Anna was killed. I mention it as it will be 
quoted in the newspapers. It is undoubtedly all 
" buncombe." . . . We have just heard that a transport having on board four companies of Louisiana 
volunteers has been wrecked below Tampico. It is 
feared that they have been taken prisoners and Colonel 
De Renssy with them. Thus this expedition has be 
gun in delay and disaster. I trust it is no type of its 
ending. . . . 
</p><p>
February 14. The order to embark came this eve 
ning. Our heavy baggage is on board the boat which 
will take us to the mouth of the river, our camp 
breaks up at daylight. As we are the last detachment 
we shall probably get on board our transport by day 
after tomorrow, and proceed at once to the rendezvous 
at Lobos. . . . 
</p><p>
February 15. Our camp broke up at three o clock 
this morning and in the good steamer " Rough and 
Ready " we reached this place, Boca del Rio Grande, 
at eleven in the morning. Our camp is pitched upon 
the seashore, the ever beating surf in all its beauty 
is scattering its foam over the beach within a few feet 
of my tent, while over the broad Gulf as far as the 
eye can reach are anchored vessels of every size, from 
the light schooner, with its raking masts, to the 
mighty man-of-war whose heavy spars and black hull 
are barely visible as they roll on the main far out at 
sea. About us are the tents of more than two thousand troops, light artillery, cavalry, rifles, infantry, 
all bound for the great scene towards which we are 
looking with anxiety. 
</p><p>
February 16. Last night I had no idea we would 
leave Boca del Rio for twenty-four hours, but I was 
roused after a restless night at an early hour this 
morning by Major Scott s orderly, and on reporting 
to the Major I was informed that the regiment was 
to march to Brasos Santiago and that as the transport 
ship designated for the Fifth would carry but four 
hundred rank and file, the remainder were to be left 
to compose a portion of a battalion to be formed from 
the disjecta membra of the army. I declined the 
honor, and remonstrated against being detailed to 
command this portion, and Scott l insisted. I referred 
the matter to the next higher authority, Colonel 
Harvey, stating that if it was a higher command than 
that ordinarily bestowed upon a captain, it belonged 
to Merrill, the acting major of the regiment, and 
if less than a captain s command, Major Scott had 
no right to degrade me, that from the roster it could 
not be my detail as I was last on detached service 
commanding the escort from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a> to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>. 
It was decided in my favor, and Rossell was detailed 
for the service. We marched at two in the afternoon. 
Our route lay immediately on the beach each wave 
dashing around our ankles as we moved over the 
damp sand on the margin. We crossed Boca Chico, 
the strait which separates Brasos St. lago from the 
mainland, on a foot bridge carrying our baggage by 
hand and reloading in other teams on the other side. 
This was a tedious and laborious process detaining 
us two hours. The whole march was nine miles and 
we arrived at Brasos St. lago just at sunset. We are 
to embark early in the morning, if there is no norther, 
on the ship "Huron," seven hundred tons, which is an 
chored some five or six miles seaward. We heard this eve 
ning from Tampico Colonel De Renssy with his little 
battalion escaped from General Coz who surrounded 
him with a large force after his shipwreck. Colonel 
De Renssy held the Mexicans at bay, though the 
arms of his troops, if they had any, must have been 
unserviceable, and at night, leaving large camp fires, 
gave them the slip arriving by a forced march safely 
at Tampico. . . . There is a report tonight that 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> has had a severe fight, the particulars 
and result not known. . . .
