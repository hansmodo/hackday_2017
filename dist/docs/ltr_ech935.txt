My Own Dear Ellen:--After waiting with impatience for several weeks at the express office, I received your
letter of July 14th. The contents of my letter must indeed have been of a character far different from what I intended, to produce such a state of mind. To say that I never intended to write a line that would make you unhappy is unnecessary. Although I was then much disappointed at not hearing from you, I have no recollection of a single sentence wherein I accused you of neglect. Yes, dear Ellen, my feelings towards you have changed. Changed, if possible, to more ardent love. The longer I am absent and the further I am from you, the stronger my attachment becomes.
</p><p>
A letter from any one is always welcome, but you cannot imagine with what joy a person far from home and friends in a land where civilization gives way to a rude and savage life, receives a letter from the object nearest his heart on earth, written with her own hand and bearing her own sweet signature. It is a pleasure to look at it without reading, but when we come to read her own tender words, then our happiness is great beyond expression.
</p><p>
Clint has changed his tune from 'O, California, that's the land for me' to 'O, West Chester gals, ain't you coming out tonight?'
</p><p>
Advise me to stay and try my luck another season, and in a year from now I promise to be with you. Or beneath the waves of the ocean, or my bones bleaching on the plains, if Providence should so will it.
</p><p>
It is now growing late and I join you in a petition to the Almighty that He may extend His protecting hand over us, while I remain your trusting and faithful lover,
</p><p>
