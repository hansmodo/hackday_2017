<a rel='month origin' value='4'>April</a> <a rel='day origin' value='22'>22d</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=chester' rel='city origin'>CHESTER</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. This yellow Confederate quire of paper, my journal, blotted by entries, has been buried three days 
with the silver sugar-dish, teapot, milk-jug, and a few spoons and forks that follow my fortunes as I wander. 
With these valuables was <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood's</a> silver cup, which was partly crushed when he was wounded at Chickamauga. 
</p><p>
It has been a wild three days, with aides galloping around with messages, Yankees hanging over us like a 
sword of Damocles. We have been in queer straits. We sat up at Mrs. Bedon's dressed, without once going to bed 
for forty-eight hours, and we were aweary.

Colonel Cadwallader Jones came with a despatch, a sealed secret despatch. It was for General Chesnut. I 
opened it. <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a>, old Abe Lincoln, has been killed, murdered, and <a href='/results.php?tla=wls' rel=''>Seward</a> wounded! Why? By whom? It is simply maddening, all this. 
</p><p>
I sent off messenger after messenger for General Chesnut. I have not the faintest idea where he is, but I know 
this foul murder will bring upon us worse miseries. Mary Darby says, " But they murdered him themselves. No 
Confederates are in Washington. " " But if they see fit to accuse us of instigating it li Who murdered him ? Who 
knows? " " See if they don't take vengeance on us, now that we are ruined and can not repel them any longer"
</p><p>
The death of <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a> I call a warning to tyrants. He will not be the last President put to death in the capital, 
though he is the first.

Buck never submits to be bored. The bores came to tea at Mrs. Bedon's, and then sat and talked, so prosy, so 
wearisome was the discourse, so endless it seemed, that we envied Buck, who was mooning on the piazza. She rarely speaks now.
