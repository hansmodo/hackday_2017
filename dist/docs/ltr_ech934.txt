My Dear 'Old Dad':--Your welcome letter of August 4th reached me a few days since. The reason
you did not receive anything from me by the previous mail is because the mail was put in charge of an irresponsible agent and never reached New York, or at least not as soon as it should. I am happy to tell you Clint has improved greatly in health and now weighs more than myself.
</p><p>
I cannot yet say that I regret coming here for I believe I can and will make some money before I leave, yet I have learned a lesson which I can never forget, and it would be well for others if they could learn it without the experience I have had. If you get the ' blues' at any time and feel dissatisfied with your situation, think of the thousands who are not doing half as well as yourself.

I should like to know who that stranger is in town who resembles me so much. Tell me if he has as fine a proboscis upon his countenance as I have, and this will decide the question.

Yesterday I received a copy of the Record of July 16th, the only one I have seen since I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Everything seemed so familiar. I read it from 1st to 4th page, advertisements and all. I have been unable to get them brought up, but better arrangements are now being made and I hope to receive them regularly.
</p><p>
Please hand the enclosed to Miss Apple.
