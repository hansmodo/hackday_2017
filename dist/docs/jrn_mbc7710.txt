<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='3'>3d</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. Hetty, the handsome, and Constance, the witty, came ; the former too prudish to read Lost and Saved, 
by Mrs. Norton, after she had heard the plot. Conny was making a bonnet for me. Just as she was leaving the house, 
her friendly labors over, my husband entered, and quickly ordered his horse. It is so near dinner, I began. But 
I am going with the President. I am on duty. He goes to inspect the fortifications. The enemy, once more, are with 
in a few miles of Richmond." Then we prepared a lunch eon for him. Constance Gary remained with me.

After she left I sat down to Romola, and I was absorbed in it. How hardened we grow to war and war's alarms ! 
The enemy's cannon or our own are thundering in my ears, 
and I was dreadfully afraid some infatuated and frightened friend would come in to cheer, to comfort, and interrupt me. Am I the same poor soul who fell on her knees and prayed, and wept, and fainted, as the first gun boomed 
from Fort Sumter ? Once more we have repulsed the enemy. But it is humiliating, indeed, that he can come 
and threaten us at our very gates whenever he so pleases. If a forlorn negro had not led them astray (and they 
hanged him for it) on Tuesday night, unmolested, they would have walked into Richmond. Surely there is horrid 
neglect or mismanagement somewhere.
