UNITED STATES SENATE, 
</p><p>

Dear Brother: ... I can see how naturally you 
spoke of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jed rel="adversary">Jeff. Davis</a> as you did, and you did not say a 
word more than he deserved. Still he scarcely deserves 
to be brought into notice. He was not only a conspirator, but a traitor. His reply was a specimen of impotent rage. It is scarcely worth your notice, nor should 
you dignify it by a direct rejoinder. A clear, strong 
statement of the historical facts that justified the use of 
the word "conspirator," which you know very well how 
to write, is all the notice required. Do not attempt to 
fortify it by an affidavit, as some paper says you intend 
to do, but your statement of the letters seen by you and 
the historical facts known by you are enough. I have 
had occasion, since your letter was received, to speak to 
several senators about the matter, and they all agree 
with me that you ought to avoid placing the controversy 
on letters which cannot now be produced. The Records 
have been pretty well sifted by friendly rebels, and 
under the new administration it is likely their further 
publication will be edited by men who will gladly shield 
Davis even at the expense of a Union soldier. The 
letter of Stephens to Johnson is an extraordinary one. 
Its publication will be a bombshell in the Confederate 
camp. I will deliver the copy to Colonel Scott tomorrow. One or two paragraphs from it go far to sustain your stated opinion of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jed rel="adversary">Jeff. Davis</a>. . . . 
Very affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jos" rel="me">John Sherman</a>.
