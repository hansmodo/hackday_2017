<p>
TO DR. FRANKLIN.

Sir,--Whatever expectations might have been raised from the sense of
past favours, the goodness of the United States to me has ever been
such, that on every occasion it far surpasses any idea I could have
conceived. A new proof of that flattering truth I find in the noble
present, which congress has been pleased to honour me with, and which
is offered in such a manner by your excellency as will exceed
everything, but the feelings of an unbounded gratitude.
</p><p>
In some of the devices I cannot help finding too honourable a reward
for those slight services which, in concert with my fellow soldiers,
and under the god-like American hero's orders, I had the good fortune
to render. The sight of those actions, where I was a witness of
American bravery and patriotic spirit, I shall ever enjoy with that
pleasure which becomes a heart glowing with love for the nation, and
the most ardent zeal for its glory and happiness. Assurances of
gratitude, which I beg leave to present to your excellency, are much
too inadequate to my feelings, and nothing but such sentiments can
properly acknowledge your kindness towards me. The polite manner in
which <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague friend met'>Mr. Franklin</a> was pleased to deliver that inestimable sword, lays
me under great obligations to him, and demands my particular thanks.
</p><p>
With the most perfect respect, I have the honour to be, &c.
