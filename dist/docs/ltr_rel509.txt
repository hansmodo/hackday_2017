Camp at Valley Mountain, August 9, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1861">1861</a>.
</p><p>
I have been here, dear Mary, three days, coming from Monterey to
Huntersville and thence here.  We are on the dividing ridge looking
north down the Tygart's river valley, whose waters flow into the
Monongahela and South towards the Elk River and Greenbriar, flowing
into the Kanawha.  In the valley north of us lie Huttonsville and
Beverly, occupied by our invaders, and the Rich Mountains west, the
scene of our former disaster, and the Cheat Mountains east, their
present stronghold, are in full view.

The mountains are beautiful, fertile to the tops, covered with the
richest sward of bluegrass and white clover, the inclosed fields
waving with the natural growth of timothy.  The inhabitants are few
and population sparse.  This is a magnificent grazing country, and all
it needs is labour to clear the mountain-sides of its great growth of
timber.  There surely is no lack of moisture at this time.  It has
rained, I believe, some portion of every day since I left Staunton.
Now it is pouring, and the wind, having veered around to every point
of the compass, has settled down to the northeast.  What that portends
in these regions I do not know.  Colonel Washington [John Augustin
Washington, great-nephew of General Washington, and Mt. Vernon's last
owner bearing that name], Captain Taylor, and myself are in one tent,
which as yet protects us.  I have enjoyed the company of Fitzhugh
since I have been here.  He is very well and very active, and as yet
the war has not reduced him much.  He dined with me yesterday and
preserves his fine appetite.  To-day he is out reconnoitering and has
the full benefit of this rain.  I fear he is without his overcoat, as
I do not recollect seeing it on his saddle.  I told you he had been
promoted to a major in cavalry, and is the commanding cavalry officer
on this line at present.  He is as sanguine, cheerful, and hearty as
ever.  I sent him some corn-meal this morning and he sent me some
butter--a mutual interchange of good things.  There are but few of your
acquaintances in this army.  I find here in the ranks of one company
Henry Tiffany.  The company is composed principally of Baltimoreans--
George Lemmon and Douglas Mercer are in it.  It is a very find company,
well drilled and well instructed.  I find that our friend, J. J.
Reynolds, of West Point memory, is in command of the troops immediately
in front of us.  He is a brigadier-general.  You may recollect him as
the Assistant Professor of Philosophy, and lived in the cottage beyond
the west gate, with his little, pale-faced wife, a great friend of
Lawrence and Markie.  He resigned on being relieved from West Point,
and was made professor of some college in the West.  Fitzhugh was the
bearer of a flag the other day, and he recognised him.  He was very
polite and made inquiries of us all.  I am told they feel very safe
and are very confident of success.  Their numbers are said to be large,
ranging from 12,000 to 30,000, but it is impossible for me to get
correct information either as to their strength or position.  Our
citizens beyond this are all on their side.  Our movements seem to be
rapidly communicated to them, while theirs come to us slowly and
indistinctly.  I have two regiments here, with others coming up.  I
think we shall shut up this road to the Central Railroad which they
strongly threaten.  Our supplies come up slowly.  We have plenty of
beef and can get some bread.  I hope you are well and are content.
I have heard nothing of you or the children since I left Richmond.
You must write there....  The men are suffering from the measles, etc.,
as elsewhere, but are cheerful and light-hearted.  The atmosphere,
when it is not raining, is delightful.  You must give much love to
daughter and 'Life' [Pet names for his two daughters, Mary and Mildred].
I want to see you all very much, but I know not when that can be.  May
God guard and protect you all.  In Him alone is our hope.  Remember
me to Ned [M. Edward Carter Turner, of Kinloch, my father's cousin]
and all at 'Kinloch' and Avenel [The house of the Berbeleys, in
Fauquier County].  Send word to Miss Lou Washington [Eldest daughter
of John Augustin Washington] that her father is sitting on his blanket
sewing the strap on his haversack.  I think she out to be here to do
it.

Always yours,
