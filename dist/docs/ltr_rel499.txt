My dear Mary:  I received last night your letter of the 1st, with
contents.  It gave me great pleasure to learn that you are all well
and in peace.  You know how pleased I should be to have you and my
dear daughters with me.  That I fear can not be.  There is no place
that I can expect to be but in the field, and there is no rest for
me to look to.  but I want you to be in a place of safety....  We
have only to be resigned to God's will and pleasure, and do all we
can for our protection....  I have just received Custis's letter of
the 30th, inclosing the acceptance of my resignation.  It is stated
that it will take effect April 25th.  I resigned on the 20th, and
wished it to take effect that day.  I cannot consent to its running
on further, and he must receive no pay, if they tender it, beyond
that day, but return the whole, if need be....
