Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received the letter, which you did me the honor to 
write to me on the 8th instant, as also the papers accompanying it. 
</p><p>
I shall give the Council an account of the punishable (punissable) conduct of their agent in the United States, and I 
can assure you, beforehand, that they will regard the strange 
abuse of their confidence by this agent, as I do, with the liveliest indignation. The President of the United States has 
done justice to our sentiments, in attributing the deviations of 
the citizen Genet to causes entirely foreign from his instructions ; and we hope that the measures, which are to be taken, 
will more and more convince the head and the members of 
your government, that so far from having authorised the proceedings and criminal manoeuvres (les demarches et les man&ucrlminelles) of citizen Genet, our only aim has been 
to maintain between the two nations the most perfect harmony. 
</p><p>
I shall avail myself, Sir, of the medium of the packet boat, 
which brought to you the despatches of <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel=''>Mr Jefferson</a>, and I 
pray you to give me notice of the day which you have fixed 
for its departure. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.
