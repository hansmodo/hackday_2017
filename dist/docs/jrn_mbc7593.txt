<a rel='month origin' value='8'>August</a> <a rel='day origin' value='24'>24th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. Daniel, of The Examiner, was at the President's. Wilmot de Saussure wondered if a fellow did 
not feel a little queer, paying his respects in person at the house of a man whom he abused daily in his newspaper.

A fiasco: an aide engaged to two young ladies in the same house. The ladies had been quarreling, but became 
friends unexpectedly when his treachery, among many other secrets, was revealed under that august roof. Fancy

Mr. Lowndes said we have already reaped one good result from the war. The orators, the spouters, the furious 
patriots, that could hardly be held down, and who were so wordily anxious to do or die for their country they had 
been the pest of our lives. Now they either have not tried the battle-field at all, or have precipitately left it at their 
earliest convenience : for very shame we are rid of them for a while. I doubt it. Bright's speech is dead against us. 
Reading this does not brighten one.
