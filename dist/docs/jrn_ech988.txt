Wednesday evening, the horizon being clear toward the east, we had a fair view of the Tetas Mountains (Three Tits) on the island of Chiloé about seventy to eighty miles distant, but an unfavorable wind rendered it necessary to tack ship every few hours without making much progress on our course. Next day it rained the whole afternoon and considerable water was caught. A vessel was discovered early in the morning more than twenty miles ahead of us and going the same way. Being a faster sailer than she, we came up to her about eight in the evening and soon showed her our stern. Judging by the number of boats she carried we supposed her to be a whaler. We have seen several whales.

We have been successful in catching four porpoises, or sea-hogs, and they furnished several meals of fresh meat all around. Two others were likewise harpooned, but owing to their strength and agility in the water succeeded in escaping from us only to be devoured by their fellows. The first was harpooned through and through and yet it was found very difficult to get him out of the water. This fellow was about five feet long, and would weigh from 100 to 150 pounds, of a dark brown color on the back, and perfectly white belly. This species is different from that found in the Atlantic and is
known as the whale porpoise. Their jaws are shaped somewhat like a hog's and are thickly studded with a row, on each side, of teeth like shoe pegs. The meat is of a dark red color, and resembles horseflesh very much, besides being oily. It is first boiled in salt water and then fried in pork fat and flour. We eat it with a hearty relish as I believe we would relish anything in the fresh meat line after so long an abstinence.

Within the last few days, all the birds that have been following in our wake have disappeared, excepting the Cape pigeons, or devil birds.

Without any employment and a continual sameness, time hangs heavily on all hands. Cards have lost their charm and a party can scarcely be raised to take a game. Drunken frolics, which were very popular for a short time, have also failed, for the bottle is empty and the spirits cannot be raised. The newspapers, books and novels have all been read and discussed, and nothing seems to remain for us to do but sit down and brood over our ills, which is well-calculated to breed discontent. But now as we approach port, we all have more or less correspondence to post up, and thus many of us find some little employment.
