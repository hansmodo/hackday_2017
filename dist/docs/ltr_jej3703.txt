Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The Medical department was under the consideration of a Committee before I left Congress, and Yill, 
it is probable, undergo a change that may curtail the 
number of the present appointments. Should this be 
The case, and the new arrangement take place before 
I return (which at present is my intention to do 
before Christmas), I shall recommend to the support 
of The Virginia Delegates the gentlemen you have 
been pleased to mention, whose long services and well known characters entitle them to be among the first 
officers in the establishment. 
</p><p>
If I am not mistaken, the spirit of party is much 
abated in Congress. Some instances of the old prejudices and partialities that disgraced and must ever 
disgrace their counsels, I think I have discovered; 
but they are few, and I entertained hopes that the 
flame was nearly extinguished. And, although some 
restless tempers, as some there are and ever will be 
in public assemblies of men, may attempt to revive 
those disputes which were carried to such height between the contending factions, as to neglect the more 
important concerns of the public, there are, I trust, 
a sufficient number of mild spirits who will oppose 
and repress such dishonorable attempts, and confine 
themselves to the discussion alone of such matters as 
justice and the general welfare require. I am certain the important objects now before Congress are 
sufficient to engage their attention and employ their 
time, without perplexing themselves by a revival of 
old and expiring controversies.

It was with reluctance I left <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> before 
the report upon your letter respecting the army and 
magazines was complete, and the arrangements of the 
civil offices of Congress were digested; but an apprehension that the Assembly was to meet the first 
Monday in October, as usual, and a desire of spending a short time with my family before I went to 
<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, determined me to set out so as to reach 
home about the middle of September. I now find I 
might have staid a fortnight longer, as the session 
does not commence until the third Monday in this 
month. 
</p><p>
Congress having taken some steps towards completing the Federal Union, which I anxiously wish to 
accomplish, induced me to be here early in the session, that the sense of this State upon that interesting question might be taken; that, if the proposition 
was approved, it might be divulged to other States 
without delay ; and Virginia, being more interesting. 
than any other in a cession of unappropriated territory, the example would not fail to have weight, and 
be followed by others. We are already too large for 
the energy of republican government ; and, I fear, 
shall still be so, if the Assembly shall relinquish their 
claim to the north-west of the Ohio to the Continent. 
I wished, too, to be able to be present the beginning 
of the session, to urge the filling up our battalions 
immediately, and providing magazines in time, as the 
ensuing winter to the south and the approaching 
spring to the north, if our ally shall command the 
water, might afford us favorable opportunities of acting to advantage. But, alas ! instead of the French 
commanding the water, we have the mortification to 
hear Rodney, with twelve ships of the line and four 
frigates, has arrived at the Hook. Where, for God's 
sake, is Count de Guichen, with his great and formidable fleet ? Surely, not inactive.

Adieu. Yours, &c.,
