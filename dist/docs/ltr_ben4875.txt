DEAR Son: I have received yours of Oct. 4, 8, and 13. 
I cannot imagine what became of my Letter of Aug' 3 from 
May Place. It was, however of no great Importance. Mr. Denonnandie is gone this Day to Geneva. I gave him a 
Letter of Recommendation to a Friend there. 
</p><p>
I am persuaded that your Packets were not open'd at the 
Office; for tho' a Secretary of the State has the Power of 
ordering Letters to be opened, I think it is seldom used but 
in times of War, Rebellion, or on some great publick Occasion, and I have heard they have Means of copying the Seal 
so exactly, as that it cannot be discovered that the Letters 
have been look'd into. 
</p><p>
It is plain therefore, that whoever rubb'd your Packets 
open, had not the Use of such Means. And yet as you are 
satisfy'd it was not done on your Side the Water, I suspect 
the Letter-Carrier might be corrupted and the Business done 
between the Office in Lombard Street and my House. When 
a Packet arrives, a special Messenger goes directly from the 
Office with the publick Letters before the Sorting is finished. 
Mine has been sometimes sent by the same Messenger, 
who calPd on me in his Way to Lord H.'s, sometimes in his 
Return, and as he told Mr. Strahan that his Letters to you 
were often return'd to me from America, and yours to him sent 
thro' my Hands to be seen he supposed by me before Delivery ; 
and since his Resignation your Packets do not appear to have 
suffered the least Violation, I fancy the Rubbing them open 
may possibly have been the Ingenuity of Mr. Sec Knox. 
By the List you have sent me I find none of the Papers 
missing. Another Circumstance in favour of this Opinion 
is, that no Letters to me were thus abused but yours and those 
from the Assembly of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. This I think clears the Person you suspected, and rather fixes the above Conjecture. 
</p><p>
I have not seen your Speech at the Opening of your last 
Session, but I hear it has been commended by the Ministry. 
</p><p>
I return Mr. Foxcroft's Letters as you desire. I make no 
Remarks on the Reports he mentions. I know not who is 
meant by the Hero of your Speech. Nor will I say more at 
present of the Ohio Affair, than that it is not yet quite secure, 
and therefore I still advise Discretion in speaking of it. 
</p><p>
Dr. Price has been so good as to give me his Opinion of 
your Scheme, which I send, hoping it may be of Use; I 
suppose that you have his Book, referred to in the Paper. 
Some Acknowledgment or Thanks should be sent him for 
the Trouble he has taken. 
</p><p>
I continue very well, Thanks to God. On Monday last 
I was chosen into the Council of the Royal Society for the 
4th time. Our Friend Sir John Pringle was elected President, 
which is very agreable to him. 
</p><p>
I shall send you a Tea-Urn by the first Ship. I just now 
hear that the November Packet is arrived, so I stop here till 
I receive the Letters that come by her. [These words are 
crossed out in the record, apparently in the same ink.] 
</p><p>
Just now comes to hand yours of Nov. 3, whereby I find 
mine of Aug. 3 is received. I am glad to learn that you and 
your neighbouring Governors are so sociable. I shall communicate what you write about the Virginia Grants. At 
present I can only add that I am, with Love to Betsey, 
Your ever affectionate Father, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
