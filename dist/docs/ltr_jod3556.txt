MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YOUR letter of the 23d Has made me the happiest 
man upon earth. I am twenty years younger than I 
was yesterday. It is a cruel mortification to me that 
I cannot go to meet you in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, but there are a 
variety of reasons decisive against it, which I wilt 
communicate to you here. Meantime I send you a 
son who is the greatest traveller of his age, and with 
out partiality, I think, as promising and manly a 
youth as is in the whole world. He will purchase a 
coach, in which we four must travel to Paris. Let it 
be large and strong, with an imperial and accommodations for travelling. I wish you to see the <a href='/results.php?city=hague' rel='city'>Hague</a> 
before you go to France. The season is beautiful 
both here and in England. The journey here will be 
pleasant, excepting an hour or two of sea-sickness between Harwich and Helvoetsluys. You may come 
conveniently with your two children and your maid 
in the coach, and your man may ride on horseback 
or in the stage coach. 
</p><p>
I can give you no counsel about clothes. Mr. Puller will furnish the money you want upon your order 
or receipt. Expenses I know, will be high, but they 
must be borne, and as to clothes for yourself and 
daughter, I beg you to do what is proper, let the expense be what it may. Every hour to me will be a 
day, but don t you hurry or fatigue or disquiet your 
self upon the journey. Be careful of your health. 
After spending a week or two here, you will have to 
set out with me to France, but there are no seas between, a good road, a fine season, and we will make 
moderate journeys, and see the curiosities of several 
cities in our way ; Utrecht, Breda, Antwerp, Brussels, 
&c. &c. It is trie first time in Europe that I looked 
forward to a journey with pleasure. Now, I promise 
myself a great deal. I think it lucky that I am to 
go to Paris, where you will have an opportunity to 
see that city ; to acquire its language, &c. It will be 
more agreeable to you to be there than here, perhaps, 
for some time. For my own part, I think myself 
made for this world. 
</p><p>
Yours, with more ardor than ever,
