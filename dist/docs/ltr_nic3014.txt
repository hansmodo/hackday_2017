SIR, 
</p><p>
The necessity, which caused the unexpected evacuation of Long Island, hath alarmed the General Assembly of this State, as it seems that communications 
cannot be kept open with an island where the enemy's ships can approach. This hath filled us with 
apprehensions for the town of Newport and the Island 
of Rhode Island, which are of so great importance to 
this and the other United States. Upon which the 
Assembly have thought proper to appoint John collins, Joshua Babcock, and Joseph Stanton, Esqs., a 
Committee to wait upon your Excellency, to acquaint 
you with the state of this Government, and to confer 
with you upon the best measures to be taken for its 
defence, and with respect to the Island of Rhode Is 
land. I beg the favor of your Excellency to treat 
them with the most entire confidence ; and have no 
doubt but that the same disposition which hath always induced you to manifest your regard to this 
State, will induce you to give us your best advice 
and assistance. 
</p><p>
Upon receiving information of the landing of the 
enemy upon Long Island, and a letter from Governor 
Trumbull, acquainting us with your request that a 
body of men might be thrown upon the east end of 
that Island, this State ordered the whole brigade, with 
the two galleys, and a sufficient quantity of provisions 
and ammunition, to proceed to that Island, and ordered them to be replaced by the militia of the State. 
We exerted ourselves to get them in readiness; and 
some of them were under orders to proceed, when 
we received the most uncertain and aggravated accounts of the evacuation of Long Island, which occasioned us to stop the men until we could receive 
intelligence to be depended upon ; which we did not 
gain until the last evening. I beg leave to observe 
to your Excellency the advantages that may accrue 
to the common cause from the several States having 
early and authentic intelligence of all matters of importance that shall happen, and to request your Excellency to favor us with accounts of every thing 
material. I have the honor to be, with every sentiment of esteem and respect, Sir, your Excellency's 
Most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
