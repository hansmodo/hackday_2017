Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
This will, I expect, accompany my last, of the twelfth 
instant, no opportunity having offered since it was written, I 
do myself the honor to enclose herein the copy of what I wrote 
on the nineteenth instant to <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun</a>, respecting an atrocious 
violation of our Flag, and respecting a very extraordinary step 
taken by the Convention in the repeal, on the motion of a 
member, of the decree by which our ships were exempted 
from the seizure, to which those of others were exposed. I 
was informed that the object of the decree I complain of was, 
to effect the confiscation of a large cargo belonging to citizens 
of the State of South Carolina, and which has been some time 
since acquitted at Havre ; but an appeal was made from the de 
cision of the court, though grounded on the clearest principles. 
The captors then declared, that they would obtain a decree 
for the confiscation, by means of their friends in the Conven 
tion, and some time afterwards that of the ninth of May 
appeared, in which a retrospective clause covered precisely 
the object they had in view. Such a coincidence of circumstances was somewhat remarkable. However, I made no 
allusion to it in my first application, which, as you will have 
seen, produced the desired effect, being the decree of the 
twenty-third of May. The interested parties, as soon as this 
decree was passed, went to work, as I was afterwards 
informed, and by force of money, as my informant says, produced the decree of the twenty-eighth. Certain it is, that the 
former was not sent to be enregistered until after the latter had 
passed, and then both were immediately forwarded together. 
It did not become me to give ear to calumnious suggestions, 
nor yet could I be totally deaf to a matter of such general 
importance to the United States. You will perceive, in the 
close of my letter to <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun</a>, some general observations, 
which will render the corrupted members (if such there be) a 
little more cautious. I shall enclose herewith <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun's</a> 
answer of the twenty-first instant to mine of the nineteenth. I 
had directed Mr Coffyn, the agent at Dunkirk, to cause a 
prosecution to be commenced against the murderer of our 
fellow citizen. 
</p><p>
In a letter written long since, I mentioned to you, Sir, that 
I was in quest of Monsieur M. I have since found him and 
conversed with him. He is immensely rich, but seems to 
have been the father of his own fortune, amassed, as fortunes 
frequently are, without rendering the possessor respectable. 
If I can judge from his countenance, the inquiry was set on 
foot in the hope of negative answers, and the affirmative is, ofcourse, not pleasing. Certain it is, that he showed no inclination to spare to the necessities of his nephews a part of his own 
abundance ; but this is the less reprehensible, in that he treats 
himself no better than his needy relations. 
</p><p>
Your favor of the twentieth of April reached me two days 
ago, and now I have those of the eighth of that month, and 
twelfth and fifteenth of March. To the contents of the last 
mentioned letter, I shall pay all due attention, whenever 
opportunities can be found or made for the purpose. I am 
happy to find, by what you say in the beginning of yours of the 
twelfth of March, that your sentiments accord so entirely 
with those, which I had the honor to express in mine of the 
twenty-second of August, and that the conduct, which I had 
thought it proper to pursue, is thereby justified. My corres ondence with Mr Short will have shown you, Sir, that I have 
been very far from questioning the principles which you state, 
and I perfectly agree, that there is little difficulty or embarrassment in the application of clear principles, when the facts are 
clear. 
</p><p>
But while events are doubtful, the feebleness of human 
foresight may, I hope, be pardoned for hesitating, where things 
of vast moment depend on the steps to be immediately taken. 
A man of eminence in the late revolution, and who has since 
left France, urged me much to go away shortly after the tenth 
of August. As I had not, and have not, any reason to question, either on my own account, or on that of my country, the 
sincerity of his advice, I could only examine the ground of his 
judgment, which has always been esteemed a good one. We 
differed in opinion ; but this sentiment he expressed strongly, 
In your case, said he, I would go to England or Holland, 
and from thence state the existing facts, and ask my Court to 
decide on my conduct, without waiting for future events. As 
it was clear from hence, that his reflections turned principally on my personal situation, I told him that my conduct would be 
influenced by considerations totally different ; and, therefore, 
conceiving it to be most conducive to the interests of the United States, I should stay. 
</p><p>
In the present moment, you will observe, Sir, by the public 
papers, that a majority of the departments declare themselves 
against the authority of the present Convention, after the arrestment of their fellow members, just as in the month of June 
last, a similar majority declared their execration of the at 
tempts on Louis the Sixteenth. But who will venture to tell us 
what August is to produce ? No small part of France is in 
open war with the rest; and wherever the insurgents arrive, it 
appears that the whole country is friendly to them ; so that, if 
one were to judge by what passes in that quarter, France 
would be nearly unanimous in the re-establishment of royalty, 
should they come in force to Paris. Then the established principle of administration would undoubtedly be, that all which 
has been done within the last year was an abominable usurpation, &LC. &ic. And without questioning our principles of government, they might dissent from the application of them, by the 
subtle distinction between the voice of a nation, and what would 
then be called the voice of a faction. Under circumstances 
of this sort, I am particularly happy to have received your orders, which I shall implicitly obey. Accept, I pray you, 
my sincere thanks for having given them so opportunely. 
</p><p>
I will apply to the Minister for the orders you wish respecting payments to our citizens, and I make no doubt that they 
will be transmitted. -And, indeed, I should suppose that if, 
without such orders, the payments were made by the treasury 
of the United States, the government of this country (let what 
ever government may be established) would allow the justice 
of a deduction to the amount from what we owe. It is possible that we may hereafter have occasion to insist on that principle, among other reasons, because of the plundering of our 
ships, of which complaints are daily made to me; and which 
the present government of this country is too feeble to prevent. 
</p><p>
Doubtless there are many things of the sort, which do not 
come to my knowledge ; for, in some cases, the masters and 
crews, being taken out of the American ships and put on board 
the privateers, are carried very far from where their vessels 
arrive, and put on shore where chance directs or circumstances 
permit ; and, as many of the privateers are taken by British 
cruisers, some of our citizens may find their way to England, 
and some to the British colonies and foreign possessions. 
</p><p>
I am very happy to find that it has been in the will, and in 
the power of the United States, to make advances for the colony of St Domingo, and also to send supplies of bread to this 
country. On the 27th of September I mentioned to you the 
plan of a speculation, on drafts to have been made on the United 
States, could my concurrence have been procured. Events 
have shown that this speculation would have been a good one 
to the parties, who would have gained, (and the French nation, of course, have lost) about fifty thousand pounds sterling, 
in less than eighty thousand. I was informed at that time, that 
the disappointed parties would attempt to have me recalled, and 
some more tractable character sent, who would have the good 
sense to take care of his own interest. Well, Sir, nine months 
have elapsed, and now, if I were capable of such things, I 
think it would be no difficult matter to have some of them 
hanged. Indeed, it is highly probable that they will experience a fate of that sort. It is a year ago, that a person, who 
mixed in tumults to see what was doing, told me of a Sans 
Culotte who, bellowing against poor Lafayette, when Petion 
appeared, changed at once his note to vive Petion, and then 
turning round fc) one of his companions; Vois tu ! C est notre 
ami, n est ce pas ? Eh bien&gt; ilpassera comme les autres. And 
lo ! the prophecy is fulfilled ; and I this instant learn that Petion, confined to his room as a traitor or conspirator, has fled, on 
the twenty-fourth of June, <a href='/results.php?year=1793'>1793</a>, from those whom he sent, on 
the twentieth of June, <a href='/results.php?year=1792'>1792</a>, to assault the King in the Tuile.ries. In short, you will find in the list of those, who were ordered by their brethren to be arrested, the names of those who 
have proclaimed themselves to be the prime movers of the 
revolution of the tenth of August, and fathers of the Re 
public. 
</p><p>
I am hurt and vexed at the delay of my letters. By what 
you say of the advices you had received on the eighth of April, 
mine, down to the thirteenth of February, ought to have reached you by that time ; and, indeed, notwithstanding the length 
of winter passages, there was room enough for their arrival. 
But the mischief arises from the ports where vessels are put 
up, as to sail on one day named, and some four or five weeks 
after, we learn that they are still detained. 
</p><p>
I have not yet received the plans of the federal town, which 
you were so kind as to send, which I am sorry for, because, if 
there is any part marked out for sale in Europe, I think, in 
the present critical moment, purchasers would be found. By 
the bye. I think a plan might be formed for purchasing land, 
and building houses there, by way of actions, but I shall not 
dwell thereon at present, and will write more fully about it, 
when I receive the plans and letters accompanying them. 
</p><p>
By the first very good conveyance which may offer, I will 
send out the dies you order. At present I have none such, 
and only time to write by the person who takes this with him, 
and who is to sail from Havre for New York. I would rather 
give them in charge to some one who is himself going over, for 
great neglects happen in the ports, as I know by frequent experience. 
</p><p>
Mr Pinckney has doubtless informed you long since, that 
Mr Droz declines going out to America. There was some 
misunderstanding on the subject, between him and Mr Short, 
which he entered into a long history of, and desired me to 
communicate it to you, for whom he expressed the utmost deference and respect. As I found it to be impossible to get him into the service of the United States, which was the main object, I thought it unnecessary to trouble you with a long chapter of little sorenesses, which were, I could clearly see, the effect of prudent caution in Mr Short, on the irritable delicacy 
of the Artist. I am sorry, however, for the thing, because the 
conversation I had with him, and the inquiries I made, lead 
me to believe that he would have been a very faithful and useful officer. 
</p><p>
The assurances you give in your letter of the twentieth of 
April, that our fellow citizens are disposed to preserve an ex 
act neutrality, give me sincere pleasure, as you will find from 
what I took the liberty to say on that subject in former letters. 
I fear that the frequent violations of our neutrality by the privateers, fitted out in the French ports, may provoke a change of 
sentiment. T labor incessantly to keep things quiet in that regard, and I think it likely that some of my countrymen may 
think me too much attached to France, because I do not enter 
into the violence of their resentments, for which there is, as 
you will see, more ground than I choose to acknowledge to 
them. 
</p><p>
How long the war may last I know not ; but this I know, 
that it is very much our interest not to be drawn into it. The 
new constitution, upon which, at present, I shall make no re 
marks, but send you a copy, may, if adopted with enthusiasm, 
be the means of lengthening out the struggle, in which case 
France, or rather the ruling party in France, might triumph 
over all opposition. Otherwise, it would seem, humanly 
speaking, that if there be a perfect accord between the different powers without, and the royalists within, this campaign 
must put an end to the whole affair. Yet who can answer for 
the contingencies of war and the fluctuations of opinion ? I 
have the honor to be, &c.
