          Headquarters, Army of Northern Virginia, April 10, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1865">1865</a>.
</p><p>
After four years' of arduous service, marked by unsurpassed courage
and fortitude, the Army of Northern Virginia has been compelled to
yield to overwhelming numbers and resources.  I need not tell the
survivors of so many hard-fought battles, who have remained steadfast
to the last, that I have consented to this result from no distrust
of them; but, feeling that valour and devotion could accomplish nothing
that could compensate for the loss that would have attended the
continuation of the contest, I have determined to avoid the useless
sacrifice of those whose past services have endeared them to their
countrymen.  By the terms of the agreement, officers and men can return
to their homes and remain there until exchanged.  You will take with
you the satisfaction that proceeds from the consciousness of duty
faithfully performed; and I earnestly pray that a merciful God will
extend to you his blessing and protection.  With an increasing
admiration of your constancy and devotion to your country, and a
grateful remembrance of your kind and generous consideration of myself,
I bid you an affectionate farewell.

                           <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="me">R. E. Lee.</a>, General.
