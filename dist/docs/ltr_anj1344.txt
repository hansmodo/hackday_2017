DEAR SIR: I have just received your message to both Houses of Congress, 
forwarded by you, and have read it with great attention and satisfaction. 
The Florida question being now fairly before Congress, I hope that body 
will take measures to secure our southern frontier from a repetition of massacre and murder. 
</p><p>
From the report of Col. King, received and forwarded to the Department 
of War, you will discover that the Indians had concentrated their forces on 
the Choctaw Hotchy, which gave rise to the affair between them and Captain 
Boyles, which Col. King reports. 
</p><p>
The collection of the Indians is said to have taken place at this point on 
their hearing that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pensacola" rel="city">Pensacola</a> was to be restored to Spain, and that the Indians have declared they will never submit to the United States. If this be 
the fact, and as. to myself I have no doubt, as soon as Spain is in possession 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pensacola" rel="city">Pensacola</a>, we may expect to hear pi a renewal of all the horrid scenes 
of massacre on our frontier that existed before the campaign, unless Captain 
Boyles, on his second visit, may be fortunate enough to destroy this operation, which you may rely springs from foreign excitement. 
</p><p>
Col. Sherburne, Chickasaw agent, requested me to name to you, that he 
was wearied with his situation, of which I have no doubt: his age and former 
habits of life but little calculated him for happiness amidst a savage nation. 
But being dependent for the support of himself and sister on the perquisites 
of his office, he cannot resign; but it would be a great accommodation to him 
to be transferred to Newport, should a vacancy in any office occur that he 
was competent to fill. I have no doubt but he is an amiable old man; and 
from his revolutionary services, I sincerely feel for him. He is unacquaint 
ed with Indians, and all business that relates to them; but at the treaty, as 
soon as he did understand our wishes and that of the Government, he aided 
us with all his might The Colonel never can be happy amidst the Indians. 
It would afford me great pleasure to hear that the Colonel was comfortably 
seated in an office in Newport, where he could spend his declining years in 
peace and happiness with his own countrymen and friends. 
</p><p>
Accept assurances of my high respect and esteem, and believe me to be, 
respectfully, your most obedient servant,
