DEAR SISTER:
</p><p>
On Monday next I start to take Jesse to school, and then for Pittsburgh
to attend the meeting of the "Society of the Army of the Cumberland." I
will be back about the last of the week. I would like you to make your
visit while I am at home, and want mother to come with you, as well as
Jennie and Mr. Corbin. If you have made no arrangements to start
earlier suppose you come say on Saturday week and bring the children
with you.
</p><p>
I am just in receipt of a letter from Mr. Corbin, and one from Mr.
Clark, asking me to attend the Fair next week. Please say to Mr. Corbin, and Mr. Clark too if you see him, that I had an invitation from
Senator Frelinghuysen to stay with him during the Fair which I had to
decline because I shall be absent during the week. The Army of the
Cumberland was the one commanded by General Thomas. They have their
reunions annually, to all of which I have been invited, but it has so
happened heretofore that I could not attend one of them. As I have
attended one or other of the Army Society meetings almost every year, I
feel it a duty to attend this one now and have informed them that I
will be present.
</p><p>
My kindest regards to all.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.

<p>
MRS. MARY G. CRAMER.
