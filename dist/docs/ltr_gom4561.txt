Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to write to you on the third of July, of 
which letter I now enclose a copy. I have patiently waited 
since that period for the answer, which had been promised on 
the twenty-first of May, to my letter of the thirtieth of April. 
Had any circumstance turned up, which would in my opinion 
have justified a new application, it should have been made ; 
but this has not been the case. 
</p><p>
You will have seen the declaration, and counter declaration, 
of the Spanish and British courts, exchanged at Madrid the 
twenty-fourth of last month. These leave the material ground 
of controversy in its original state, and the armaments go on 
with unremitting diligence. The event seems to turn upon 
the ability and inclination of France, whose condition is far 
from desirable ; but I shall not attempt to describe it, because 
I have no doubt that Mr Short, being on the spot, will transmit 
much better information than I can pretend to. The poor 
king of Hungary, pressed by Prussia, and distracted by the 
interior commotions of his various dominions, and unsupported 
by France, has been obliged to accede to terms of pacification, 
by no means desirable. This leaves Britain and her friends 
more at liberty to press the other powers. The proceedings 
of the congress have of course been very secret, and if they 
had not, a mere private individual in this country could not 
acquire an early knowledge of them. There is, however, one 
circumstance which, let things terminate as they may, will, I 
conceive, have considerable consequences. The king of Prussia has endeavored to obtain from Poland the cession of Thorn 
and Dantzic. These countries are, you know., already surrounded by his dominions, except towards the sea ; and if he 
had succeeded, or should succeed, he will not only become at 
once a naval power, but will hold in his hand the key to the 
great granary of Europe. This, at a period when from the 
extension of commerce and manufactures in other countries, 
the want of bread is often feared, and sometimes felt, will give 
him immense advantages both in peace and war, besides those 
of rendering his dominions more compact, and of increasing 
his revenue. It is, I think, hardly possible that Britain and 
Holland should have wished for his success, and if his failure 
should be owing to their resistance, it may at no distant period 
give rise to new connexions and alliances in the north. la 
the Baltic they have been very busy. The seasons give but 
little time there for any other naval war. than that which man 
must wage with the elements. They make therefore the best or, if you please, the worst use of their time. Little, however^ 
has been effected, except the havoc of the human race, which 
is not over numerous in that quarter. The king of Sweden, 
with infinite gallantry, places himself in situations where he 
can gain little, and may lose all. Hitherto he has extricated 
himself by downright fighting, and as it is too late for effectual 
interference from England or Holland, probably both sides, 
having sung Te Deum, will take breath, and may, perhaps, be 
content to try what negotiation can do next winter. 
</p><p>
I have little doubt but that the ministry here would have 
agreed to comply with the treaty of peace, had they found 
themselves engaged in a war, which they have been upon the 
brink of for some months ; and I presume, that in proportion 
as the clouds shall disperse, they will be less tractable. I have 
taken patience, and remained here, though I had many private 
reasons for going to the continent; but as I believed that by 
being on the spot, I might be useful, especially if a favorable 
occasion should offer, I thought it my duty to stay. 
</p><p>
From some circumstances, too slight to be worth mention 
ing, I incline to think that such occasion is not far distant ; but 
never, perhaps, were the affairs of Europe in a situation which 
admitted so little of forming any solid opinion ; and this from 
the spreading of what is called the French disease, in other 
words, revolt. Hungary, part of Germany, Italy, and Savoy, 
with France and Flanders, are already in different stages of 
that disease. Poland is constitutionally afflicted with it. In 
Sweden and Holland slight circumstances would bring for 
ward seeds, which have long been sown, and no man can tell 
or even guess how far it may extend, or what may be the 
consequences. This country is free from the contagion, and 
likely to continue so. Indeed the English seem in some respects to have changed sentiments and manners with the French. 
They are as far gone in loyalty as their neighbors in republicanism. Happy America, where alone, I verily believe, both 
freedom and virtue have their real and substantial existence
</p><p>
I wait with anxious expectation to hear what congress may 
have done in relation to this country, as well as upon the important subject of finance ; for that also would have no small 
influence on the British cabinet. Having long been in the habit 
of contemplating public credit as the most certain and abundant 
national resource, they will naturally, and indeed necessarily, 
take up their opinion of us on that ground. And if at the same 
time their mercantile interest should fed that we have a government, it might produce a general conviction that we are not to be 
trifled with. Incidental circumstances among foreign nations 
may give us momentary advantages, and doubtless it is the duty of all public servants to watch those moments, and turn them 
to the best account. But it is by the solidity of our domestic 
system alone, that we can become permanently and intrinsically respectable. Consequently, it is by that alone, that we can 
hope for permanent and useful connexions. And although we 
ought not from such considerations to become supine or inattentive to the measures of the greater maritime powers, which 
would indeed be very imprudent, yet we may certainly repose 
with greater confidence on the good faith of others, when they 
see, and above all when they feel the value of our friendship. 
</p><p>
I pray your kind excuse, sir, for giving vent to these ideas, 
which are as much the sentiments of my heart as the dictates 
of my understanding. As conclusions of reason, they have naturally been adopted by every thinking man in America ; but 
he must come out of it, perhaps, if he would have their importance deeply impressed by the impulsion of daily experience. 
I am, &tc.
