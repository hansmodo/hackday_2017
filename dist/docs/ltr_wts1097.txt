My Dear Sister : The wind is now so strong and fair 
that we have hopes of reaching <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=valparaiso" rel="city">Valparaiso</a> in about ten 
days, and, as our stay there will be too short to gratify 
curiosity and write letters too, I must prepare them beforehand. We sailed from Eio on the evening of the 21st of 
September, and ran down the coast of South America 
with nothing to disturb the usual monotony of a sea life 
till, on the twenty-first day out, we made Statenland, an 
island to the north and east of Cape Horn. It had 
become cold, and the bleak mountains, covered with 
snow, looked desolate enough. Soon they were sunken 
beneath the horizon, and our vessel felt the majestic 
swell of the Pacific. We were then in the sea so much 
dreaded by sailors, but a bright sun made us for the 
day think the dangers like most others, more imaginary 
than real. We were soon undeceived, for the southwest 
wind arose, driving us to the eastward amidst a conflict 
of waves such as I had never seen before. For twelve 
days we struggled with the storm, snow, ice, and cold, 
and when the wind lulled, we found that no progress 
had been made. A favoring breeze then enabled us to 
reach Cape Horn, with its snow-capped rocks, and we 
passed quite near it, with a clear sky and bright sun overhead. We began to flatter ourselves that it was done 
with us, but we were again mistaken ; for a northwester 
began and served us more rudely than its predecessor. 
For another twelve days it was one continued struggle for 
mastery, and really it seemed more than once as though 
the ship must be swamped. All hands were completely 
exhausted ; our Captain Baily of the navy has made the 
passage some ten or twelve times, and the purser still 
oftener, and each say they never encountered so heavy 
a sea or such persevering head gales. Often our decks 
were covered with ice and snow, the rigging dangling 
with icicles, whilst the wind moaned and whistled as in 
our western woods. I will not attempt to give you an 
idea of the height or force of the waves, words are 
inadequate to convey a true idea, and one must experience them to feel their full force. I trust, however, 
you may never have to seek such experience. Yesterday, however, the observation of the sun placed us in 
54 40' or north of Cape Horn, whose latitude is 55 59', 
or we had been twenty-six days south of the Cape passing through a distance we might return in less than two. 
Our course on the chart is jagged and crooked enough ; 
the farthest south latitude we made was 59. Here it 
is now spring and the days very long. I have seen the 
sun rise before four in the morning and set after eight, 
with twilight extending nearly the whole night. Were 
we to remain here a month longer, we might see the sun 
throughout twenty hours out of twenty-four. Travellers 
always allude to the strangeness of seeing the sun to 
the north, new constellations in the sky, etc., but education explains causes, removes mystery, and strips travelling of nearly all its ancient zest. The constellation of 
the Southern Cross is composed of four stars that are 
not very conspicuous. You may look up any night and 
see the same in any latitude. The Magellan clouds are 
three small patches of nebulae like the Milky Way. 
They are near the South Pole, and cannot, of course, be 
seen in the northern hemisphere. In no other respect 
does this part of the world differ from any other, for the 
sea, monotonous sea, is the same everywhere, differing 
only according to the freshness of the breeze. The little 
world, bounded by the walls of our ship, continues the 
same limited monarchy, with its grades and distinctions. 
The captain in his cabin, the officers in the wardrooms, 
and sailors and soldiers forward. Of the three, ours, 
being the middle rank, is doubtless the most pleasant, 
for it embraces eleven in number, with books, cards, and 
music. We are thrown into the most intimate contact, 
and thus far have not suffered from a feeling of jealousy 
that is very apt to arise among officers of different services. Strange, too, for it is an imperium in imperio. 
We are passengers, having our soldiers under one species of command the naval officers are on duty with 
the sailors. We are bound to do nothing, but still do 
make one-fourth of our men stay on deck all the time 
to assist in working the ship, for the crew is very short. 
Such a mixture of duties seldom prospers, but here, by 
a good understanding on the part of the officers, we have 
had no trouble at all, all feeling our mutual dependence. 
Since we have been off the Cape it has been so cold that 
we have been compelled to wrap up and keep more to 
ourselves in our staterooms, sleeping or reading, the 
former having the preference the better the sleeper, 
the happier the man. Never was time more perfectly 
sacrificed, for we have been afloat near four months, and 
now, for the first time, we head towards our destination, 
after having sailed about nine thousand or ten thousand 
miles. If you hear about a subscription opening to dig 
a canal across the Isthmus of Panama, you may put me 
down any amount, for really I do not fancy a voyage of 
twenty-four thousand miles to accomplish a distance of 
less than two thousand. However, I do not permit myself to dream of a return to the United States for five or 
six years, when I hope to pass through Mexico. We are 
all most anxious to hear the state of the war. How 
many fights have been had, how the volunteers act, how 
General Kearny progresses, for we expect him to be in 
California this winter ; yea, and a thousand other things 
that will be old before they reach our ears, for our own 
slow progress teaches us how slow and uncertain is communication by sea, to which we shall have mainly to 
rely for news and letters. The long, tedious time on 
board ship has given us ample time to reflect upon the 
past and make me feel a little astonished at my rapid 
movement from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburgh" rel="city">Pittsburgh</a>. There I was well off, but, 
impelled by a feeling of shame at leading so quiet a life 
when my comrades were at war, I wrote to the AdjutantGeneral, requesting him to order me upon any expedition, the more hazardous, the more it would be to my 
liking. This letter was before him when Captain Tompkins, without my knowledge, made application for me. 
The coincidence produced the result, and I was ordered. 
My order reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburgh" rel="city">Pittsburgh</a> when I was absent of my 
own accord, so that when I reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburgh" rel="city">Pittsburgh</a> I found 
that the expedition would sail immediately; I started 
without regard to private risk or interest lest I should 
be too late and lose a reputation for prompt and willing 
obedience of dangerous orders. I wish now I had been 
more slow and made better preparations for so long an 
absence, but it is now too late and I must trust to fortune. I repeat these things that they may be known in 
case of accident to me. ... I cannot imagine now how 
I was so hasty at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburgh" rel="city">Pittsburgh</a>, except that then I had an 
idea that we were to land in California to act offensively 
with a battery instead of being planted to grow rusty 
and old in one place till Government be good enough to 
recall us. The only objects of life and curiosity in this 
region of earth are the whales and birds ; the former do 
not show themselves often, but are known by the peculiar 
misty spout of water made as they rise to the surface for 
breath ; but the birds are seen in a clearer element ; they 
crowd in flocks all around the ship, following it for days 
and weeks, pouncing upon every piece of pork or bread 
that is thrown overboard. This greediness makes them 
an easy prey, for, with a baited hook and line, they are 
easily caught, and I don't know when I have had a more 
hearty laugh than at the simple idea of fishing for birds ; 
but the idea is now a fact, having myself caught of all 
kinds. The most peculiar of them is the Cape pigeon, 
a beautiful, innocent bird exactly like a tame pigeon, 
except that it sits the water like a duck, and has webbed 
feet; but the albatross, the huge bird of the Cape, is 
more to my liking, and seems so perfectly indignant at 
being caught by stratagem. There are of these several 
varieties, the gray, the quaker (color) and white; the 
latter is the largest, measuring as much as twelve feet 
from wing to wing ; their bodies are white and as large 
as a swan, and the spread of their wings great indeed. 
They soar about, scarcely moving a feather, just above 
the surface of the water, and, let the sea be as agitated 
as possible, they rise and fall with the huge waves, 
moving along them like a spirit upon the face of the 
waters. To the soldier officers catching these birds, 
the sailors, ever superstitious, attribute our hard luck 
in passing the Cape. . . .

We expected to have reached port ere this, but the sea 
is very uncertain, giving us a foul wind instead of fair ; 
but now a strong south wind is carrying us straight 
towards Valparaiso. Already are they shortening sails, 
ready to lay to for morning, as soon as the lighthouse is 
made. It is Sunday, and the day has been remarkably 
beautiful ; sailors, soldiers, and officers have crowded the 
spar deck to enjoy the warm sun and watch the varying 
shades of the distant Andes. They are distinctly visible, 
their sides and caps shining in their wintry garb, whilst 
the dark line of green at their base adds beauty to their 
cold, sterile magnificence. These mountains are from 
seventeen to twenty-two thousand feet in height, and 
may be seen at the distance of one hundred and fifty 
miles ; but so accustomed have I been to read accounts 
of them and to see and dream pictures of snow-clad 
mountains, that these seem more like a representation 
than reality. I hope, however, to stroll as high up as 
possible, so as to realize all their magnitude and enjoy 
the splendid scenery grouped around them. Sixty-four 
days have now elapsed since we sailed from Rio, and you 
can easily conceive our anxiety to reach port. . . . There 
is a large fleet of English in harbor, but it seems that 
they have taken no steps to oppose our taking California. 
A lieutenant called upon our captain from the usual 
mark of politeness. I am officer of the day, and cannot 
go on shore, but will have the next three days to myself ; 
then again I'll be officer of day, and will write to mother. 
Good-by. Your affectionate brother, 
</p><p>
