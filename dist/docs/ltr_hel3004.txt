SIR, 
</p><p>
My last trouble to your Excellency was dated the 
30th ultimo, by Rosse. The present will cover an 
act of that date for ascertaining the rank and pay 
annexed to Brevet commissions. Whether this is, or 
is not, intended to have a retrospective effect, I think 
is not clearly expressed by the letter ; and, as I apprehend such operation may, in many instances, give 
umbrage, I shall embrace the first proper opportunity 
of obtaining an explanation of the act, or information 
to my own understanding. 
</p><p>
I despatch this messenger principally to inform 
your Excellency of an event, the knowledge of which 
may nevertheless very probably have reached camp that body I have, therefore, commended your desire, and with it havo 
lodged the copies you sent. 
</p><p>
" Had proposals of this kind been properly and sincerely made by 
the Court of Britain to the Supreme Authority of America, before 
the wanton cruelty which has marked the progress of the British 
arms in this country had taken place, or prior to our declaring ourselves independent, and entering into allians with foreign powers, 
they would have been accepted with sentiments of gratitude. But at 
this time, all proposals, except for a peace upon honorable and equal terms, must be ineffectual." 
</p><p>
Copies of the same Bills were sent to <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel=''>Governor Trumbull</a> by Governor Tryon from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. The following extracts are from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel=''>Governor Trumbull</a>'s answer. 
</p><p>
" Your letter of the 1 7th instant, from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, is received, with 
its inclosures, and the several similar packets of various addresses 
with which it was accompanied. 
</p><p>
"Propositions of peace are usually made from the supreme authority of one contending power to the similar authority of the other; 
and the present is the first instance, within my recollection, where a 
vague, half-blank, and very indefinite draft of a Bill, once only read 
before one of three bodies of the Legislature of a nation, has ever 
been addressed to the people at large of the opposite power, of an 
before this can arrive there, as our messenger from 
France, Mr. Simeon Deane, had spoken, everywhere 
on his journey to <a href='/results.php?city=york' rel='city'>York</a>, of the treaties between the 
Court of Versailles and the United States of Ame 
rica, which were executed on the 6th of February. 
<a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. These were read in Congress late last evening, and will probably be ratified and published in 
the course of the present week, except a secret article, which it is also probable is very well known 
abroad. Be this as it may, I view the treaties of 
alliance and commerce, although not free from exception, as circumstances of advantage to these United 
States, and which afford a bottom for vast improvements. I beg leave, therefore, to congratulate with 
your Excellency, and with every friend to the great 
American cause. I shall move Congress, to-morrow, 
to order duplicates of the treaties to be immediately 
transmitted to your Excellency ; in the mean time 
this of a letter from Doctor Franklin and Mr. 
</p><p>
Deane, which will go inclosed, will communicate the 
great outlines. I have the honor to be, with the 
highest esteem and regard, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obliged and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
