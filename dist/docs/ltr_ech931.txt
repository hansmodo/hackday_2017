Betrothed Ellen:--This day a year ago, I little dreamed that in a twelvemonth I should have encountered the terrors of Cape Horn, and after many days of severe suffering, reached the shores of this golden land, and been penning you an epistle like this. But strange as this would have sounded then, it is now nevertheless true.
</p><p>
When we landed on the beach at Happy Valley, we pitched our tent and commenced life in true California fashion. Every evening the merry notes of the violin are heard, and judging from appearances the place is not inaptly named.
</p><p>
After our arrival, I received many letters and papers at the post office, and not seeing any in your handwriting, I impatiently tore the envelopes off Mr. Prizer's and therein found the precious documents so eagerly looked for. The words therein were a soothing balm to all misgivings, and assure me of your abiding and
unchanging love and affection, and should I return home without a dollar, I flatter myself that in you I would still possess a jewel more precious than all the glittering ore in this dazzling country, but I expect to return with a better hand than when I left or perish in the pursuit.
</p><p>
You speak with great earnestness of your anxiety for my future comfort and speedy return. I can assure you that thus far I have suffered many hardships to which I have been unaccustomed, but with the exception of a slight cold, consequent upon sleeping on the ground, I feel as well in health as ever I did in my life.
</p><p>
In order to perpetuate the good old custom of sending letters of love and friendship on St. Valentine's Day, I must write a short letter of friendship to Miss Hunter. Were you of a less generous disposition, I should hardly dare to tell you this, but I know you are not blinded by the foolish and jealous passions so often found in your sex. I know you will never allow yourself to be disturbed by the petty reports often found floating through the community and always added to by busy mischief-makers. But believe me, I would rather that the hand which now guides my pen should wither than deceive you in this. And if you feel the least disturbed on this account you can apply to me for a copy of this letter, which I will forward you if you desire it.
</p><p>
You mention that on one occasion Mr. Evans was talking with your father about me and gave me an excellent character. Now I wish you to inform me if your friends, particularly your father, mother and sister, are aware of our correspondence and engagement. The former I suppose they do know, but the latter I cannot tell, but you can. If they do know, what
is their opinion in regard to the subject; or if they are not aware of it, what do you think they would say if informed of the case? You say my daguerreotypeis kept in the parlor. I infer from this and from some other sentences that they are perhaps aware of the position we hold toward each other and am therefore anxious to know their opinion.
</p><p>
You and Cad must have had a merry time when you walked up to Miss Hoffinton's as Quakers. Give my compliments to Cad and tell her she had better not wait for the California boys; they may not get back very soon.
</p><p>
And some of your acquaintances think you have an investment in the California Stock. Well, if they consider me an investment it is even so.
</p><p>
You still rob yourself of much enjoyment, I fear, on my account, by not allowing yourself to walk with or attend parties with other acquaintances. If any expedition is on foot that promises enjoyment, I pray you accept the invitation on my account, for nothing can give me more pleasure than to know you are well and happy. I pray you also to abate your anxiety about me, for a continual weight upon the mind must eventually affect the system and undermine health.
</p><p>
Before I started and bid farewell to as good friends as ever lived, I counted the cost. I had strong and honorable motives for encountering the terrors of Cape Horn and the dangers of a long sea voyage and here, just on my arrival in the land of promise, would be a poor place indeed to regret the undertaking. No danger must be met half way, every difficulty should be met with manly fortitude, and my intention is to meet them in such a manner that I need never be ashamed. I now boldly turn my face toward the celebrated Sierra
</p><p>
Nevada. What we may there have to encounter, I cannot anticipate; perhaps we shall have to engage with the native Indian in some sanguinary and bloody conflict, or be hugged to death by the fierce and savage grizzly bear. But whatever may be my fate--should the worst come and I be fated to leave my bones to whiten on the bleak plains of this golden land, I can never forget the image that has been present to my mind's eye for so long a time.
</p><p>
I received a beautiful piece of poetry with your letter entitled, ''tis Sweet to Be with God!' I have read it with great interest but confess my inability to practice the good precepts contained therein.
</p><p>
In a few days we hope to leave for the diggings and what our opportunities may there be to receive or send letters, I know not, and should you not hear from me for a long time do not despair or think that I intentionally delay writing to you. We may have to penetrate the country many hundred miles, and if so of course our mail conveniences will be few, but what there are shall be embraced by me to write to you. I wish you to write monthly to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, and I will get your letters some time. Theodore and his party are at the Middle diggings, I believe, Thornbury at the same we are going to, but I fear we shall meet none of them. Remember me to your sister, and your parents. Although a stranger to Miss Hatch, please give my compliments to her also.
</p><p>
That happiness may be found in your footsteps is the prayer of your devoted
</p><p>
