I presume my dear Lucy would be disappointed, 
if her cousin did not deliver her a line from her 
aunt. Yet it is hardly fair to take up an exhausted 
pen to address a young lady, whose eager search 
after knowledge entitles her to every communication 
in my power. 
</p><p>
I was in hopes to have visited several curiosities 
before your cousin left us, that I might have been 
able to relate them to my friends ; but several 
engagements in the company way, and some preparation for his voyage, together with the necessary arrangements for our own journey, have so 
fully occupied me, that I fear I shall fail, in my intentions. We are to dine to-day with <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='friend met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>. 
Should any thing occur there worthy of notice, it 
shall be the subject of my evening pen. 
</p><p>
Well, my dear niece, I have returned from <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a>'s. When I got there, I found a pretty 
large company. It consisted of the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='acquaintance met'>Marquis</a> and 
Madame de la Fayette ; the Count and Countess 
de ; a French Count, who had been a general in America, but whose name I forget ; Commodore Jones ; Mr. Jarvis, an American gentleman, lately 
arrived, the same who married Amelia Broom, who 
says there is so strong a likeness between your 
cousin and his lady, that he is obliged to be upon his 
guard lest he should think himself at home, and 
make some mistake ; he appears a very sensible, 
agreeable gentleman ; a Mr. Bowdoin, an American 
also ; I ask the Chevalier de la Luzerne's pardon, 
I had like to have forgotten him ; Mr. Williams, of 
course, as he always dines with <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='friend met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> ; and 
Mr. Short, though one of <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='friend met'>Mr. Jefferson's</a> family, as 
he has been absent some time, I name him. He 
took a resolution that he would go into a French 
family at St. Germain, and acquire the language ; 
and this is the only way for a foreigner to obtain it. 
I have often wished that I could not hear a word of 
English spoken. I think I have mentioned Mr. 
Short before, in some of my letters ; he is about the 
stature of Mr. Tudor ; a better figure, but much like 
him in looks and manners ; consequently a favorite 
of mine. They have some customs very curious 
here. When company are invited to dine, if twenty 
gentlemen meet, they seldom or never sit down, but 
are standing or walking from one part of the room 
to the other, with their swords on, and their chapeau de bras, which is a very small silk hat, always 
worn under the arm. These they lay aside whilst 
they dine, but reassume them immediately after. 
I wonder how the fashion of standing crept in 
amongst a nation, who really deserve the appellation of polite ; for in winter it shuts out all the fire 
from the ladies ; I know I have suffered from it 
many times. At dinner, the ladies and gentlemen 
are mixed, and you converse with him who sits next 
you, rarely speaking to persons across the table, 
unless to ask if thev will be served with any thing 
from your side. Conversation is never general, as 
with us ; for, when the company quit the table, they 
fall into tete-a-tete of two and two, when the conversation is in a low voice, and a stranger, unacquainted with the customs of the country, would 
think that everybody had private business to transact. 
Last evening, as we returned, the weather being 
very soft and pleasant, I proposed to your uncle to 
stop at the Tuileries and walk in the garden, which 
we did for an hour ; there was, as usual, a collection of four or five thousand persons in the walks. 
This garden is the most celebrated public walk in 
Paris. It is situated just opposite to the river Seine, 
upon the left hand as you enter Paris from <a href='/results.php?city=auteuil' rel='city'>Auteuil</a>. 
Upon <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Neck, suppose that on one side flows 
the river Seine, and on the other hand is the garden 
of the Tuileries. There is a high wall next the 
street, upon which there is a terrace, which is used 
as a winter walk. This garden has six large gates, 
by which you may enter. It is adorned with 
noble rows of trees, straight, large, and tall, which 
form a most beautiful shade. The populace are not 
permitted to walk in this garden but upon the day 
of Saint Louis, when they have it all to themselves. 
Upon one side of this garden is the castle of the 
Tuileries, which is an immense pile of building, 
very ancient. It is in one of these chateaus, that 
the concert spirituel is held. Upon the terrace which 
borders this chateau, are six statues and two vases. 
These vases are large, circular spots of water, 
which are conveyed there from the Seine by leaden 
pipes under ground. Round the great vase, which 
is in the midst of the parterre, are four groups 
of white marble. One represents Lucretia ; the 
story, I know, is familiar to you. The Parisians do 
well to erect a statue to her, for at this day, there 
are many more Tarquins than Lucretias. She is 
represented as plunging the dagger into her bosom 
in presence of her husband. There is another 
statue, Anchises saved from the flames of <a href='/results.php?city=troy' rel='city'>Troy</a> 
by his son iEneas, who is carrying him out upon his 
shoulders, leading Ascanius, his son, by his hand. 
The third is the rape of Orithyia, the daughter of 
Erectheus, King of Athens, by Boreas ; and the 
fourth, the ravishment of Cybele bv Saturn ; the 
two last very pretty ornaments for a public garden. 
At the end of the great alley fronting the largest 
water-piece, which is in the form of an octagon, are 
eight more marble statues. Upon the right is Hannibal, counting the rings which were taken from the 
knights who were killed in the battle of Cannse. 
Two Seasons, Spring and Winter, are upon the left 
hand, and a very beautiful figure of Scipio Africanus, near which are the two other Seasons, Summer 
and Autumn, and a statue of the Empress Agrippina. 
Over against these are four Rivers, colossal, represented sleeping, the Seine, the Loire, the Tiber, and 
the Nile. At the end of the two terraces, are two 
figures in marble, mounted upon winged horses ; one 
is Mercury, and the other Fame, who, as usual, is 
blowing a trumpet. In very hot weather, the alleys 
are watered ; under the trees are seats and chairs, 
which you may hire to sit in for a sous or two. 
There are many plots of grass interspersed.

Thus, you see, I have scribbled you a long letter. 
I hope my description will please you. This is my 
eleventh letter, and I have yet several others to 
write ; so adieu, my clear Lucy, and believe me 
</p><p>
most affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
A. A.
