Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Some time last fall, when I spoke to your Excellency about going to the southward, I explained to 
you candidly my feelings with respect to military 
reputation, and how much it was my object to act a 
conspicuous part in some enterprise that might perhaps raise my character as a soldier above mediocrity. You were so good as to say you would be 
glad to furnish me with an occasion. When the expedition to Staten Island was on foot, a favorable 
one seemed to offer. There was a battalion without 
a Field-Officer, the command of which I thought, as 
it was accidental, might be given to me without inconvenience. I made an application for it through 
the Marquis, who informed me of your refusal, on two 
principles ; one, that giving me a whole battalion 
might be a subject of dissatisfaction ; the other, that, 
if an accident should happen to me in the present 
state of your family, you would be embarrassed for 
the necessary assistance. 
</p><p>
The project you now have in contemplation, affords 
another opportunity. I have a variety of reasons 
that press me to desire ardently to have it in my 
power to improve it. I take the liberty to observe 
that the command may now be proportioned to my 
rank, and that the second objection ceases to operate, 
as, during the period of establishing our winter-quarters, there will be a suspension of material business; 
besides which, my peculiar situation will, in any case, 
call me away from the army in a few days, and Mr. 
Harrison may be expected back early next month. 
</p><p>
My command may consist of an hundred and fifty 
or two hundred men, composed of fifty men of Major 
Gibbs's corps, fifty from Colonel Meigs's regiment, 
and fifty or an hundred more from the light infantry; Major Gibbs to be my Major. The hundred 
men from here may move on Friday morning towards 
, which will strengthen the appearances for 
Staten Island, to form a junction on the other side 
of the Passaic. 
</p><p>
I suggest this mode to avoid the complaints that 
might arise from composing my party wholly of the 
light infantry, which might give umbrage to the officers of that corps, who, on this plan, can have no 
just subject for it. 
</p><p>
The primary idea may be, if circumstances permit, to attempt, with my detachment, Bayard's Hill. 
Should we arrive early enough to undertake it, I 
should prefer it to any thing else, both for the brilliancy of the attempt, in itself, and the decisive consequences of which its success would be productive. 
If we arrive too late to make this eligible (as there 
is reason to apprehend), my corps may form the van 
of one of the other attacks; and Bayard's Hill will 
be a pretext for my being employed in the affair, on 
a supposition of my knowing the ground; which is 
partly true. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself, also, that my military character 
stands so well in the army as to reconcile the officers in general to the measure. All circumstances 
considered, I venture to say, any exception which 
might be taken would he unreasonable. 
</p><p>
I take this method of making the request, to avoid 
the embarrassment of a personal explanation. I shall 
only add, that, however much I have the matter at 
heart, I wish your Excellency entirely to consult your 
own inclination, and not, from a disposition to oblige 
me, to do any thing that may be disagreeable to you. 
It will, nevertheless, make me peculiarly happy if 
your wishes correspond with mine. I have the honor 
to be, very sincerely and respectfully. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
