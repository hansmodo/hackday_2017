SIR, 
</p><p>
You will perceive, from the inclosed resolves, that 
Congress, desirous of reenforcing the army at this 
critical period, have recommended to the States of 
Pennsylvania and New Jersey to order out immediately a considerable part of their militia; and I have 
no doubt of their compliance. 
</p><p>
I have wrote to Governor Livingston on the subject, and informed him that, should he think proper 
to appoint General Dickinson to the command of the 
three thousand requested from that State, it will be 
extremely agreeable to Congress. That gentleman 
has, I understand, signified his readiness to act when 
ever called upon; and, as he possesses the confidence 
of the militia, and has talents equal to the task, I 
am persuaded the appointment will give general satisfaction. 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 3d instant, and likewise of yesterday by the hands of <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel=''>General St. Clair</a>, I have been 
duly honored with. The latter I shall lay before 
Congress this morning. I have the honor to be, with 
the greatest respect, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
