TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE

No. 17 [EDMUND RANDOLPH]

This morning the Charge des affairs of Sardinia paid me a 
visit, and appeared to be exceedingly fearful of the events 
which a continuance of the present severe weather may 
produce. He said the Court and the States, he understood, 
were determined not to move from hence at any rate. That 
the ministers of Sweden and Denmark were resolved not 
to move, and those of the belligerent powers were in an 
embarrassing position, as their departure would have a bad 
effect upon the common cause, in the opinion which it 
would spread in public that the state of affairs is desperate, 
and their continuance here would expose them to be treated 
as enemies. That for his own part he should feel very much 
embarrassed in the predicament had he not recently received instruction in case of events to withdraw to England. That the Ministers of Sweden and Denmark had offered 
to receive and protect his movables that he could not carry off, 
but that he had rather lose all, than give an alarm by transporting his goods from his home. He therefore made me two 
proposals. First, that if I wished he would sell me his 
furniture and the lease of his house, which is at a low rent 
and would be convenient enough for me. The other, that I 
should take a simulated sale of them, and have the use of them, 
in order to cover the property ; that I should thereby render him 
a most important service. 
</p><p>
Though it would be extremely agreeable to me to perform 
any good office for one of my diplomatic brothers, which might 
tend to establish a claim to gratitude towards my country, yet 
I cannot conceive myself justified in any departure from the 
obligations of the severest neutrality for that purpose. 
</p><p>
Upon the second proposal, therefore, I could not hesitate 
a moment in forming my determination. 
</p><p>
As to the other, which would at the same time suit my 
own convenience, and comply with his wishes without in 
fringing in the minutest particular upon the rights of others, I told him I would think of it, and give him my answer to-morrow morning. 
</p><p>
Upon reflection however I have concluded to reject the whole, 
because if the events apprehended by him should really 
take place, I feel the importance of establishing the most 
unequivocal claim to all the regard, which the laws of 
nations in similar cases attribute to the character which 
I bear. American property to a large amount has already 
been put under my immediate protection, and it is not 
improbable that I may be under the necessity of using my 
exertions for the indemnity of much more. In order to 
retain in full perfection all the rightful means in my power 
to serve my own fellow citizens, if the occasion should require 
it, I see the necessity not only of avoiding every act but 
every cause of suspicion l that might tend to impair them. 
The measure, though perfectly innocent, would probably 
be observed, and might at least occasion doubts and jealousies which would weaken the confidence upon which the full 
possession of my neutral privileges may depend. 
</p><p>
These are only two among a considerable number of applications which are frequently made to me on either side of 
the warring parties, and wherein I find myself obliged to 
refuse what is asked of me as a favor. It is a disagreeable 
task to refuse offices of kindness, but I find it not less 
necessary than unpleasant. 
</p><p>
It seems from the conversation which I have just related, 
that the Swedish and Danish Ministers offer without scruple 
to cover property liable to the laws of war, nor do they think 
[it] necessary to be secret in pursuing this conduct. It will 
no doubt give them opportunities to render most essential services, and may entitle them to gratitude which is a good instrument in the hands of a negotiator. 
</p><p>
I, too, by this singular concurrence of circumstances have 
this advantage in my power, and have no doubt but I might 
easily make myself very busy in the use of it. It might be 
useful ; I will not say it would be unjust. It is not, I think, 
expedient. I have, etc.
