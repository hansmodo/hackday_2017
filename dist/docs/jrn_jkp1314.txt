On yesterday official despatches were received from Col. Price, commanding at Santa Fé, announcing that a battle had been fought and a signal victory won by the troops under his command over the enemy. The number of troops engaged was comparatively small, but I consider this victory one of the most  signal which has been gained during the war. Accounts through the newspapers were received on yesterday, containing the Mexican account of a victory obtained by Col. Doniphan, commanding the Missouri Volunteers, over the enemy, and that he had taken the city of Chihuahua.  7 The truth is our troops, regulars and volunteers, will obtain victories wherever they meet the enemy. This they would do if they were without officers to command them higher in rank than lieutenants. It is injustice, therefore, to award to the generals all the credit.
