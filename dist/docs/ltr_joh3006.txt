SIR, 
</p><p>
The Congress have received your letter of the 19th 
instant, and highly commend your prudence and zeal 
in applying to the Governments of New Hampshire, 
Massachusetts Bay, and Connecticut, to raise forces 
for the service of Canada at this exigency. They 
have fond hopes, by the zeal and alacrity of those 
Colonies, troops will be forwarded with such expedition as will not only succour our friends, but in some 
measure retrieve our loss, and put us in possession of Quebec, before our enemies can receive reinforcements. 
</p><p>
The Congress have agreed to add the Massachusetts regiment to the forces they at first destined for Canada. This is the more necessary, as it is now uncertain whether two battalions, as was expected, can be 
raised out of the troops in that country. But they do not, by this, mean to weaken your army. They have, therefore, ordered that the three regiments you 
applied for from Massachusetts Bay, New Hampshire, and Connecticut, shall be exclusive of the thirteen wanted for the army at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>. 
</p><p>
By the latest advices from England, it appears that 
Administration are determined to exert themselves, and 
to send a considerable force against us next spring, 
though at the same time they pretend to say, that 
they will offer terms of accommodation, and mean 
only by their armament to enforce their terms. 
</p><p>
It behooves us, therefore, to be ready to receive 
them; for, should an accommodation take place, the 
terms will be severe or favorable in proportion to 
our ability to resist, 
</p><p>
The Congress highly approve your sending General Lee to the assistance of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as a measure 
judicious and necessary, and have also appointed 
three of their body to repair to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and confer with General Lee and the Committee of Safety 
of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, on the subject of putting that Colony 
in a posture of defence. 
</p><p>
General Prescott arrived here last Thursday, and is 
this day ordered into close confinement in the jail 
of this city. 
</p><p>
I must beg leave to refer you to the inclosed resolutions. I send, by this express, commissions for the 
Massachusetts battalion, and the money ordered to 
the Assembly. I have the honor to be, with the 
greatest esteem, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
