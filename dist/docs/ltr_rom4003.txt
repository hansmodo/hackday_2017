Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I hear your health is mended since the date of your last 
letter of the 20th July, and rejoice at it. Your distant 
friends suffer irreparable injury if you are indisposed to 
write; those who write so well should write often, and 
even your short letters say so much in so few words, that 
it is impossible not to wish for them, if longer ones cannot 
be had. I acknowledge the force of all your observations 
on my intended resignation, and know the necessity of perseverance so long as there is a prospect of being useful ; 
but you must also acknowledge that it is folly in the extreme to continue in the drudgery of office after you see 
clearly that the public cannot be benefited ; your own 
affairs suffering, your feelings daily wounded, and your 
reputation endangered by the malice and misrepresentation 
of envious and designing men. During the war, I was 
determined to go through with the work I had undertaken, 
and although my resignation was made before the signing 
of the provisional treaty was known, yet I made no hesitation to declare to a committee of Congress, that if the war 
lasted I would continue. The war, however, ceased â€” 
Congress feared to dismiss their army without some pay ; 
they had not money, and could only make payment by 
paper anticipation, and even this could not be effected 
without my assistance. I was urged to continue, and 
forced into that anticipation. The army was dispersed, 
and since their departure, the men who urged these measures most, and who are eternally at war with honour and 
integrity, have been continually employed in devising 
measures to prevent my being able to fulfil my engagements, in hopes of effecting my ruin in case of failure. I 
must, however, in justice to the majority of Congress, 
which has ever been composed of honest men, declare that 
the faction I allude to is but inconsiderable in numbers, 
although they make themselves of some consequence by 
this assiduity. You know the ****, &c. : I should disregard these men totally, if I found a disposition in the 
several Legislatures to support national faith, credit, and 
character ; but, unhappily, there is at present a total inattendon on their parts. I am, however, persuaded, that 
sooner or later, the good sense of America will prevail, and 
that our governments will be intrusted in the hands of men 
whose principles will lead them to do justice, and whose 
understandings w T ill teach the value of national credit. 
This may be too long in coming to pass, at least for me, 
and therefore you may rest assured, that I quit all public 
employ the moment my engagements are fulfilled.

The court of France having refused the last sum asked, 
I do not wish to trouble them further. I am not sensible 
of having at any time made an improper application, either 
as to substance or manner. Those who are solicited in 
such cases, are in the situation to make whatever objections 
they find convenient. I wish, however, that the ministers 
in France were sensible of one truth, which is, that my administration either saved them a good deal of money, or a 
great deal of disgrace ; for if I had not undertaken it when 
I did, they must either have advanced ten times the amount 
I received, or have deserted America, after having undertaken her cause, and perhaps have been obliged to subscribe 
to very indifferent terms of peace for themselves.

It is happy for me that the loan in Holland stepped in to 
our relief, after the refusal of the court to grant the moderate sum of 3,000,000 livres as the concluding point. This 
refusal was ill-timed and impolitic. I could show resentment with some effect, if I were so disposed ; but so far 
from it, I retain a grateful remembrance of past favours, 
and make a point to promote the commercial intercourse 
between France and this country. I must also show my 
sense of the obligations conferred on us by the Hollanders. 
We hear that the definitive treaty is signed. I long to see 
it ; for you may depend that unless some new articles are 
added respecting our intercourse with the British West 
Indies, it will be both a work of difficulty and time to carry 
measures that will justify your opinion of us. I thank you 
for the kind sentiments which you express of me in several 
parts of your letters. I will endeavour to deserve them. 
I do not know whether <a href='/results.php?tla=gom' rel='friend met colleague'>Gouverneur</a> writes to you by this 
opportunity ; you must cherish his friendship, it is worth 
possessing, lie has more virtue than he shows, and more 
consistency than anybody believes. He values you exceedingly, and hereafter you will be very useful to each other. 
Mrs. Morris will write to Mrs. Jay, and say for herself 
what she has to say ; though I don't believe she will tell 
her, as she docs to everybody else, the high estimation in 
which she holds Mrs. Jay and yourself. Permit me also, 
my worthy friend, to assure you both of the sincerity of 
that affection with which I profess myself 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=rom" rel="me">Robert Morris<a/>.
