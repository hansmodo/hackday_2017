DEAR SON : 
</p><p>
This is the first chance I have had to write you. I am, by the care 
of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, in the field in defence of my country. When I reflect 
on the matter, I feel myself distracted on both hands by this thought, that in my old age I should be obliged to take the field in defence of 
my rights and liberties, and that of my children. God only knows 
that it is not of choice, but of necessity, and from the consideration 
that I had rather suffer anything than lose my birthright, and that of 
my children, When I come to lay down in the field, stripped of all 
the pleasure that my family connections afford me at home- surrounded 
by an affectionate wife and eight dear children, and all the blessings of 
life when I reflect on my own distress, I feel for that of my family, 
on account of my absence from their midst; and especially for the 
mother, who sits like a dove that has lost its mate, having the weight 
of the family on her shoulders. These thoughts make me afraid that 
the son we so carefully nursed in our youth may do something that would 
grieve his mother. Now, my son, if my favor is worth seeking, let me 
tell you the only step to procure it is the care of your tender mother 
to please her is ten times more valuable than any other favor that you 
could do me in my person. I hope that when you come to reflect on 
the duty of a son to a tender parent, you will take every step to establish that connection, which will add to my happiness; for it is a pleasure 
to me to know that I have a son who is able to manage my business 
and plantation affairs. Make it your study to be obliging to your 
mother, being careful not to do anything that may grieve her. Take 
the utmost care of every thing that falls under your care, so that you 
may receive, on my return, my thanks, and have the blessing of being 
a faithful and dutiful son to his trust. I would have you to consider 
yourself filling one of the most important posts that could be confided 
in you; and if you should manage well, it will greatly redound to your 
praise. After these serious thoughts, I beg that you will take these 
hints. In the first place, consider that the eye of God is on you, and 
to secure His blessing is the only way to make yourself, and those that 
are concerned with you, happy; for to fear God is the first and great command. 
</p><p>
The next command is, to honor thy. father and mother. Now, the 
only way to do this, is not to do anything that will grieve or oppress 
them. Be kind to your brothers and sisters, and careful to manage the 
business to the interest of the family. Your care and good conduct in 
the management of my plantation adds greatly to my happiness; and I 
can promise you, that you shall feel the good effects of it, for I have 
the pleasure to hear by your tender mother's letter to me, that you. are 
doing very well, and business goes on well. I am happy to hear it. 
I have wrote several times about trying to get a few good horses. 1 
expect by this time you have made the trial ; if you have been successful in procuring some, I shall be glad to hear how many, and what sort 
they are, and I will send some good man to bring them down -if unsuccessful in your effort, no matter. I want Nancy brought to me at that 
time to ride. Try to have the mares in as good order as possible ; be 
careful that they are all well fed; let them be used as little as possible. 
I have traded for a fine English mare, which is on Fishing Creek, at 
Mr. Win. Adair s; the order is enclosed for her. I wish you could 
get a man to go for her, or spare the time to go yourself, as she is a 
valuable animal. If you go, Mr. Adair will, doubtless, be saying some 
thing about her. She was taken from MeGirth by Capt. Moore, and I 
bought his right of her; she is a young, full-blood mare, and has no 
brand on her unless Adair has branded her since she has been to his 
house. He took her up in favor of Capt. Moore, and since she was 
carried from camp I traded for her. I want her got home with as little 
stir as possible, and branded on both cushions with my branding iron; 
and let it be said that I bought her of a man on Fishing Creek, and paid 
$1,000. My reason for begging you to go for her is, that it may not 
be known she is a plunder mare; and when we have the pleasure of 
meeting, I will put you in possession of all the particulars regarding 
her. I shall be glad if you put her to the horse as soon as you get her. 
On all necessary occasions get Mr. Griffin to help you about the plantation. Regarding the horses I wrote you about, you may either come 
or let it alone, just as you please, as I can send for them if you have 
any agreeable to my direction. 
</p><p>
I am sorry I have to inform you of the melancholy death of Anthony 
Griffin, which took place on the 11th instant, while out with a scouting 
party. Alighting from his horse, and leaning on his gun, it accidentally went off, shooting him through the head. He never spoke after 
the accident. This is the fatal consequence of handling guns without proper care ; they ought to be used with the greatest caution. The 
uncertainty of life ought to induce every man to prepare for death. 
</p><p>
As for news, I have nothing more to communicate than what I wrote 
last to your dear mother. I hope every thing will be done to have the 
mill in as good order as possible, to grind up the wheat; and as soon 
as you can, supply the saw mill with timber, as I desire it put in operation. In regard to whiskey, I think you must raise the price of it, in 
order to have things as much on an average as possible. I think you 
ought to sell it at two dollars a quart; if by retail, one dollar a half 
pint. Secure all you can at 35 per 110 gallons. I am in hopes of 
being at home by the 1st July, to see my family. I shall be glad to 
hear from you by every opportunity. Son, I think if you manage matters well, and I am spared, I can put affairs in such a state that, under 
the blessing of God, we may stand in as good a position as any family 
in the State. Pray, let no pains be spared to make every edge cut, 
and have the crops secured in the best manner, as much depend on 
them. 
</p><p>
Now, my son, I must bid you farewell. I commit you to the care of Providence, begging that you will try to obtain that peculiar blessing. 
May God bless you, my son, and give you grace to conduct yourself, in my absence, as becomes a dutiful son to a tender mother and the family. 
I am in reasonable good health at present, and the regiment as much so as could be expected. The death of Griffin is much lamented. I 
hope in God this will find you, my son, and your dear mother and the children, all well. My best compliments to you all, and all enquiring friends. 
</p><p>
I am, dear son, with great respect, your affectionate father,
