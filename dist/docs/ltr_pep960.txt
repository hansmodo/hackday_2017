My Dear Friend:--This is Sunday. The boys are sitting around the windows of the office, keeping up a continual rattling, while the wind is raging without. The Lord only knows when I will bid farewell to the black walls of the Record office. Perhaps only when I "shuffle off this mortal coil." Things are as dull as ever. A number of marriages have taken place, but the Gideons still preserve their original purity. The ladies are not very well attended to. I have quit altogether. I do not want to marry any girl, and I do not think it is treating a girl properly to go only with her, so long, without some object. It might be depriving her of other opportunities. But enough of this.

I had almost forgotten to say that on Thursday last I received a package of letters from you, mailed at Valparaiso, the contents of which sent joy to my heart. These letters were the first positive intelligence we have had from you since you left the Breakwater. They dispelled our doubt and conveyed to us and all your friends the happy news that you were then living and well. The general letter is in type for the Record the coming week. Mr. Evans bid me ask you to write at every opportunity. He was so much pleased that he
paid the postage on your letters and said he would do the same on all future ones.

And now to that portion of the private letter to myself. I mean that part where you ask of me as an old and true friend to state whether <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=eap" rel="friend met">Miss Apple</a> remains devoted to you. It affords me great pleasure to be able to say that every indication and action of hers up to this time express the purest devotion to you and your welfare. That she has been true and will remain true to the end, I have not the least doubt. In fact, I am sometimes afraid that her intense anxiety for your safety and speedy return will prey upon her health, as it has already upon her spirits. I often call to see her, and encourage her, telling her to hope for the best and urging her to look at the bright side of the picture. I offer her every favor in my power, and sometimes accompany her to lectures and concerts to enliven her spirits. The letters from you she reads and rereads.

The intelligence we have from California is very contradictory. We scarcely know what story to believe. From some of our California boys we have melancholy news--from others just the reverse.
</p><p>
Mr. Evans and all hands ask to be remembered. I remain,
</p><p>
your devoted friend,
