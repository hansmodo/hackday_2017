Dear Brother : . . . The gun boats were handled beautifully, and without them we should have had hard work, 
with them it was easy. Our entire loss will be less than 
1000. We took 5000 prisoners, killed and wounded 
some 500, took 16 guns, ammunition, corn and wagons, 
mules and all sorts of traps of which you will hear 
enough. My official report is in, will go up to Grant at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a> to-morrow and right on to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. Halleek will let you see it, and you can understand the whole 
thing by a glance at the maps I send along. But McClernand's reports will precede it and of course will be 
the accepted history. . . . 
</p><p>
On the supposition that Banks will have taken Fort 
Hudson and reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>, we start back for that 
place to-morrow. Of ourselves we cannot take <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>. With Banks and a fleet below us and a fleet 
above, we may make a desperate attempt, but <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> 
is as strong as Gibraltar, and is of vital importance to 
the cause of the South. Of course they will fight desperately for it. We must do the same, for all are conscious that the real danger of the war, anarchy among 
our people, begins to dawn. The people of the North 
mistake widely if they suppose they can have peace now 
by opposing this war. . . . 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="colleague met">Mr. Lincoln</a> intended to insult me and the military 
profession by putting McClernand over me, and I would 
have quietly folded up my things and gone to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a>, 
only I know in times like these all must submit to insult 
and infamy if necessary. The very moment I think 
some other is at hand to take my corps I'll slide out. . . . 
I hope the politicians will not interfere with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a>. 
You have driven off <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gbm" rel="colleague met">McClellan</a>, and is <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aeb" rel="colleague met">Burnside</a> any 
better? Buell is displaced. Is Rosecrans any faster? 
His victory at Murfreesboro is dearly bought. Let <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a> alone, and if things don't go to your liking don't 
charge it to men but to the condition of things. Human 
power is limited, and you cannot appreciate the difficulty 
of moulding into an homogeneous machine the discordant 
elements which go to make up our armies. A thousand 
dollars a day would not pay me for the trouble of managing a volunteer army. I never dreamed of so severe 
a test of my patriotism as being superseded by McClernand, and if I can keep down my tamed (?) spirit and 
live I will claim a virtue higher than Brutus. I rarely 
see a newspaper and am far behind the times, indeed, 
am not conscious that a Congress sits, though I know it 
must. Do think of the army and try and give us the 
means to maintain discipline, prevent desertion, pillage 
and absenteeism. Under the present system of mere 
threats and no punishment, our armies melt away like 
snow before the sun. I doubt if <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aeb" rel="colleague met">Burnside</a>, Rosecrans, 
Grant and Curtis now have, all combined, 300,000 in 
their front ranks. This army, 30,000 a month ago, 
though reinforced by 2400 men, is now down to 24,000, 
though we have lost only 2500 in battle sickness and 
detachments make a perfect stream to the rear. Blair 
has a brigade in my corps and sees now the practices of 
war as contrasted with its theory, and could give some 
useful hints on these points.
