I have been wishing, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse sweetheart met">Mary</a>, to write to you for more than a week,
but every day and every hour seem so taken up that I have found it
impossible....  The news from Tennessee and North Carolina is not all
cheering, and disasters seem to be thickening around us.  It calls
for renewed energies and redoubled strength on our part, and, I hope,
will produce it.  I fear our soldiers have not realised the necessity
for the endurance and labour they are called upon to undergo, and that
it is better to sacrifice themselves than our cause.  God, I hope,
will shield us and give us success.  Here the enemy is progressing
slowly in his designs, and does not seem prepared, or to have determined
when or where to make his attack.  His gunboats are pushing up all the
creeks and marshes of the Savannah, and have attained a position so
near the river as to shell the steamers navigating it.  None have as
yet been struck.  I am engaged in constructing a line of defense at
Fort Jackson which, if time permits and guns can be obtained, I hope
will keep them out.  They can bring such overwhelming force in all
their movements that it has the effect to demoralise our new troops.
The accounts given in the papers of the quantity of cotton shipped to
New York are, of course, exaggerated.  It is cotton in the seed and
dirt, and has to be ginned and cleaned after its arrival.  It is
said that the negroes are employed in picking and collecting it, and
are paid a certain amount.  But all these things are gathered from
rumour, and can only be believed as they appear probable, which this
seems to be....  I went yesterday to church, being the day appointed
for fasting and prayer.  I wish I could have passed it more devoutly.
The bishop (Elliott) gave a most beautiful prayer for the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jed" rel="colleague met">President</a>,
which I hope may be heard and answered....  Here the yellow jasmine,
red-bud, orange-tree, etc., perfume the whole woods, and the japonicas
and azaleas cover the garden.  Perry and Meredith are well.  May God
bless and keep you always is the constant prayer of your husband,
