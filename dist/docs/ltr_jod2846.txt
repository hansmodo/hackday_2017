I GIVE you joy of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> and Charlestown, once more the habitation of Americans. I am waiting with great 
impatience for letters from you, which I know, will contain many particulars. We are taking precautions 
to defend every place that is in danger, the Carolinas, Virginia, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, Canada. I can think of 
nothing but fortifying <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> harbor. I want more cannon than are to be had. I want a fortification upon Point Alderton, one upon Lovell's Island, one 
upon George's Island, several upon Long Island, one upon the Moon, one upon Squantum. I want to 
hear of half a dozen fire ships, and two or three hundred fire rafts prepared. I want to hear of row-galleys, 
floating batteries built, and booms laid across the channel in the narrows, and Vaisseaux de Prise 
sunk in it I wish to hear that you are translating <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a> commons into the channel. No efforts, no 
expense are too extravagant for me to wish for, to fortify that harbor so as to make it impregnable. I hope every body will join and work until it is done.

We have this week lost a very valuable friend of the colonies in Governor Ward, of Rhode Island, by 
the small pox in the natural way. He never would hearken to his friends, who have been constantly advising him to be inoculated, ever since the first Congress began. But he would not be persuaded. Numbers, who have been inoculated, have gone through 
this distemper without any danger, or even confinement, but nothing would do. He must take it in the 
natural way, and die. He was an amiable and a sensible man, a steadfast friend to his country upon very 
pure principles. His funeral was attended with the same solemnities as Mr. Randolph's. Mr. Stillman 
being the Anabaptist minister here, of which persuasion was the Governor, was desired by Congress to 
preach a sermon, which he did with great applause.

Remember me as you ought.
