My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your acceptable & interesting letter of the 6 th ins 1 was this moment 
rec d & I regret to hear the weather has been so wet & stormy at Point 
Isabel, which had the effect of making the sick & wounded much more 
uncomfortable, already enough so, than would have been had the weather 
been more favorable ; but I hope the rainy season has pretty much 
passed away, & if the buildings for the Hospital at Fort Polk can be 
once roofed, it is to be hoped they will get on much better than has here 
tofore been the case ; it will only be necessary to protect them from the 
effects of driving rains for several months. A medical officer should be 
stationed at Brasos Island, & besides attending to the sick of Cap Porter s Com d & others entitled to medical aid, might act as health officer so 
far as to prohibit any contageous disease from spreading among the 
troops & laborers there. I consider it is passed the time for the arrival 
of Texan volunteers, & the sooner Captain Wood & his Com d return 
the better. There are yet several Regt s of Volunteers twelve months 
men to arrive at Brasos, two from Illinois & one from Missouri, if they 
should not be sent to some other, which I hope will be the case, as we 
have already as many troops of that description as we can get transpor 
tation for, & perhaps more. I flatter myself all the Louisiana six or 
three months volunteers have gotten off, & the twelve months men have 
been all removed from Brasos to the Rio Grande, if so it will be a great 
relief to the Q r M. dept. who will in that case be able to give more 
attention to having the necessary supplies sent here to enable us to move 
against <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>, which are very much behind hand. 
</p><p>
On the subject of Grahams letter of the Louisiana Volunteers, it is 
matter of no moment let the motive or intention be what it may ; if 
intended to injure me in any way, I can only view it as a squib or cracker, 
which makes a momentary noise, but passes away afterwards without 
inflicting injury on any one, unless on he who fires it, & is immediately 
forgotten as if it had never occurred 
</p><p>
I again must say I am satisfied England & perhaps France particu 
larly the first, will offer her mediation very soon if she has not already 
done so, to bring about a settlement of the difficulties now existing 
between this country & Mexico, but whether such will be acceded to by 
either party time must determine ; I apprehend our demands as regards 
acquisition of territory will be pretty exorbitant, at least I fear so, which 
may prevent an early settlement of the quarrel ; but I hope for the 
best As regards the Medical Corps I must repeat what I have already 
said, that it is best to bear without complaining many things as regards 
management, or mismanagement which we cannot remedy Hawkins 
requires since the removal of Roberst 1 some ass c Surg n to aid him at 
S l Josephs, saying he has over 90 sick at that place ; if so, none can 
have rec d

Craig is certainly pretty well broken down, & not at all calculated to 
be at the head of the dep r in the field, alth possessing many good points 
particularly as regards bearing truth honor & honesty ; few of which are 
known to, or are appreciated by Foot, but we must take people as they 
are, & not as we would make them Col Taylor will visit Fort Polk 
or Brasos before he comes up, & I hope will be able to take the field 
with us but I think it very doubtful if his health will permit I shall 
feel quite uneasy as regards Anns movements until I hear whether she 
will continue in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Detroit" rel="city">Detroit</a> or will go to Cincinnati or New Port, & if to 
either of the latter until she is comfortably located ; I agree with you 
that it would be most advisable for her to board for a time at least, or at 
any rate until you can join her with the prospect of remain for a time at 
least at some desirable station. Good boarding at some highly respectable establishment on moderate or fair terms particularly in Cincinnati 
where the children could be put to proper litirary establishments

I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoros" rel="city">Matamoros</a> on the eving of the 4th ins t & arrived here on the 
night of the 7th  by steam boat, without accident other than breaking our 
rudder which took a day & a half to repair. I found the troops in toler 
able health who had preced me, who where encamped along the bank of 
the river San Juan near the town of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a> which had been nearly 
destroyed by a most extraordinary freshet which occurred the latter of 
June ; here we are collecting & have succeeded in getting in depot a 
large supply of provisions but there is a great deficiency of forage tools 
& many other articles belonging to Q r M. dep r as well as a great deficiency in the ordnance dep both of which I hope will be remedied in a 
very short time by sending forward ample supplies of both as there is 
now no want of transportation on the Rio Grande at this time ; some of 
the most common material I absolutely want was in the Q r M. dep 
which I have been urging the officers to have put in depo for the last two 
months without success such as horse shoes & horse shoe nails, which are 
absolutely necessary to enable us to move As soon as they, with the 
ordnance & ordnance expected here with Majr Craig get up I shall at 
once prepare to take the field, & hope to have about 6000 men by the 
first of Sepf for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> if not disappointed by the officers of the two 
dept s refferred to, but have great apprehensions as regards the energies & 
arrangements as regards the officers attached to both in those respects 
L McNest of the ordnance dep reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoros" rel="city">Matamoros</a> a day or two before 
I left there but did not come by the way of Fort Polk, as I am disposed 
to believe he was rather affraid he would be detained ; I directed him to 
go to the Point & report to Majr Craig who was there, which he did not 
seem very much to relish ; & I presume he will very much dislike to 
relieve Ramsey, which I presume he will be directed to do The troops 
are concentrating here pretty fast, I expect the whole of the regulars with 
the exception of Websters & Taylors Comp s will be here by the 2O th & 
they as soon after as the horses for their batteries arrive to enable them 
commence their march for this, which I hope is the case by this time if 
not before I presume there will be at least by the last of the month 
three or four thousand of the twelve months volunteers here Col 
Johnstons 1 Texas Volunteers, a part of which got here day before yester 
day, I apprehend will most of them disband themselves in a few days, 
very much to his mortification ; & it is possible the mounted men from 
the same state will do so likewise ; this will not prevent me from march 
ing on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> as soon as the Q r M. & Ordnance dept s can give me 
the means to enable me to do so with the slightest prospect of success. 
The country expects this army to attempt something & there shall be no 
disappointment so far as I am concerned There has been much rain 
here for some time past, but the weather is now fine with the exception 
of being very hot & has been for several days, & the roads pretty good, 
so much so was all ready we could take up the line of march for the 
interior tomorrow We have no news of interest from any quarter ; 
the boat is wating to go below & I do not wish to detain her ; I write in 
great haste, & hardly know what I have written & doubt your being able 
to make it out but you must take it for what it is worth
