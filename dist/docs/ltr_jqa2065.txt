TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
</p><p>
No. 28 [EDMUND RANDOLPH] 
</p><p>
THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, March lyth, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Our foreign communications except with France are still 
interrupted, so that I have neither the means of receiving or 
of conveying foreign intelligence. The Danish Minister 
here sends a courier who will pass through Hamburg, and by 
his kindness I have an opportunity to send my letters there, 
uncertain when they will go from thence. 
</p><p>
As to this country a profound tranquility is the principal 
circumstance that characterises its present internal state. 
The States General still retain their forms and their name, for 
the purpose of preserving without intermission the chain of 
their connection with foreign nations ; but the members who 
compose that assembly have undergone a total change. 
</p><p>
Six of the provinces are now represented under the new 
arrangements, and the representation from Zeeland may be expected daily to complete the confederacy, the former 
deputation having some time since been recalled. 
</p><p>
This Assembly and the several Provincial Assemblies of 
the Republic are still employed in abolishing the institutions 
of the former Constitution and substituting other arrangements in their stead. The President of the Assembly of 
Holland, in a speech after the completion of his third presidence, mentions the general system upon which the Revolution is conducted. The exterior forms (he says) of the 
Legislative part of the Constitution are used to operate a complete change in the Executive part which, when new organized, will supply the means of effecting the same alteration in the Legislative. 
</p><p>
The administration of the military force by sea and by 
land under the former Constitution was cumbrous, like all 
the rest of that system. It has now been simplified and put 
under the direction of single committees. Mr. Paulus is 
president of the Marine Committee, and as his talents for 
this administration have heretofore been found essentially 
serviceable to one of the Boards of Admiralty, it is expected 
that his talents will be of infinite service, as the sphere of their 
employment will now be co-extensive with the Republic. 
</p><p>
The situation of this country's naval power has already 
been stated to you. The list of ships published by authority 
under the old government named forty-three men of war 
and thirty-five frigates as the number of the existing navy ; 
of these not more than fifteen of each were in commission, 
and of those in commission not more than a third part are 
now fit for being sent into action. The foundation for a 
respectable force however exists, and the importance of 
this department for securing permanency to the revolution 
is well known to those now having the direction of affairs, 
as appears very clearly by their placing the most prominent 
character of the Revolution at the head of it. 
</p><p>
There is reason to suppose that the exertions which will 
unquestionably be directed to this question will be productive 
of effect more than appears to be expected. The system of 
neglecting the maritime force and suffering it to perish by 
degrees was essentially connected with, and the natural 
effect of, a subordinate intimacy with the self-entitled rulers 
of the waves. To court their friendship, to deprecate their 
resentment, or to secure their protection, nothing could be 
more effectual than to lay aside the means of being formidable to them ; and, accordingly for the space of the last 
forty years, in peace and in war, whether leagued as allies, 
opposed as enemies, or indifferent as neutrals, the deadly 
torpor of a political opiate has incessantly been infusing 
into every vein and artery of this naval constitution, while 
the siren song of family affections has always been added to 
charm its sensations as they weakened, and gently soothe 
into the slumber of death. 
</p><p>
But now an opposite system will undoubtedly direct the 
policy of this Republic, and the principal exertions of the 
nation will be applied to their maritime affairs. But nothing 
can be done without money, and the public treasuries are 
empty. A loan of eight millions is ordered to be furnished 
by the city of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> within the space of a month, at an 
interest of three and a half per cent, and will undoubtedly 
be furnished. Similar and proportionable contributions 
will, perhaps, be levied upon the other cities of the province. 
The burden may possibly be thought severe, but it will not 
be intolerable. 
</p><p>
In the meantime the fate of the country still remains 
undecided. The French armies are still here as conquerors, 
and the substance of independence is not so scrupulously 
observed as its forms. The property of the Stadtholder 
was considered for some time as being comprehended under the protection promised by the proclamation of the 
French Representatives, but it is now declared to have 
become the spoil of the conquerors. This arrangement 
however carries with it nothing very disagreeable to the present administration here. They are not much disposed to 
regard the losses of a family which they so cordially detest, 
and perhaps they think themselves well rid of an administration to property encumbered with debts beyond its value. This will prove no inconvenience to the French, who take 
the estate but leave the debts to be paid by the former owner. 
</p><p>
By the forms of the present system, whatever the French government choose to have done is notified by the French 
Representatives here to the Assembly of the States General. They take their resolutions accordingly, and the execution 
is by the common authority of the country. For military affairs the generals possess the supremacy of notifying. 
</p><p>
In the substance the people are subjected to the usual consequences of conquest. More than a hundred thousand 
soldiers are quartered among the people. It is a grievous affliction, but is borne with as much composure as may be 
expected. An heavy requisition of clothing and provisions has been levied. It was painful, but the articles were 
supplied. The greatest difficulty has been respecting the introduction and circulation of assignats. It was a favorite 
object here to obtain exemption from the necessity of making them forcibly current ; people of all descriptions dreaded 
them, and it was for some time hoped that there would be 
an arrangement on the subject to give general satisfaction. 
</p><p>
But the troops must be constantly supplied with sundry articles, and they had nothing but paper to pay for their 
purchases. At length a law was enacted by the provisional assembly of Holland which directed the acceptance of the 
paper in payment for necessary articles furnished to the troops. The intention was to circumscribe the compulsive 
circulation within those limits, and the law declared that the holders of the paper under this regulation might deliver it 
over to the municipalities of the towns. The assignats are valued at nine stuivers to the livre, which is very nearly 
equivalent to the nominal value. But the latter part of the law is not hitherto executed, and the holders, of course, 
are not perfectly satisfied. 
</p><p>
I am this day informed that the new deputies from Zeeland 
have taken their seats in the States General so that the 
representation under the new arrangement is complete 
from all the provinces. . . .
