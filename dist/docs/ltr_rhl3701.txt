Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of replying to your polite and 
agreeable letter of July the 15th, by my son Ludwell, whom I expected either to wait on you with it 
in Virginia, or to get the letter forwarded by the 
<a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>. Although I am at this time 
laboring under a severe fit of the gout, it is impossible to refrain from congratulating you, and rejoicing 
with our country on the present happy and glorious 
prospect before us. The very judicious and decisive 
step that you have taken in coming here, seems to 
put it out of the power of fortune to prevent the 
enemy in this State from falling into your hands. 
At least my mind can reach hut to two preventives â€” 
the coming of naval aid from Europe, which is hardly 
possible ; and the want of provisions for our good 
allies and ourselves, which cannot be probable. A 
proper watch will surely be kept upon marine motions in Europe, to prevent the repetition of such 
scenes as the relieving of Gibraltar. And it is inadmissible that, in this land of abundance, so disgraceful 
a thing should happen as the dispersion of a force 
collected for our salvation, for want of provisions, 
which now the country abounds with. 
</p><p>
I assure you. Sir, the Commissaries' and Quartermasters' departments in the State, so far as I have 
observed them, have in every thing been the reverse 
of right, insomuch that I have been well informed 
the fcw troops with the Marquis have frequently felt 
distress for want of provisions. At present the land 
and sea force, which may come to lean on these 
broken staffs, will probably reach to forty-five or 
fifty thousand men. We have now a good character 
at the head of our State and War Offices, and I make 
no doubt but that he will exert all his powers with 
diligence. To prevent, however, the greatest of all 
misfortunes, want of success from want of provisions, 
can we not add some methods not destructive of the 
present plans, and which may aid their efficiency? 
Suppose immediate notice were given to the possessors of good merchant mills, that they should be paid 
with specie for the flour they brought to your army and the navy, and a better price for it the sooner 
it reached. And wherever a competent person would 
undertake in a reasonable time to deliver a proper 
quantity, let his mill and wagons have protection 
from the destructive talons of impressors. Upon these 
last, let me here make one observation for all. Their 
grip generally squeezes the best citizens, and leaves 
the rest, and is always executed for the greater ease 
and profit of the impressor, so that now the people 
in general are exerting their wits to elude and hide 
their property from these characters. To prevent this 
plan from being executed with partiality, and upon 
views of job, some men having knowledge of the 
country, of honor, integrity, and diligence, should be 
employed to ride through the upper counties and see 
as much flour despatched as possible. With regard 
to the hard money, I suppose that our allies will furnish a sufficiency for their own supply, which will 
leave no great matter for us ; and this, if we are 
rightly informed here, our Congress Financier might 
furnish, since the return of <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a> from 
France. 
</p><p>
The present mode of getting beef from the several 
circles would answer, if diligently executed. But to 
aid this, for health, as well as plenty, suppose that an 
active Justice of the Peace, first Militia Officer, and 
one of the Delegates in each county, or any two of 
the three, were immediately, by government, empowered and exhorted to proceed with diligence and take 
one half of the bacon and salt beef in possession of 
every family, and despatch it in pressed wagons, 
carts, or vessels, immediately to the army. The season now is, when persons in the country may find 
many resources beside salted meat to subsist upon. 
In short, victory must not be prevented by want of victuals, and these must be obtained at any rate. 
Although I have seen the baneful influence of these 
impresses, yet, upon this great and apparently final 
occasion, it seems admissible to extend a little under 
proper direction, not to destroy the present system. 
I mean in this exigence to aid, not to annihilate now, 
the old imperfect plan. I should suppose that if specie pay were promised, the fleet might be well furnished with vegetables from the water-bound counties. 
I assure your Excellency that I should not have 
troubled you, or roused from my present state to 
make these observations, if it were not because of my 
great anxiety lest we should fail of the happy end 
before us for want of provisions ; and upon this principle I am sure of your pardon. But now that I am 
thus engaged, permit me to make a few observations 
upon the negroes now with the enemy, in case of 
the surrender of the latter. I have been told that it 
is fixed, but whether by civil or military power, I 
know not, that the owners, or any other person, may 
have the slaves on paying five pound specie into the 
public treasury for each. It would seem that the unfortunate owners should be relieved on terms as easy 
as possible. The Admiralty has some regulations 
upon subjects taken within their Province ; but how 
they apply to this case, I see not. And I believe 
that the singular manner in which Great Britain has 
conducted this war against America, leaves no clue 
to direct us in former practice. Force, fraud, intrigue, 
theft, have all in turn been employed to delude these 
unhappy people, and to defraud their masters ! My 
brother William has lost sixty-five, among whom are 
about forty-five valuable grown slaves and useful artisans. I would say nothing in his favor from his 
many other losses, or the personal injuries that have befallen tim. from his attachment to his native country. General systems will be applied to general subjects, and I shall be content with those that you establish. I would only observe, that he is now upon 
the Continent of Europe, where he has been detained 
by the disagreeable consequences that might follow 
the committing his wife and children to the sea in 
these precarious times, and the necessity of his presence with them in a foreign land, where he is sufficiently distressed for their support ; the profits of his 
estate here having all been put into the town offices, 
and his numerous debts in England not recoverable 
at present. He has now no day in their Court, and 
no lawyer has been found that would bring suits 
for him. Perhaps it will be thought equitable, if any 
salvage is demanded, to allow absentees a reasonable 
indulgence for payment. I have the honor to be, 
with the most perfect esteem. Sir, your Excellency's 
Most affectionate and obedient servant,
