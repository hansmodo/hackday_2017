<p>
TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
</p><p>
No. [EDMUND RANDOLPH] 
</p><p>
THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, November 7, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1794">1794</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR: 
</p><p>
By a letter, which I received since I wrote you last, I 
am informed that the bankers of the United States have 
done nothing as Commissioners for the loan of 800,000 dollars, not having received from Colonel Humphreys the notice 
which they were instructed to wait for previous to their act 
ing under this commission. They add, that under the present 
circumstances the loan would be altogether impracticable, 
and they cannot foresee when it will again be feasible. Of 
all this they have no doubt given information to you, and 
to the Secretary of the Treasury. 
</p><p>
In my letter of the 2nd instant I have mentioned the 
mutual dissatisfaction which has for some time prevailed 
among the allied powers, and I have before noticed the re 
ports of a separate peace made by the King of Prussia. 
This fact seems at present to be put beyond a doubt, as the 
name of the minister who signed the Treaty on the part of 
Prussia appears in the papers of this day. 
</p><p>
Spain has also sent a minister to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> to negotiate a 
peace, and two ministers on the part of the Empire are 
employed for the same purpose, one in Switzerland, and the 
other is said to be now at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>. It seems to be an opinion 
prevalent here, as well as in England, which I mentioned 
in my first letter from thence, that the French Republic 
will be disposed to grant moderate terms to all the allies 
except Great Britain, and as the system of moderation ap 
pears to be obtaining increasing ascendancy in the National 
Convention and throughout the Republic, the probability 
that England and France will be alone engaged at the open 
ing of the ensuing campaign daily strengthens. 
</p><p>
As to this country, it is well known to you, Sir, how close 
a political connection has been maintained between its 
government and that of Great Britain since the Revolution 
here in the year <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1787">1787</a>. But a connection still closer has 
subsisted with Prussia, which is cemented by the ties of 
blood between the consorts of the Stadtholdcr and of the 
hereditary Prince of Orange, and the King of Prussia, the 
former being his sister and the latter his daughter. Hitherto 
the British and Prussian influence here has been exerted in 
perfect union, but after this peace made by Prussia I think 
it it impossible they should long continue to harmonize. 
</p><p>
The Court of St. James will no doubt be very much dissatisfied with that of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=berlin" rel="city">Berlin</a>, for making this peace, and a 
coolness between them must I think ensue. The Prussian 
influence here must be favorable to peace between this 
Republic and France, to which Great Britain cannot certainly consent. 
</p><p>
But in the present situation of things in this country, 
peace has become an object of urgent necessity to the govern 
ing power here. They imagine and perhaps not without foundation, that their existence depends upon their obtaining it. And for the very same reason the Patriots do not 
appear desirous for peace at all. They had rather submit 
to an external enemy than bear a yoke, in their minds more 
intolerable, of what they call internal oppression. I do not 
give this sentiment as that of the whole Patriotic party, 
who are far, very far from being united in their own politics. 
I cannot even pretend to say how extensive this temper may 
be, but from my observations hitherto, I cannot doubt but 
that numbers here would rather see the conquest of their 
country completed by the French, than a peace made by 
them with the government now established here. 
</p><p>
If therefore the French Republic will consent to terms of 
accommodation with the Stadtholder and the States General, upon condition that they shall abandon their alliance with Great Britain, the personal interest of the House 
of Orange and of the members of the States will dictate to 
them an acquiescence in the measure. The continuance 
of the war threatens immediate and total destruction to 
them, and it is not in the power of their ally, now they 
are abandoned by Prussia, and are like to be deserted 
by the Empire, to defend them. Example is epidemical 
among nations, no less than among individuals, and in 
this instance the court of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=berlin" rel="city">Berlin</a> will think itself justified 
by the imitation, and that of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a> deem itself authorized by the precedent. 
</p><p>
The mission of Mr. Fagel to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> is supposed to be 
upon this subject. But if his object is to agree upon a 
joint negotiation, there does not appear any possibility 
that this proposal will produce any effect. 
i The present British Ministry cannot with any consistency 
negotiate, and there is no present prospect of a change in 
the Administration. If this difficulty should be removed, another more insurmountable would occur, if the general 
opinion be well founded, that the Convention will not negotiate upon any terms with Great Britain. Whether this 
disposition, if it really exists, will continue for any length of 
time, it is impossible to say. It is founded upon the extreme 
animosity against the British, which prevails at this time in 
France. But the public sentiment is in its own nature very 
fluctuating. National passions subside when the objects 
which excited them are removed. The character of the 
French people, however susceptible of ardent resentment, 
is far from being implacable, and the transition in the public 
mind from the most virulent hatred to indifference, and 
even to good will, often takes place with surprising rapidity. 
A peace, therefore, even between these two mighty rivals 
before the opening of the spring, may possibly take place, 
but cannot be rationally expected in the present state of 
things. 
</p><p>
If then the perseverance of Britain, or the resentment of 
France, should effectually preclude a general pacification, 
will the government of this country negotiate a separate 
peace? In answer to this question I can only say that their 
external enemies are victorious, and if the war continues 
will in every probability be irresistible : that their internal 
disunion gives a strong hold to their invaders, even in the 
heart of their country; and that the question remaining 
for them is between an unpleasant peace and total ruin. If 
self preservation be to political bodies an obligation para 
mount to every other law, compact or stipulation, it can 
hardly be expected that the present alliance will be an in 
superable obstacle to a separate peace between the two 
Republics. 
</p><p>
The French have hitherto made no distinction between the 
different partizans in the places where they have obtained possession. The Stadtholderians and Patriots share the 
same treatment, and no alteration is made in the general order of things. These circumstances serve to strengthen 
the hopes of peace, while the dissensions between the Allies strengthen the desire for it. 
</p><p>
The English troops discriminate as little as the French. 
They have made themselves equally obnoxious to all parties, 
and plunder and illtreat the Stadtholderians as much as the 
Patriots. A gentleman professedly of the governing party 
told me the people were much more afraid of the English 
than of the French, and after a variety of other observations 
expressive of his fears exclaimed, Peace ! Peace ! We must 
have Peace ! The violence and misconduct of the British 
troops is a fact established beyond a question by a public 
proclamation issued by the Duke of York, which you will 
doubtless have seen in the late British papers. I have there 
fore not scrupled to mention it as a cause of complaint in 
the mouth of everyone here. As to the additional charges 
brought against them, implying a want of spirit as well as 
of conduct in them, and the imputation of their propensity 
to retreat, as well as the reports injurious to the imperitorial 
character of the Commander-in-Chief himself, representing 
him as indulging more in convivial pleasures than the extreme delicacy of his present situation renders proper, or 
the rigid severity of Dutch austerity deems decorous, I 
must consider all this as unwarranted scandal, which how 
ever prevalent may be altogether groundless, and only 
proves that the allies are very much dissatisfied with one another. 
</p><p>
The Duke of Brunswick is hourly expected to take the 
command and his arrival is ardently desired by those who 
think the system of resistance still practicable. 
</p><p>
The appearance of internal opposition to the government is entirely quelled for the present. Mr. Van Staphorst is at 
Hamborough, out of the reach of this jurisdiction. Mr. Visschcr is closely confined, and the subscribers to the petition I have more than once mentioned to you have suffered 
themselves to be disarmed without resistance. 
</p><p>
November 8. Mr. Van Hees the agent of their High Mightinesses called on me, to give me notice that they had 
passed a resolution to acknowledge me in my public character. After which I asked him whether there was any intelligence from the armies. Nimeguen he answered was 
heavily bombarded by the last accounts from thence, which were of yesterday. The news from Maastricht lie said was 
very bad. "It is pretended," said he, "that it capitulated on the 4th." I suppose therefore there is no doubt of the 
fact. I told him that probably the campaign must soon 
terminate. "It must come to an end soon somehow or 
other," said he. "What can be done when the allies abandon us ?" I asked him if the King of Prussia had certainly 
made peace? "So it is said, but the letters from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=berlin" rel="city">Berlin</a> deny 
it." What? The latest letters from thence. Generally, 
the letters from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=berlin" rel="city">Berlin</a>. He did not chuse, therefore, to 
answer my question as to the latest letters, yet the inference 
is not absolutely conclusive that they have letters from 
thence confirming the fact. 
</p><p>
I hope we shall soon have some agreeable intelligence from 
our own country. The western insurrection has a most 
disagreeable effect upon the credit and reputation of America. 
A thousand exaggerations of the fact are propagated with 
great avidity, our friends know not what to deny, the malevolence of our enemies is gratified, and the advocates of 
universal freedom and humanity are afraid of losing the 
only country for which they can appeal for the practicability 
of their theories. I hope we shall soon relieve them from their alarms, and shew them once more the perfect image 
of united liberty and submission. 
</p><p>
With every sentiment of respect I remain, Sir, your very 
</p><p>
humble and obedient servant.
