Mrs. Preston's story. As we walked home, she told me she had just been to see a lady she had known 
more than twenty years before. She had met her in this wise: One of the chambermaids of the St. Charles Hotel 
(New Orleans) told Mrs. Preston's nurse it was when Mary Preston was a baby that up among the servants in 
the garret there was a sick lady and her children. The maid was sure she was a lady, and thought she was hiding from 
somebody. Mrs. Preston went up, knew the lady, had her brought down into comfortable rooms, and nursed her 
until she recovered from her delirium and fever. She had run away, indeed, and was hiding herself and her children 
from a worthless husband. Now, she has one son in a Yankee prison, one mortally wounded, and the last of them 
dying there under her eyes of consumption. This last had married here in Richmond, not wisely, and too soon, for he 
was a mere boy; his pay as a private was eleven dollars a month, and his wife's family charged him three hundred 
dollars a month for her board; so he had to work double tides, do odd jobs by night and by day, and it killed him by 
exposure to cold in this bitter climate to which his constitution was unadapted.

They had been in Vicksburg during the siege, and during the bombardment sought refuge in a cave. The roar of 
the cannon ceasing, they came out gladly for a breath of 
fresh air. At the moment when they emerged, a bomb burst there, among them, so to speak, struck the son already 
wounded, and smashed off the arm of a beautiful little grandchild not three years old. There was this poor little 
girl with her touchingly lovely face, and her arm gone. This mutilated little martyr, Mrs. Preston said, was really to her 
the crowning touch of the woman's affliction. Mrs. Preston put up her hand, "Her baby face haunts me".
