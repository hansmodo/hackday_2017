SIR, 
</p><p>
Yesterday I had the honor to receive your Excellency's letter of the 14th ultimo, from <a href='/results.php?city=middlebrook' rel='city'>Middlebrook</a>. 
I am sorry to find your Excellency seems to have 
given over all thoughts of penetrating into Canada 
by the route of Coos, after the preparations made for 
that purpose, at an incredible expense. 
I am satisfied you could not have advised with 
two men, upon this Continent, better acquainted with 
the practicable routes to the River St. Lawrence, than 
General Bayley and Colonel Hazen, the latter being 
an officer of great merit and service, and who long 
resided upon the River Sorel ; and the former, the 
best of any acquainted with the country between 
Coos and Lake St. Peter's, who likewise has the most 
extensive influence upon the brave and numerous in 
habitants in the northern parts of the States which 
lie near Canada. As your Excellency advised with 
them, and determined upon the route by Coos, I beg 
leave to express my astonishment at the sudden 
change of your sentiments, and relinquishment of that 
plan. 
</p><p>
To go into Canada by Lake Champlain, before the 
enemy's fleet are taken or destroyed, is almost impracticable ; to attempt it by Lake Ontario, before 
Niagara is taken, and vessels upon that Lake are re 
moved, is still more difficult, as the Fort at La Galette must be reduced before the passage down the 
River St. Lawrence is open to Montreal. I believe 
that, in the present state of our army, and the actual 
situation of our magazines, to attempt a serious invasion of Canada, by whatever route, would prove unsuccessful, unless the fleet of our allies should, at the 
same time, cooperate with us, by sailing up the River 
St. Lawrence. In that case, the enemy's force would 
all (their fleet excepted) move down the river, to 
succour Quebec ; and our armament from Coos, assisted by the Canadians, who would flock to meet us, 
might march in the utmost security from Coos to 
Lake St. Peter s. The Upper Canada would then be 
wholly ours, and the English fleet on Lake Champlain, thus rendered useless, would be destroyed by its own crews, before these should be ordered down 
the river, to make the best of their way to Quebec. 
</p><p>
I much lament the amazing and needless expense 
that is incurred by the preparations making on the 
upper part of Hudson's River; for, I am confident, 
no force of ours can get into Canada by either of the 
routes from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, in <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>. 
</p><p>
The last paragraph of your Excellency's letter 
alarms me exceedingly. There is no magazine of 
flour in all these States ; and to have no hopes of 
procuring one, either by land or sea, is a most melancholy consideration. 
</p><p>
The Navy Board, here, just now acquainted me 
with their having lost all hopes of any supply of 
rice from South Carolina, that State having laid an 
embargo on that article. With very great respect 
and esteem, I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,
