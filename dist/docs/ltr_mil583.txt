Romancoke - April 22nd
</p><p>
My dear Emily
</p><p>
I have been here six weeks alone with Rob - & leave tomorrow with a heavy heart - for I always hate to leave him in his solitary home. Not for long however- as I spend a few days in Richmond, & then he joins me & we go to Ravensworth, Burkes Station - Fairfax Co , where you must write to me. How are you? And what are you doing! Flirting I fear with some of yr old admirers!
</p><p>
Our letters crossed Xmas - & I have been counting on your generosity to write again! I have been living in the nubia all winter! To Washington - to balls, & dinners, & receptions - here in country drives, when the wind is blowing. I had a lovely time in Washington - courted & feted by the Swells! But no heart episodes, as in dear darling New Orleans - city of love & roses! I saw the Misses Davis there, & was invited to one of thier handsome entertainments. Mrs Cleveland was very polite - named her pet cat after me! Rose Elizabeth Cleveland honored one wish with her friendship! Friends abounded but no loves alas! Is their season over for me - for me! God forbid! I am going to Europe in May! Yes - I am off at last - but will return I hope soon.
</p><p>
I have been busy here - setting to rights as usual - & trying to teach these wretched darkies to be clean, & not filthy! Hopeless - futile task! As well turn the stars from thier orbits! I have made up beds - scoured floors, washed windows with them - but when my back is turned - they return to thier old way! Rob has a sweet place - & everything but a wife - to drill & take care of his menage. Write me all yr news. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfl" rel="sibling met">Fitzhugh</a> & Tabb have been on a visit to Custis
