Sir, 
</p><p>
I am exceedingly unhappy when I view the critical situation of the interest of the United States, and 
the great evils which attend the people in this quarter by the unhappy internal broils and contentions, 
caused by the disputes between them and the several 
adjacent States, which prevent that line of correspondence with your Excellency necessary to make the common interest become mutual, and which, I 
am not insensible, puts it out of your Excellency's 
power to hold such correspondence as, I presume, 
from your known humanity and warm attachment to 
the liberties of mankind, would be otherwise granted 
with pleasure. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding I esteem it my duty to inform 
your Excellency of the perseverance of the inhabitants of this State in the grand cause of liberty in 
which they have embarked, and of the high estimation they entertain of your Excellency's eminent services as Commander-in-chief of the American arms 
(not to flatter), I am wanting in language to express their feelings. I can only assure your Excellency that nothing impedes their willingness to support your Excellency in the important trust of Commander-in-chief, at the risk of every thing dear to 
them, but a want of being assured, at the end, of 
sharing equal privileges with the United States. 
</p><p>
It gives me pain to give your Excellency any intelligence which ma}, in the least, add to your burden. But duty to my country, and self-preservation, 
make it become necessary to present an official account of our situation in this quarter, so far as respects the interest of the common cause ; for which I 
refer your Excellency to the inclosed letters, which 
are copies of those sent, as therein specified, and will 
give a particular relation of the subject. 
</p><p>
I can only mention further to your Excellency, 
that many prisoners, inhabitants of this State, are in 
the custody of the enemy in Canada; and that, notwithstanding we have taken more than three times 
the number from them, it is at present out of our 
power to return equal numbers, having delivered 
prisoners so taken, from time to time, to the United States. We are about settling a cartel for the redemption of our men in Canada, as before mentioned. 
I must, therefore, beg your Excellency's indulgence 
with a sufficient number of prisoners to answer such 
an exchange, should the Commissioners, appointed for 
that purpose, agree. Should this proposal meet your 
Excellency's approbation, a return of the number 
shall be immediately transmitted, and a compliance 
with any reasonable requisition that may be necessary 
to complete a matter so earnestly wished for by. Sir, 
your Excellency's most respectful 
</p><p>
And most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
