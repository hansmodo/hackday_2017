</p><p>
ON BOARD THE SLOOP DOLPHIN AT THE MOUTH OF ELK RIVER March the 9th <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1781">1781</a> 
</p><p>
My Dear Sir 
</p><p>
When your favor of the y h Came to Hand we were just embarked for our Voyage, and Before I am launched into the Bay, I will answer to the articles which your letter Contains 
</p><p>
The place of debarkation, My dear friend, is as I told you at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, in some place about Portsmouth which will Be determined on our Arrival at Hampton Road There I Hope to 
Meet some of our Allies, and immediately to Act Against the forces under <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="colleague">Arnold</a> our little fleet under Convoy of Armed Vessels is going to Annapolis where I Hope to be met 
By a french frigat But the general directs me to keep this plan very secret. 
</p><p>
By what you write to me, My dear Sir, you Cannot Have a detachement Ready at Head of Elk Before the 2O lh , and your presence May Be 
wanting to put the others in Motion But I would Be very desirous of Availing Myself of your Advices and exertions as soon as you Could 
make up any detachement whatsoever When on the other Hand, in Case we make a Coup de main of the attack at portsmouth I would not Have 
you to take the trouble of going to the purpose to much out of your Way 
</p><p>
I will Be at portsmouth and a letter May Be Back at the Head of Elk Before you Can possibly move a body of 400 men from my Conversation with the Commanders of french forces 
I may Be able to know if you Have Time to join us, and the intelligence will Be immediately forwarded I think a good place for your Rendezvous would be such a one as May Con 
duct you to Virginia Both By Alexandria and Head of Elk But am to far from Hoping that your Troops May Arrive in Time, that 
I would Be sorry too much to divert vour attention from the first object of your destination 
</p><p>
With the Most sincere affection and Regard I Have the Honor to be Dear Sir 
</p><p>
Yours 
</p><p>

Be pleased to let the quarter master at Head of Elk know where He is to send my letter to you
