My dear General, 
</p><p>
I was, in the evening of the 23d, honored with 
your Excellency's favor of the 11th. No measure 
has been left untried to save the question for filling 
up our battalions for the war; but every attempt of 
its abettors for that purpose (and many there were 
in the Assembly) proved abortive. The following 
short anecdote will point your Excellency to some, 
and, I think, the principal reasons on which the 
question was lost. A venerable gray-headed old gentleman, who has lost two sons in the war, rose in the Assembly, and observed that the army must be 
filled up, and by our own children, who were afraid 
of becoming slaves, which they supposed might be 
the case if they engaged for the war. "We have," 
continued the old gentleman, " sons now grown up, 
who will readily engage for three years, and, by the 
time their services shall expire, others, now young, 
will be ready to take their places." These ideas so 
fully possessed the minds of the country members, 
that they supposed every attempt to fill up the army 
for the war would be ineffectual, serve only to waste 
the time, and probably prevent its being done, even 
for three years. 
</p><p>
Though I am myself convinced that the measure is 
wrong, and that we had better have tried to have 
raised part of the number in the first place, and 
those for the war, yet I have the pleasing satisfaction to be fully convinced that those who were of a 
different opinion acted from the purest motives, and 
the fullest conviction that it was the most elioible. 
Notwithstanding the vote passed to raise the men 
for three years, or for the war, yet I have great 
hopes, from the encouragement given to them to engage for the war, in addition to the sum to be given 
for a three years' enlistment, and. from the disposition I find in the seaports in favor of the former 
measure, that great exertions will be made by them 
and others to carry it into execution. Indeed, this 
town has already secured about one third of its men 
for this term, and expect thus to secure the remainder. 
</p><p>
The Assembly meets next week ; and, if there is 
the most distant prospect that, on a revival of the 
question, it will share a different fate from its last, 
I am positive it will be renewed. 
</p><p>
By looking back into the state of onr finances, 
and forward to the expenses which will necessarily 
be incurred the next campaign, it is found that part 
of them must be provided for by direct borrowing. 
This, I think, will have a very happy effect ; for, before we can be again trusted, we must rescind some 
former resolutions, which have not given all that protection and support to creditors which, perhaps, the 
Legislative body intended they should give ; and 
adopt an enlarged system of politics, pregnant with 
the highest justice, the most permanent security to 
individuals. This will give dignity to Government, 
array the Legislature with confidence, and clothe the 
Executive with strength and vigor ; for a government whose resolutions are equal will as certainly 
find support, as that men regard, and steadily pursue, their own happiness. 
</p><p>
I am much surprised to hear that there is so scanty an allowance of clothing in camp, as we have had, 
for so long a time, not only a good supply on hand 
in Europe and the West Indies, but, as I have the 
greatest reason to believe, a sufficiency of clothes 
within this State, brought in by our privateers, to 
clothe our army at any time within these five months 
past, five times over. Our finances, I know, are in a 
miserable situation; but I cannot believe that those 
of the several States are in so ruinous a condition 
as to prevent the purchase of so necessary an article. 
</p><p>
Though it always gives me pain to offer a sentiment, which may in the least cast a censure upon 
Congress, for I know they are embarrassed, and are 
not supported as the best good of the public evidently dictates, yet I cannot but suggest my belief, 
that the want of proper arrangements, in some degree 
occasioned those distresses of our army, consequent 
upon a want of clothing. Either the Continental 
agents should purchase the whole for the army at 
large, or the several States should be left entirely to 
clothe their own troops, without the least interference 
of the agents; for, so long as it is the joint business 
of the agents and the respective States, a mutual reliance will occasion a failure of exertion in each. 
The former method is much to be preferred, because 
there would be a greater uniformity in the clothing 
of the troops, which will, among other conveniences, 
serve to prevent the existence of jealousies, arising 
from an apprehension of different usage. If an idea 
has ever been held up, that the Continental army is 
but the union of thirteen different armies, having different interests, and, in some degree, different pursuits, and of course, that good policy requires that 
each State should secure the affections of their own 
troops, and attach them to her particular interest, 
every step I wish might be taken to bury the sentiment in oblivion, and every measure tending to support it, if another can as conveniently be adopted, be 
by no means executed. 
</p><p>
This, then, will stand as another reason why the 
Continent should clothe the troops of the respective 
States, or rather their own army. The business of 
clothing the army is exceedingly loose and irregular, 
so far that this State, even at this late hour, are uncertain, whether Congress expect that they are to 
clothe their own troops, independent of them, or not. 
As it is a matter of great importance, I hope Congress will be explicit and decided on this point. It 
is particularly necessary that they should be so, as it 
is supposed, here, that the late requisition of Congress 
for the specific articles and cash, together with what they draw from the new emission, is the whole demand on this State ; and, as I said before, part of 
this expense must be provided for b}'' borrowing. 
Should Congress think it most expedient that this 
State, or the several States, should clothe their own 
troops and credit them for the expense, in the present requisition, I am confident that if they give 
orders to this State for this purpose, they will be 
immediately executed. 
</p><p>
Colonel Henly assures me, that the goods are here, and that an immediate supply for the whole army 
can be obtained. Some have been offered him on credit. He has no orders to purchase. 
</p><p>
To clothe all the troops of the Continent can now, 
I think, be easily effected. The inclosed will show 
your Excellency, what quantity of clothing has been 
lately sent on, and what remains on hand. I hope 
the matter will not be delayed a single moment, from 
an expectation of our receiving what we have in Europe, or the West Indies. The danger of the seas, 
and the risk of capture, are too great to justify the 
least suspension. Indeed, was it to arrive at the hour 
of our procuring a full supply, should we even then 
have more on hand than sound policy would direct? 
I believe not; but am rather of opinion that a provident people, under our circumstances, would store 
three times the quantity. If, on the whole, we should 
be ordered to clothe our own troops, I wish your 
Excellency's directions whether, if it can soon be 
effected, the recruits should be detained in the mean 
time, or marched on, without delay, to camp. In either 
case, I conceive it will be necessary to send a number 
of officers to Springfield, and to this town, as those 
will probably be the two principal places at which the troops will rendezvous; for, if we mean to keep 
them from straggling, marauding, and wasting their 
time, they must be sent in bodies under proper 
officers. It appears to me, that it will be also necessary to detain some of the arms now here and which 
are ordered on, to be put into the hands of those on 
whom we can depend. They will serve as a guard 
to others of a different character. 
</p><p>
The General Court have ordered, to each man, one 
dollar a mile, to enable him to march to camp ; but 
it is so far short of the real expense, that it will 
answer no valuable purpose. Indeed, if it was adequate, I think no good would arise from the measure ; 
for, I am confident, the men will not be got to camp 
unless they are marched under the care of proper 
officers, and different magazines established on the 
route, at which the men can be regularly supplied. 
I think there should be one in this town, one in 
Worcester, one in Springfield, and one in <a href='/results.php?city=litchfield' rel='city'>Litchfield</a>. 
If your Excellency should be of opinion that the 
measure is necessary, I wish you would suggest it 
to the Governor, who, ever disposed to do right, 
doubts the propriety of his ordering these magazines 
from the specific articles called for by Congress. If 
these are not taken, it will be difficult to establish 
them. 
</p><p>
There are some matters to be attended to here, in 
the military way, which seem to be the particular 
business of your Excellency, as Commander-in-chief, 
or the Commanding Officer in a separate department. 
Am I, Sir, as senior officer here, competent to such 
business ? If I am not, and further powers from 
your Excellency should be necessary, and you should 
think proper to grant them, I hope, if it can be avoided, an idea of my being Commanding Officer in 
this department will not be held up. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
