AUGUSTA, June 11th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1830">1830</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR: I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 7th instant, and the 
copy papers enclosed with it. The papers will be shown to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>, 
and no other use made of them by me. 
</p><p>
I did not intend to convey to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> the idea that any personal communication ever took place between us, prior to the date of Mr. Crawford's 
letter, relative to the occurrences in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Monroe's</a> cabinet on the question 
of the Seminole war. What I intended he should know, and I suppose will 
now understand, if I have inadvertently misled him, is, that I did not volunteer to procure the information contained in Mr. Crawford's letter, but that 
it was obtained for your use in compliance with your request. Major Hamilton requested me in your name, to give to you what I had previously given 
to him Mr. Crawford's account of the transactkm. With this request I 
Complied, after having first obtained Mr. Crawford's consent, and received 
from him his correction of a mistake I had made in repeating his verbal 
statement. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="me">JOHN FORSYTH</a>. 
</p><p>
Gen. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">ANDREW JACKSON</a>, President of the United States.
