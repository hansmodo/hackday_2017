My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency having personally seen our dispositions, I shall only give you an account of what 
passed in the execution. Colonel Gimat's battalion 
led the van, and was followed by that of Colonel 
Hamilton, who commanded the whole advanced corps. 
At the same time, a party of eighty men, under <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Laurens</a>, turned the redoubt. I beg leave to refer your Excellency to the report I have received 
from <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Hamilton</a>, whose well-known talents and 
gallantry were on this occasion most conspicuous and 
serviceable. Our obligation to him, to Colonel Gimat, 
to <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Laurens</a>, and to each and all the officers 
and men, are above expression. Not one gun was 
fired; and the ardor of the troops did not give time 
for the sappers to derange the abatis; and, owing to 
the conduct of the Commanders and bravery of the 
men, the redoubt was stormed with an uncommon rapidity. 
</p><p>
Colonel Barber's battalion, which was the first in 
the supporting column, being detached for the aid of 
the advance, arrived at the moment they were getting over the works, and executed then orders with 
the utmost alacrity. The Colonel was slightly wounded. The rest of the column, under Generals Muhlenberg and Hazen, advanced with admirable firmness 
and discipline. Colonel Yose's battalion displayed to 
the left, a part of the division successively dressing 
by him, whilst a kind of second line was forming 
columns in the rear. It adds greatly to the character of the troops, that, under the fire of the enemy, 
they displayed and took their ranks with perfect 
silence and order. 
</p><p>
Give me leave particularly to mention Major Barber, Division Lispector, who distinguished himself, and 
received a wound from a cannon ball. 
</p><p>
Li making the arrangement for the support of the 
works we had reduced, I was happy to find <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a> and the Pennsylvanians so situated as to 
have given us, in case of need, the most effectual 
support. I have the honor to be, with the most perfect respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
