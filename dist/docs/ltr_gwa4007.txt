Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The letters which you did me the favour of writing to 
me on the 17th and 23d of last month from <a href='/results.php?city=poughkeepsie' rel='city'>Poughkeepsie</a>, 
came duly to hand, and claim my particular acknowledgments. 
</p><p>
With peculiar pleasure I now congratulate you on the 
success of your labours to obtain an unconditional ratification of the proposed constitution in the Convention of your 
State, the account of which was brought to us by the mail 
of yesterday. 
</p><p>
Although I could hardly conceive it possible, after ten 
States had adopted the constitution, that New- York, separated as it is from the remaining three, and so peculiarly 
divided in sentiments as it is, would withdraw herself from 
the union, yet considering the great majority which appeared 
to cling together in the < Convention, and the decided temper 
of the leaders in the opposition, I did not, I confess, see the 
means by which it was to be avoided. 
</p><p>
The exertion of those who were able to effect this great 
work, must have been equally arduous and meritorious. It 
is to be hoped that the State of North Carolina will not 
spend much time in deciding on this question, and as to 
Rhode Island, its conduct hitherto has so far baffled all 
calculation, that few are disposed to hazard a conjecture 
thereon. 
</p><p>
With sentiments of the sincerest esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and affectionate servant, 
</p><p>
