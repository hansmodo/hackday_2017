DEAR SIR : I received yours of Aug. 24 by Capt Vanderhorst, to whom I should willingly have shown any Civilities 
in my Power, but I being goutly of late, seldom go into the 
City, and he has not called on me since he delivered your 
Letter. I am sorry you talk of leaving off your Business 
with a View of getting some Post. It is so difficult a matter 
to obtain anything of the kind, that I think to leave a good 
Trade in hopes of an Office, is quitting a Certainty for an 
Uncertainty, and losing Substance for Shadow. I have 
known so many here dangling and soliciting Years for Places, 
till they were reduced to the lowest Poverty and Distress, that 
I cannot but pity a Man who begins to turn his Thoughts 
that way. The Proverb says; He who has a Trade has an Office of Profit and Honour; because he does not hold it 
during any other Man's Pleasure, and it affords him honest 
Subsistence with Independence. I hope, therefore, you will 
alter your mind and go on with your Business. I assure you 
it is not in my Power to procure you that Post you mention 
or any other, whatever my wishes may be for your Prosperity. 
I am now thought here too much an American to have any 
Interest of the kind. You have done me Honour in giving 
a Son my Name. I wish he may live to be an Honour and 
Comfort to you. With my Compliments to Mrs. Timothy, I am ever, 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, etc. B. F.
