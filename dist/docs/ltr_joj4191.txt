Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the friendly letter, and for the book which you was so obliging as to send me by my son. I have made some progress in reading it. The principle I 
approve, and am glad it has employed a pen very able to do it justice. 
</p><p>
Had all uninspired expositors been content with the simplicity of the gospel, and not been wise above what is written, the Church would probably have suffered less than it 
has from worldly wisdom and scholastic subtleties. 
</p><p>
With the best wishes for the health and prosperity of 
yourself and family, I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your friend, 
</p><p>
