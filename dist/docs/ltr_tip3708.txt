Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency had but just left my quarters this 
evening, when a Deputy-Sheriff of Ulster arrested me. 
He showed me a writ, of which I beg leave to inclose a copy. To prevent any injury to the public, 
by taking me from my office, I gave bail, and have 
wrote to an attorney to defend the suit. 
</p><p>
I thought it my duty to apprise your Excellency 
of this event. The plaintiff is a Melancthon L. Woolsey. I do not know him, nor ever heard his name 
before ; but a gentleman, who happens to be at my 
office, tells me that he is a trader at <a href='/results.php?city=poughkeepsie' rel='city'>Poughkeepsie</a>, 
who has been purchasing up specie certificates (signed 
by me, and issued pursuant to an act of Congress of 
the 23d of August, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>), at a very great discount. 
</p><p>
The suit, therefore, is doubtless grounded on such 
certificates. But, on the same ground, some thousands of suits may be brought against me in this 
State alone. 
</p><p>
Congress, by an act of the 19th of March, <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a>, 
recommended to the several States to pass laws to 
exempt public officers from such suits. Some complied with the recommendation. This State deliberated upon it, and a bill passed the Assembly; but the 
Council of Revision offered objections, and it was 
dropped. To subject public officers to such actions, 
is doubtless cruel oppression. At the same time, 
the community is burdened with a great expense. If 
such suits be multiplied, and the numerous public 
creditors have all as just cause of action, they cannot 
even benefit the prosecutors ; for the property of pub
</p><p>
lie officers, compared with the vastness of the public 
debts, is but as the small dust of the balance. There 
is but one class of people who can derive advantage 
from such prosecutions. They, indeed, will reap a 
rich harvest, if all, or a majority of the public creditors, become equally unreasonable with the few that 
have hitherto commenced such suits. With the writ, 
the Sheriff presented me a letter from Mr. Benson, of 
which the inclosed is a copy. 
</p><p>
I am singularly unfortunate in being subjected to 
suits on specie certificates ; for it was at my instance 
that Congress passed the act authorizing me to issue 
them. My motive was to do the best possible justice to the public creditors, by fixing their dues in 
specie, and allowing them the interest of their money, 
which I saw it was impossible for the public promptly 
to pay. I am, with the greatest respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
