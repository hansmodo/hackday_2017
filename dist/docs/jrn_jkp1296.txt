About six o'clock P.M. I learned that the Senate had expelled Mr. Ritchie from the privileged seats of that body, in consequence of the publication in the Union a few days ago over the signature of "Vindicator." It is a second Duane case, and strikes a blow at the liberty of the press. The foul deed was perpetrated by the votes of the undivided Federal Senators, and Senators Calhoun and Butler of South Carolina and Yulee and Westcott of Florida. These four gentlemen constitute what Senator Turney denominated in debate a few days ago the  Balance of Power party. They have more frequently voted with the Federalists than the Democrats during this session.

After night an unusual number of members of Congress called. They were Democrats and were most excited at the expulsion of Mr. Ritchie from the Senate today. I learn that the public opinion and sympathies are all enlisted in his behalf, and that this act of the Senate is condemned by public opinion, as far as it has been expressed in the city.
