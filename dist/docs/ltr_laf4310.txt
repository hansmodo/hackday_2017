My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
Although I cannot omit an opportunity of writing 
to you, my letter will not be so long and minute as 
I should like to make it, because of the constant 
hurry of business occasioned by the Assembly. Every clay, Sundays excepted, is taken up with General meetings. Committees, and smaller Boards, It is a 
pretty extraordinary sight at Versailles; the more so, 
as a great deal of patriotism and firmness have been 
displayed. 
</p><p>
From the time of this King's arrival to the throne, 
the expenses of the treasury have been increased 
about two hundred French millions a year ; but it 
went at such a rate under M. de Calonne, that, having got a monstrous deficiency, and knowing not how 
to fill it up, he persuaded the King to assemble notable persons of each order, to please them with a 
plan of Assemblies in each Province, which was much 
desired, and to get their approbation for new taxes, 
with which he durst not, by himself, saddle the 
nation. 
</p><p>
The Assembly was very properly chosen, both for honesty, abilities, and personal consequence. But M. de Calonne much depended on his own powers of 
speaking and intriguing, as well as on the King's blind confidence in him and all his plans. We were not the representatives of the nation ; but have been 
supported by their partiality to us. 
</p><p>
Calonne's plan of Provincial Assemblies has been 
amended by us. His plan of a tax has been rejected. 
It has been the case with several other projects. 
Some others were altered for the better, and sometimes new ones substituted ; and we declared that, 
although we had no right to impede, it was our right 
not to advise, unless we thought the measure were 
proper, and that we could not think of new taxes 
unless we knew the returns of expenditure and the 
plans of economy. The more we entered into the 
business, the less possible it was for the Ministry to 
do without us. To the Assembly the public looked 
up ; and, had the Assembly been dismissed, the credit was gone. As we were going to separate for the 
Easter days, I made a motion to inquire into bargains, by which, under pretence of exchange, millions 
had been lavished upon Princes and favorites. The 
Bishop of Langres seconded my motion. It was 
thought proper to intimidate us; and the King's brother told, in his Majesty's name, that such motions 
ought to be signed, upon which I signed the inclosed. 
</p><p>
M. de Calonne went up to the King, to ask I 
should be confined to the Bastille. An oratory battle was announced between us for the next meeting ; 
and I was getting the proofs of what I had advanced, 
when Calonne was overthrown from his post; and so 
our dispute ended, except that the King and family, 
and the great men about Court, some friends excepted, 
do not forgive me for the liberties I have taken, and 
the success it had among the other classes of the 
people. 
</p><p>
M. de Calonne's successor was M. de Fourqueux, 
an old man, who lasted but a fortnight ; and now we 
have got the Archbishop of Toulouse at the head of 
affairs, a man of the most upright honesty and shining abilities. M. de Villedeuil, a clever man, will act 
under him; and we may consider the Archbishop as 
a Prime IMinister. 
</p><p>
We are going to have good Houses of Representatives in each Province ; not to vote the taxes, but 
to divide them. We have got the King to make reductions and improvements to the amount of forty 
millions of livres a year. We are proposing the 
means to insure a better and more public method of 
administration ; but shall be obliged, in the end, to 
make loans and lay taxes. The Assembly have acted 
with firmness and patriotism. The walls of Versailles 
had never heard so many good things; and our meeting, particularly in the alarming situation of affairs, 
when the Kingdom was driving away, like Phaeton's 
car, will have proved very beneficial. 
</p><p>
I have been much hurt to hear that the unpaid 
interest of the American debt was considered as a 
very uncertain revenue. I said every thing that was 
proper on this subject ; but could not prevent that 
being considered as a fact, which, hitherto, has proved 
but too true. Full justice has been done to the 
security of the capital ; but the punctuality of the 
interest has been animadverted upon. M. de Calonne's 
letter has met with some diflficulties from the farmers, which are going to be settled, so that the merchants need not be uneasy. The cloud that was 
gathering on the Turks and Russians is, for the moment, clearing up. 
</p><p>
My health has been deranged during the Assembly, so far as to endanger a little my breast ; but a 
good regimen, and a little patience, without interrupting public business, have got me in a very fair 
way. Inclosed is a copy of my signed motion, which 
I find in a newspaper. I would have translated it ; 
but you will very easily have it done. When the 
opinions of the several Committees shall be printed, 
I will send them to America. 
</p><p>
My most affectionate respects, and those of Madame de Lafayette and family, wait on Mrs. Washington and you, my dear General. Remember me to 
the whole family and all friends. Most respectfully 
and tenderly I have the honor to be, my beloved 
General, 
</p><p>
Your most devoted and grateful friend,

P. S. M. St. John de Crevecoeur, the French Consul at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, has requested my recommendation 
for some information he wishes to have. I assured 
him you would have no objections. Tarleton has printed a journal of the campaigns he has made, wherein 
he treats Lord Cornwallis ver}'- severely.
