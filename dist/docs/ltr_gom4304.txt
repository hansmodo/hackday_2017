Sir, 
</p><p>
I arrived in this city on Saturday evening, the 27th of March, and called the next morning on the 
Duke of Leeds, Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was not at home. I therefore wrote to him a note, a copy whereof is inclosed, as also liis answer, received 
that evening. On Monday, the 29th, I waited upon 
him at Whitehall, and, after the usual compliments, 
presented your letter, telling him that it would explain the nature of my business. Having read it, he 
said, with much warmth and gladness in his appearance, " I am very happy, Mr. Morris, to see this letter, and under the President's own hand. I assure 
you it is very much my wish to cultivate a friendly 
and commercial intercourse between the two countries; 
and more, I can answer for that of his Majesty's 
servants, that they are of the same opinion." " I am 
happy, my Lord, to find that such sentiments prevail ; 
for we are too near neighbours not to be either 
good friends or dangerous enemies." " You are perfectly right. Sir ; and certainly it is to be desired, as 
well for our mutual interests as for the peace and 
happiness of mankind, that we should be upon the 
best footing." 
</p><p>
I assured him of our sincere disposition to be upon 
good terms, and then proceeded to mention those 
points in the treaty of peace which remained to be 
performed. And first, I observed that, by the Constitution of the United States, which he had certainly 
read, all obstacles to the recovery of British debts 
are removed ; and that if any doubts could have remained, they are now done away by the organization 
of a Federal Court, which has cognizance of causes 
arising under the treaty. He said, he was happy to 
receive this information; that he had been of opinion, 
and had written to <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague'>Mr. Adams</a>, that the articles ought 
to be performed in the order in which they stood in 
the treaty. Not choosing to enter into any discussion of his conduct in relation to <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague'>Mr. Adams</a>, I told 
his Grace that I had one rule or principle for public 
and private life, in conformity to which I had always 
entertained the idea that it would consist most with 
the dignity of the United States, first, to perform all 
their stipulations, and then to require such performance from others ; and that, in effect, if each party 
were on mutual covenants to suspend its compliance, 
expecting that of the other, all treaties would be illusory. He agreed in this sentiment. Upon which I 
added, that the United States had now placed themselves in the situation just mentioned. 
</p><p>
And here I took occasion to observe, that the 
Southern States, which had been much blamed in 
this country for obstructing the recovery of British 
debts, were not liable to all the severity of censure 
which had been thrown upon them ; that, their negroes having been taken or seduced away, and the 
payment for those negroes having been stimlated by 
treaty, they had formed a reliance on such payment 
for the discharge of debts contracted with British 
merchants, both previously and subsequently to the 
war ; that the suspension of this resource had occasioned a deficiency of means, so that their conduct 
had been dictated by an overruling necessity. 
</p><p>
Returning then to the main business, I observed, that as we had now fully performed our part, it was proper to mention that two articles remained to be fulfilled by them, namely, that which related to the 
posts, and that regarding a compensation for the negroes ; unless, indeed, they had sent out orders respecting the former, subsequent to the writing of 
your letter ; and I took the liberty to consider that 
as a very probable circumstance. He now became a little embarrassed, and told me that he could not exactly say how that matter stood. That as to the 
affair of the negroes, he had long wished to have it brought up, and to have something done, but something or other had always interfered. He then changed the conversation ; but I brought it back, and he 
changed it again. Hence it was apparent that he could go no farther than general professions and assurances. 
</p><p>
I then told him that there w^as a little circumstance, which had operated very disagreeably upon 
the feelings of America. Here he interrupted me. 
" I know what you are going to say ; our not sending a Minister. I wished to send you one ; but then 
I wished to have a man every way equal to the task, 
a man of abilities, and one agreeable to the people 
of America. But it w^as difficult. It is a great way 
off, and many object on that score." I expressed my 
persuasion, that this country could not want men well 
qualified for every office ; and he again changed the 
conversation. Wherefore, as it was not worth while 
to discuss the winds and the weather, I observed that 
he might probably choose to consider the matter a 
little, and to read again the treaty, and compare it 
with the American Constitution. He said that he 
should, and wished me to leave your letter, which he 
would have copied, and return it to me. I did so, 
telling him that I should be very glad to have a 
speedy answer; and he promised that I should. 
</p><p>
Thus, Sir, this matter was begun. But nine days 
have since elapsed, and I have heard nothing farther 
from the Duke of Leeds. It is true that Easter holidays have intervened, and that public business is, in 
general, suspended during that period. I shall give 
them sufficient time to show whether they are as well disposed as he has declared, and then give him 
a hint. Before I saw him, I communicated to the French Ambassador, in confidence, that you had directed ihg to call for a performance of the treaty. He 
told me at once that they would not give up the posts. Perhaps he may he right. I thought it host 
to make such communication; because the thing itself cannot remain a secret j an^ by mentioning it to him, we are enabled to say with truth, that, in every 
step relating to the treaty of peace, we have acted confidentially in regard to our ally. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.,
