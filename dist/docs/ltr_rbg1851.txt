TO BENJAMIN GRATZ
</p><p>
It was a great happiness to hear from you My Dear Brother- at a time when we know how troubled you are  
about the state of our country- and the uncertainties that perplex and agitate your community- it is bad enough here- 
where every days account is of war & outrages incident to war- but the minds of the people are made up, and their 
energies seem all directed to one point- while you have to struggle and keep watch over the disaffected- May God 
watch over the Union- and help those who labor for its preservation- Lizzie Lee & her boy left us this morning she left 
her husband at Brooklyn on the point of sailing a week ago, but he has been detained longer than he expected and she 
went home to day, taking Miss Jesup with her, her sister Mrs James Blair has her family at Bethlehem for the season, 
or until <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> is more quiet & safe- Henry Etting goes to sea also, in the Colorado, fitting at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>- all the other 
able men of the family are drilling in the "home guard" and Gary away in the western army keeps our interest alive in 
all quarters- .... I thank you my dear Ben for wishing to pay us a visit- but indeed I would not have you undergo the 
perils & anxiety of a journey or have you absent from your family on any account. Thank God, my health is good and 
my strength rapidly improving- I walked a few squares yesterday without fatigue- and when the weather is fair hope 
to resume my habit of daily exercise- Major Mordecai's family are at present at Dr Hays'- not yet determined 
whether to take lodgings in the country for the summer, or a small house in town & get settled at once- it is a hard condition they are reduced to, but they all bear it wonderfully well, considering the change from the luxurious home, at Wahcoleet- . . . 
</p><p>
Give my love to dear Ann & the girls- .... I am grateful that we are not cut off from the comfort of hearing from 
you- our relations here are as usual & always desire to be remembered to you 
</p><p>
God Bless you My Dear brother, ever with devoted affection
