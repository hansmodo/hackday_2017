My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
On my return here a day or two since from a short visit to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> I found your highly esteemed & interesting letter of the 12th  ult 
Some one or two were rec d from you previously which were not replied 
to, as Betty vas about writing to Ann when they came to hand, & as I 
was overburdened with my correspondence, I requested her to state to you 
through Ann, that I had received them, besides which she communicated 
all that was of any interest here as regarded family matters & local affairs, 
which was worthy of notice 
</p><p>
Alth I can truly say that I felt neither exultation or gratification so 
far as I was individually concerned at the result of the late presidential 
contest, yet I sincerely thank you & dear Ann for your kind congratulations on acct of my success in reaching the office in question, which I look 
upon more as a bed of thorns than one of roses & however strang it may 
appear I would greatly prefer could the mantle have fallen on some one 
of the distinguished Whigs I could name instead of myself 
</p><p>
My election has no dout astonished those in power, who resorted to 
every measure to break me down as far as they could do so, when in a 
foreign country in front of the enemy, & to destroy me by the vilest 
slanders of the most unprincipled demagouges this or any other nation 
ever was cursed with, who have pursued me like blood-hounds up to the 
present moment, & who will continue to do so, as long as their employers 
or masters will it, notwithstanding the signal rebuke they have met with 
from a majority of the free & independent voters of the country ; the 
maxim is a correct one that the sovrign people when left to thems rarely err, 
& the recent election proves that even when every effort is resorted to on the 
part of their rulars to mislead & deceive them, they are capable of judging for themselves & shewing their servants who they placed in high 
places that they are capable of judging for themselves & deciding who 
shall rule over them 
</p><p>
I was aware you would as well as Ann be highly gratified to hear 
from John, & hope you have received from him an other letter ere this, 
& that he is getting on as well as could be expected ; I am anxious to 
know he is getting on with his new commander, of which he appeared to 
have some doubts as regarding doing so, as well as he had done, with 
those he had previously sailed with ; but I hope for the best 
</p><p>
We are truly pleased to learn Rob & the youg ladies were all well at 
Emmitsburg, & that they are making as rapid progress in the several 
branches of education they are pursuing as could be expected ; & that the 
girls can remain there to advantage until their education is for the most 
part completed I was quite pleased to hear that the Col & family were 
all well, which I hope continues to be the case ; R. Allison I learn is 
threatened with consumption, & been advised to go to Cuba, & suppose 
he has left for that Island ere this 
</p><p>
Genl & Mrs Gaines I learn are expected in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> very soon, & 
that he is to command this division when I leave it Dr Jarvis got here 
day before yesterday on his way to the Rio Grande, & spent the day with 
us & then continued on to the city ; he stated he saw you in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> 
when on his way out from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">N. York</a>, but not Ann, who was suffering with 
a swollen face, since when a letter has reached here from her of the 
26 th ult to Betty in which she says she was suffering with a cold & soar 
throat ; I truly hope she will be relieved from both, & restored to health 
before this reaches you Jarvis complains a little at the arrangements 
made at Washington by the head of the medical dep but appears to 
doubt whether it could be avoided, & acts the part of a philosopher ; 
McLaren he say was very much dissatisfied at having to go to F l Snelling ; there are much wore posts than that ; he also says that Cuyler has 
been ordered to relieve Wright at West Point, & the latter order to 
Texas, or to some place in the newly acquired Territory, if this is so, I 
shall regret it The vote of Virginia was given to Cass & Butler 
W. relieves T he is a great humbug let him go when & where he may, 
he will suit such men as Houston, Henderson & the other representatives of like qualities in said state I have no doubt that many demo 
crats particularly the bone & sinew in Pennsylvania voted for me, 
otherwise I could not have been elected the fact is the wireworkers could 
not controul them, they were determined to, & did take the matter into 
their own hands & managed it as they thought best 
</p><p>
My troubles & trials have commenced ; every mail which reaches 
here are rilled with applications for office & those connected with me, are 
particularly anxious R. T. Allison wants to be consul at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Havana" rel="city">Havana</a> ; Fred 
Edwards wants to be post master at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a>, to enable Die Hancock, 
& John Gibson to be taken care of, an other distant relative wants the 
post office at St. Louis & others want offices because they are connected 
with some member of my family ; I cannot entertain such applications, 
or in fact any, for was I to do so, I would break myself down in less than 
6 months. I am not going into office for the purpose of proscribing 
people for opinion sake, but to be the president of the country There 
will be no doubt many who will have to go, for good & sufficient causes, 
which I very much regret, & wish there was no necessity for removing any one 
</p><p>
I expect to leave for Washington about the first of Feb? by the way 
of the Mississippi & Ohio, M" Taylor on ace of feeble health will not 
accompany me, she will remain with Dick who will accompany her to 
Washington, or to Cumberland in May or June, where I will join her, 
when he will return to the South ; I do not wish him to locate at or about 
Washington, or to fill any office Betty was married last week to Col 
Bliss ; they are now absent on a visit to Mr & Mrs Taylor at Point 
Coupee, but will return in a few days ; I expect they will go North during 
next month by sea, in one of the steam packets Betty I presume will 
keep Ann advised as to her movements Dick is on the plantation 
Mrs T. whose health is not good joins me in love to An & the young 
ladies & Rob, as well as kindest regards to to the Col & all his family, as 
well as to R. T. Allison if still in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, & wishing you & yours con 
tinued health & prosperity I remain truly 
</p><p>
Your Friend
