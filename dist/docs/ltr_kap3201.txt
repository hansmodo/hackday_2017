SIR, 
</p><p>
In my preceding representations, I have been particular respecting the present state of the cavalry, 
and the means by which it may be augmented and 
completed ; but, on this head, I must necessarily know 
your Excellency's determination. The advantages that 
would arise from a superiority in cavalry are too obvious to be unnoticed. It may be further observed 
that, during this war, the country will daily become 
more open and clear of woods and fens, and consequently better adapted to the manoeuvres and service 
of the cavalry. 
</p><p>
While we are superior in cavalry, the enemy will 
not dare to extend their force, and, notwithstanding 
we act on the defensive, we shall have many opportunities of attacking and destroying the enemy by 
degrees ; whereas, if they have it in their power to 
augment their cavalry, and we suffer ours to diminish 
and dwindle away, it may happen that the loss of a 
battle will terminate in our total defeat. Our army, 
once dispersed and pursued by their horse, will never 
be able to rally. Thus our retreat may early be cut 
off, our baggage lost, our principal officers taken, and 
many other events occur not less fatal. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency must be too much occupied to 
take cognizance of the detail of every department, 
A workman requires proper tools to carry on his 
business, and, if he does not use them in their place, 
he cannot be perfect. Your Excellency is undoubtedly acquainted with yours ; therefore a person, possessing your confidence, and properly authorized, is 
essentially necessary to answer decisively such proposals as I have made in my late representations respecting the cavalry. 
</p><p>
I must not omit to mention, here, the dissatisfaction 
you have expressed at my seeming inattention to 
your orders. Your Excellency may be assured, that 
the good of the service is my constant study, but the 
weak state of the corps I command, renders it impossible to perform every service required ; nay, my reputation is exposed, as, being an entire stranger in 
the country, the least accident would suffice to injure 
me ; but, notwithstanding, I cannot avoid harding 
every thing that is valuable in life.
