Sir, 
</p><p>
I inclose to your Excellency a letter for <a href='/results.php?tla=cdt' rel='colleague'>M. De Ternay</a>, in which you will see what measures I have 
taken to fulfil the intentions, which you imparted to 
me on the 27th instant. I beg you will seal this 
packet, and send it to his address by the first opportunity. 
</p><p>
Congress have put under your orders the frigates, 
in directing them to come into the Delaware. You 
will be able to judge, after your arrangements with 
the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdt' rel='colleague'>Chevalier De Ternay</a>, whether these vessels, or 
one of them, may not accomplish the commission desired Their cruise may then be useful to the commerce of the United States. I know not whether <a href='/results.php?tla=cdt' rel='colleague'>M. De Ternay</a> will communicate to them any signals, by means of wMcli they may approach the coast without 
danger. Your Excellency may be able, should you 
think it necessary, to suggest it to him. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to he, &c.,
