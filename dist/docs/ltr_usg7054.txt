[On the <a rel='day origin' value='6'>6th</a> of <a rel='month origin' value='2'>February</a> [<a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>], General Grant reported from <a href='/results.php?city=nashville' rel='city origin'>Nashville</a>]

MAJOR-GENERAL H. W. HALLECK, 
</p><p>
General-in-Chief: 
</p><p>
I am making every effort to get supplies to Knoxville for the support of a large force large enough to drive <a href='/results.php?tla=jml' rel='colleague adversary met'>Longstreet</a> out. 
The enemy have evidently fallen back with most of their force from General Thomas's front, some going to Mobile. Has there 
been any movement in that direction by our troops ?

U. S. GRANT,

Major- General, Commanding.
