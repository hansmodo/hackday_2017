SIR,
</p><p>
This will be delivered to you by Mr. John Pine, who acted last
campaign as a horse-guide. He is a true friend to the country.
Whenever he shall get properly mounted, and reports himself to you for
service, give him a certificate of the day, and employ him.
</p><p>
Enclosed you have a list of horse-thieves and others who act very
prejudicial to our cause. I wish to have them taken and sent up here.
Perhaps it will be most eligible to make the attempt on all at the
same time. But I do not wish to retard the forage on your left, as
those posts are in great want of that article.
</p><p>
I am, sir, your humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=alm" rel="me">ALEXANDER McDOUGALL</a>.
