The gale of Wednesday night was terrible, making every timber in our old craft quiver and tearing our fore-top staysail to pieces. We had the highest sea that I have seen and I was credibly informed that the waves seldom run higher, but often much more dangerous. The waves appeared like hills moving toward you and threatening to bury you beneath them, but as they came rolling their foamy peaks toward us, our ship mounted over them and then rolled into the hollow they formed, and righted herself to receive the "next customer." We lost twenty miles northing within twenty-four hours, and the vessel was plunging in such a manner that we had to hold on with one hand to keep from rolling over.

The English brig, Vigilant, hove in sight on her homeward passage and bore down upon us. She soon came within hailing distance but the sea being rough and the wind blowing pretty hard, little speaking could be done. We gave each other our longitude by chalking it in large characters on the sides of the vessels. The wind being fair to waft her around the Horn, she was soon lost to view.
</p><p>
A vessel was discovered this morning off our weather bow. We gained on her considerably and this evening she was far astern. All hands are in high glee on account of the fair wind today and rejoice at the prospect of getting out of this tempestous part of the ocean. I wagered to a treat with Mr. Morrow that we would not be in Valparaiso on the 20th inst. We are now being driven northeast by north at the rate of six knots an hour.

The great event of the day is the fresh bread questiona question that I can hardly here explain. Thursday morning orders were given to weigh out about 1 1/2 lbs. of wheat flour and 1 1/2 lbs. of cornmeal to each of us, with the understanding that the upper cabin passengers should be treated in the same way. This latter part of the story some of us did not believe, as false statements had often been made to us before, and therefore we resolved to receive no allowance until the whole contract should be fulfilled. We took this view of it:
</p><p>
The flour appears to be nearly exhausted. While we are put on an allowance of 1 1/2 lbs., others were to be permitted to use as much as they please, and when exhausted we would all have to suffer alike. This would be allowing them to feast at our expense, which by the way fourteen out of twenty-six of us were not quite willing to allow, our motto being to "ask nothing but what is right and submit to nothing that is wrong." Twelve of our party drew their allowance and ordered fresh bread for breakfast. But the rest of us had a cold one, except chocolate or coffee.
</p><p>
We did not expect to have any bread until we reached Valparaiso as we determined not to receive their paltry pound and a half of flour. But this morning we received bread and the question was settled by having it
promised in future upon our giving water to bake it. These parsimonious scoundrels, Messrs. Hathaway & Co., would feed us on worse than almshouse or penitentiary fare. It could hardly be supposed that an American ship could thus be sent out on a long voyage without sufficient and wholesome provisions. They promised potatoes, pickles, etc., but have never furnished us a single pickle nor a solitary vegetable, except a few beans and a little rice. We have had to depend principally upon salt pork and beef. Except for three messes of fresh pork which they furnished while off Cape Horn, the only fresh provisions we have had since leaving Philadelphia, a period of twenty weeks, were a few meals of fish and birds which we caught ourselves, and therefore no thanks to them. These cravens disgrace the American name by thus provisioning an American vessel, and should any of the villains be found in California, where they have promised to be, I should not like to stand responsible for the retributive vengeance that may be visited upon them.

Yesterday I killed and dressed two gonies and had the birds for dinner today. They were first boiled in salt water and then baked in the stove. They furnished a very good meal.
