TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
</p><p>
No. 32 [EDMUND RANDOLPH] 
</p><p>
THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, April 7th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
The Provincial Assembly of Holland have published a law 
requiring the inhabitants to furnish all their plate to be 
coined for public use. 
</p><p>
The plenipotentiaries in France have not yet been admitted by the Convention. It is supposed they meet with 
difficulties which prevent the conclusion of the proposed alliance. The Patriots say that it is only a disagreement 
as to certain articles to be inserted in the treaty. The other party pretend that the alliance has been peremptorily refused. 
</p><p>
A few days since a report was circulated at the same time throughout the province, that peace was concluded between 
France and Prussia, that by one of its articles the French had stipulated that their troops should all be withdrawn from 
this country, that in consequence of this agreement they had 
already begun to quit the frontier, and that as they retired 
they were immediately followed by the Prussians, who would 
very soon be at the gates of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>. It was propagated 
with so much industry and believed with so much credulity, 
that in all the large cities the partizans of the former government began to lay aside the three-colored cockade ; the 
songs peculiar to the party were publicly sung, and the symptoms of seditious practices were so great that it became 
necessary to keep nightly patroles in the streets, and to make examples among the populace of those who had been the 
most conspicuous in instigating the disorders. There can be no doubt that this popular fermentation was purposely 
raised by way of experiment, but by whom does not appear, nor indeed is it easy to discover from which of the parties it was provoked. 
</p><p>
It serves to show the degree of stability usually attributed to the present government, when a mere report, destitute 
of probability no less than of foundation, could produce riotous appearances throughout the province. A judgment may be formed what would be the consequence of the 
French army's withdrawing in reality. 
</p><p>
The destiny of this country may be represented in a very few words, submission to a foreign military or civil war. A 
foreign power may govern very peaceably in the name of either party, but neither has sufficient strength to rule in quiet without external assistance. 
</p><p>
The party now in employ, though probably the most numerous of the two, needs this assistance still more than the 
other because, having no center of union, no constant attractive force drawing them together, they are discordant among 
themselves. They can assimilate only for purposes of hostility against the other party, their common enemy. But 
the moment they become victorious all the jealousies of provinces, of towns, of individuals and families, assume their 
full force, impede every measure proposed, and render their government languid, lifeless and, in the eyes of the people, contemptible. 
</p><p>
The truth of this observation has been proved by the perpetual tenor of this nation's history since its existence as a 
republic. Every occurrence of the present times tends to the same issue. In my letter written before the catastrophe 
of the late government mention was made of the general principles upon which the Patriots then proposed to erect 
their Constitution on the ruins of the Union of Utrecht. At the first moment of the revolution in the transports of 
joy common to all the party, there were some appearances which indicated an united intention to dissolve all the particular corporate privileges and distinctions into the general 
mass by a new Constitution founded upon universal liberty and equality. Hence the acknowledgements of the rights 
of man and citizens proclaimed by all the Assemblies. Hence the original resolutions of the Provincial Assembly 
that the suffrages of that body should in future be counted by persons and not by cities ; hence the forms of popular election observed in constituting the present authorities. 
</p><p>
This unanimity prevailed only during the moment of 
mutual gratulation. The same Assembly which had established the maxim of personal suffrage contrary to the 
practice of the former States of the Province, which had admitted representatives from all the villages unrepresented 
in the States, which had declared the sovereignty to be the right of the whole people and equality to be that of all 
individuals, within a month afterwards decided that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> might send what number of representatives its municipality thought proper, but that only four of them could 
be allowed to vote. The same number of votes is allowed to 
each of the other cities, so that the comparative representation of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> is reduced even lower than it was under the former government. 
</p><p>
The municipality of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> was dissatisfied with this 
decision, but submitted without remonstrating upon the 
presumption that the provisional Assembly would soon be 
dissolved, and that under the new arrangement the capital 
would be entitled to a representation proportionable to its 
population. But soon after the provisional Assembly pre 
scribed an oath of fidelity to themselves, and required it 
should be taken by all the members of the subordinate 
authorities. The municipality of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> refuse to take 
the oath and an open breach ensues between them and 
the provisional Assembly. This circumstance has already 
been related. The arrested members have since been re 
leased, a suspension rather than accommodation of the difference has been mutually consented to. Some concessions 
have been made on both sides, but the oath has not been 
taken, and the parties are not satisfied with each other. The 
root of bitterness is planted and will shoot out in every direction. 
</p><p>
The same spirit of jealousy has already manifested itself 
between the provinces. The total deficiency in the finances, 
general and particular, has been represented, and is equally 
felt by all the members of the Union, but they do not agree 
upon the measures to be taken for filling the public coffers. 
Six of the provinces in the States General have consented to 
the proposal of opening a loan of twelve millions of guilders 
in the name of the Union. But the province of Holland has declared itself very explicitly against this proposition be 
cause the burden of the debt would fall upon that province 
only, and the Provisional Assembly have substituted to 
answer the same purpose the law demanding all the gold 
and silver of the inhabitants with certain exceptions. The 
express condition is, however, annexed to the execution of 
this law that it shall be adopted by the other provinces, which 
will probably not be complied with. The treasuries will still 
remain empty and other resources will be suggested, discussed, and rejected. 
</p><p>
This call for gold and silver is already received very unfavorably within the province. The municipality of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> consider it as bearing with unequal weight upon that 
city ; the regencies of the other cities, consisting generally of persons upon whom this tax will operate more than upon 
the mass of the people, will raise objections against it, and the legislative assembly will again be obliged to hunt for 
expedients. If a suspicion should arise from these observations that the affairs of the country are seen through a prejudiced medium by the writer, the perusal of an address 
from the States General to the several provincial Assemblies will serve to shew how far the facts are demonstrated, and 
how far the opinions are rational. It is contained in the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=leyden" rel="city">Leyden</a> Gazette herewith inclosed. 
</p><p>
The consequence of this internal disunion proceeding from 
many different sources is that the country must be governed 
by a foreign power. The harmony, which has hitherto 
subsisted between the French government and that which 
has arisen under their auspices here, is already less cordial 
than it was in the beginning. But in the supposable case 
of a difference between them the reasons of France will 
necessarily prevail. Under the present circumstances their 
protection is indispensable and must therefore be purchased at any price. The reports still prevail of an armistice 
between France and Prussia. The French army of Sambre and Meuse have withdrawn from Emmerich, and retired 
from the Prussian dominions bordering on this country. The Prussian Army has also quitted the banks of the Rhine 
and marched into Westphalia. The sieges of Luxemburg and Mentz are, at present, the only military operations 
going forward in this quarter, but it is expected the campaign will soon open more extensively, and on the part of 
Great Britain and the Empire it will be pursued, it is said, with the peculiar energy that characterizes the last effort 
for the attainment of a favorite object. 
I am with great respect, &c.
