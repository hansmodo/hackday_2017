MY DEAR SIR,
</p><p>
Your several favours have been handed to me. I have not time now to
answer them fully. It will, however, be done by Major Hull, who is
ordered down to assist you. All your wishes will be gratified. One
hundred and twenty picked men, with bayonets, will reach you
to-morrow. Send your commissary up for rum. Let him call on me.
</p><p>
I am yours,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=alm" rel="me">ALEXANDER McDOUGALL</a>.
