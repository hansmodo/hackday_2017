To my unspeakable surprise, I waked up this 
morning and found myself alive. Once satisfied of 
that, and assuring myself of intense silence in the 
place of the great guns which rocked me to sleep 
about half-past two this morning, I began to doubt 
that I had heard any disturbance in the night, and 
to believe I had written a dream within a dream, 
and that no bombardment had occurred; but all 
corroborate my statement, so it must be true, and 
this portentous silence is only the calm before the 
storm. I am half afraid the land force won't attack. 
We can beat them if they do; but suppose they lay 
siege to Port Hudson and starve us out? That is the 
only way they can conquer.

We hear nothing still that is reliable.

Just before daylight there was a terrific explosion which electrified every one save myself. I was 
sleeping so soundly that I did not hear anything of 
it, though Mrs. Badger says that when she sprang 
up and called me, I talked very rationally about it, 
and asked what it could possibly be. Thought that I 
had ceased talking in my sleep. Miriam was quite 
eloquent in her dreams before the attack, crying 
aloud, "See! See! What do I behold?" as though she 
were witnessing a rehearsal of the scene to follow.

Later. Dr. Kennedy has just passed through, and 
was within the fortifications last night; brings news 
which is perhaps reliable, as it was obtained from Gardiner. It was, as we presumed, the batteries and 
gunboats. One we sunk ; another, the Mississippi, we 
disabled so that the Yankees had to abandon and 
set fire to her, thirty-nine prisoners falling into our 
hands. It was her magazine that exploded this 
morning. Two other boats succeeded in passing, 
though badly crippled. Our batteries fired gallantly. 
Hurrah! for Colonel Steadman! I know his was by 
no means the least efficient!

<a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>, they say, will inevitably be sacked. Alas, for mother and Lilly! What can we do? The whole 
country is at the mercy of the Yankees as long as Gardiner keeps within the fortifications. Six miles 
below here they entered Mr. Newport's, pulled the pillow-cases from the beds, stuffed them with his 
clothes, and helped themselves generally. What can 
we expect here? To tell the truth, I should be disappointed if they did not even look in at us, on their marauding expedition.
