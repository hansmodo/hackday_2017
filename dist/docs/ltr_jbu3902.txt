MY DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I have this moment received information that Major Brewerton was 
to leave Charlestown with a party yesterday, on an expedition to <a href='/results.php?city=santee' rel='city'>Santee</a> 
or <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>. As the General will not be in camp till late in the 
evening, I have despatched an express to communicate the intelligence, 
that you may take the most effectual measures to counteract the designs 
of the enemy. Should there arrive any accounts more minute, I sup 
pose <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> will transmit it as early as possible to you. It is 
probable the success of Major Doyle has induced them to make a second 
attempt to collect rice. Is the rice at Waccamaw much exposed? 
</p><p>
I am, with great respect, dear sir, your most obdt. humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jbu" rel="me">J. BURNET</a>, Aide-de-Camp.
