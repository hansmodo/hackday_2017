My dear sister,
</p><p>
Your welcome letter came safely, but finds our little daughter very ill of jaundice, and she may at any hour take her place among the redeemed in Paradise. Anna is doing well. My intention has & still is to visit you this summer, but I learned a lesson from last summer, not to make a promise for no one can tell what a day will bring forth, but I trust that if our little daughter lives that God will bless us all in a visit to see you & all the family. It seems like a long time since I was at your house. The children I suppose have grown much. Give my thanks to my darling little niece for her letter & tell her I expect to answer it in a few days. Give much love to all the children from myself & Anna. She joins me in love to you.

I received a letter from Wirt this morning stating that he is well but that he has lost his horse by his straying off, and that he wants me to forward him one hundred & five dollars N.Y. funds, which I want to try & do; though it will cost a premium here.

Your affect. Brother
