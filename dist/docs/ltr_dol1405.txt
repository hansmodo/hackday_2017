I have just received yours, dearest <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="sibling met">Anna</a>, and rejoice that you are well and have 
your friends about you. Yesterday we had ninety persons to dine with us at one table, put up on the lawn, under a thick 
arbor. The dinner was profuse and good, and the company very orderly. Many of 
them were old acquaintance of yours, and among them the two Barbours.

We had no ladies except mother Madison, Mrs. Macon, and Nelly Willis ; the 
day was cool and pleasant ; half a dozen only stayed all night with us, and they are 
now about to depart. Colonel Monroe's letter this morning announces the advent 
of the French Minister, and we shall expect him this evening, or perhaps sooner. 
I am less worried here with an hundred visitors than with twenty-five in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>, this summer especially. I wish, 
dearest, you had just such a country home as this. I truly believe it is the happiest 
and most true life, and would be so good for you and the dear children. 
</p><p>
Always your devoted sister,
