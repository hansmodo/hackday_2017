Palo Alto, Calif. <br> Sept 2, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1918">1918</a>. <br><br> Dear Horace: <br> I was so glad to get your interesting letter and only wish I were with you. Today 
is Labor Day and the stores are all closed. As I write these lines it is almost 
four o’clock and I have just returned from San Jose where I witnessed the roll 
call of thirty-two boys drafted to go to Camp Kearney to-morrow morning at seven-thirty. 
Bill Cobb was appointed Captain. I wanted to go with the bunch but as the government 
has closed all enlisting and volunteering I was told I would have to wait my turn. 
However I won’t have to wait long I expect to go before this month is out. Here’s 
hoping I’ll run across you over there. Howard Cobb arrived over there about a 
month ago, you may run across him. I guess you have certainly seen some sights 
in your travels, and the French villages must be very interesting. I understand 
the boys in Co. L who were at Camp Kearney so long are on their way across. Arnaud 
La Pierre, Jake Wattenberger and the bunch that joined the naval reserve are cruising 
around in the old Atlantic over there somewhere. I was talking to your father 
the other day, and believe me he certainly is proud of you. The minute he received 
the card saying you had arrived O.K. he came in to the store and told me. Every 
time I see him he always talks about you. Cooke and Donaldson are always asking 
about you too. Lieutenant Douglas Campbell, America’s first “Ace”, arrived at 
his home in San Jose last week, and people are just going wild over him. He is 
some Hero. The County of Santa Clara presented him with a gold wrist-watch and 
all sorts of entertainments and banquets are being tendered him. I believe he 
is going to be assigned as instructor at one of the Aviation Camps. A new draft 
law has just been passed requiring all men between the ages of 18 and 45 to register, 
Thursday September 12th. It is planned to have four million men in France by next 
summer so that allies can hand the boche the knock-out blow. The boys are certainly 
doing good work over there now, they have Fritz on the run and I think Foch is 
going to keep him on the run. Large captures of prisoners and gains are being 
reported every day now. I don’t know of much more to write, things are about the 
same as ever, outside of the fact I have a bad cold. Dad sends his best wishes 
and so do I from your pal - <br><br> Oscar. P.O. Box 121
