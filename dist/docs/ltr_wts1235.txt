Dear Brother: I am sorry you lost the trip to 
Alaska, but it will give you an excuse for making it at 
some future time. I have never been there, and feel 
little curiosity about it. My judgment at present is that 
we want no more territory. If we could take in the 
territory of Ontario it would make a good State, but the 
vast hyperborean region of the North would embarrass 
us with inchoate States and Territories without a corresponding revenue. I am dead opposed to any more of 
Mexico. All the northern part is desert, like the worst 
parts of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. Further 
south the population is mixed Spanish and Indian, who 
never can be harmonized with our race. Eight millions 
of such people would endanger our institutions. We 
have already enough disturbing influences.

Affectionately yours,
