Is this really Sunday? Never felt less pious, or less seriously disposed! Listen to my story, and 
though I will, of course, fall far short of the actual terror that reigned, yet it will show it in a lukewarm 
light, that can at least recall the excitement to me. 
</p><p>
To begin, then, last evening, about six o clock, as we sat reading, sewing, and making lint in the parlor, we heard a tremendous shell whizzing past, 
which those who watched, said passed not five feet above the house. Of course, there was a slight stir 
among the unsophisticated; though we, who had passed through bombardments, sieges, and alarms 
of all kinds, coolly remarked, "a shell," and kept 
quiet. (The latter class was not very numerous.) 
It was from one of the three Yankee boats that lay 
in the river close by (the Essex and two gunboats), 
which were sweeping teams, provisions, and negroes 
from all the plantations they stopped at from 
<a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> up. The negroes, it is stated, are to 
be armed against us as in town, where all those who 
manned the cannon on Tuesday were, for the most 
part, killed; and served them right! Another shell 
was fired at a carriage containing Mrs. Durald and 
several children, under pretense of discovering if she 
was a guerrilla, doubtless. Fortunately, she was 
not hurt, however. 
</p><p>
By the time the little entente had subsided, deter 
mined to have a frolic, Miss Walters, Ginnie, and I 
got on our horses, and rode off down the Arkansas 
Lane, to have a gallop and a peep at the gunboats 
from the levee. But mother's entreaties prevented 
us from going that near, as she cried that it was 
well known they fired at every horse or vehicle they 
saw in the road, seeing a thousand guerrillas in every 
puff of dust, and we were sure to be killed, murdered, 
and all sorts of bloody deaths awaited us ; so to satisfy her, we took the road about a mile from the 
river, in full view, however. We had not gone very 
far before we met a Mr. Watson, a plain farmer of 
the neighborhood, who begged us to go back. 
"You ll be fired on, ladies, sure! You don't know 
the danger ! Take my advice and go home as quick 
as possible before they shell you ! They shot buggies 
and carriages, and of course they won't mind horses 
with women! Please go home!" But Ginnie, who 
had taken a fancy to go on, acted as spokeswoman, 
and determined to go on in spite of his advice, so, no 
thing loath to follow her example, we thanked him, 
and rode on. Another met us; looked doubtful, said 
it was not so dangerous if the Yankees did not see the 
dust; but if they did, we would be pretty apt to see 
a shell soon after. Here was frolic! So we rode on 
some mile or two beyond, but failing to see anything 
startling, turned back again. 
</p><p>
About two miles from here, we met Mr. Watson 
coming at full speed. The ladies, he said, had sent 
him after us in all haste ; there was a report that the 
whole coast was to be shelled; a lady had passed, 
flying with her children; the carriage was ordered 
out; they were only waiting for us, to run, too. We 
did not believe a word of it, and were indignant at 
their credulity, as well as determined to persuade 
them to remain where they were, if possible. When 
told their plan was to run to the house formerly used 
as a guerrilla camp, we laughed heartily. Suppose 
the Yankees fired a shell into it to discover its in 
habitants? The idea of choosing a spot so well 
known! And what fun in running to a miserable 
hole, when we might sleep comfortably here? I am 
afraid rebellion was in the air. Indeed, an impudent 
little negro, who threw open the gate for us, interrupted Ginnie in the midst of a tirade with a sly 
"Here's the beginning of a little fuss!" 
</p><p>
We found them all crazy with fear. I did not say 
much; I was too provoked to trust myself to argue 
with so many frightened women. I only said I saw 
no necessity. Ginnie resisted ; but finally succumbed. 
Mr. Watson, whom we had enlisted on our side also, 
said it was by no means necessary, but if we were 
determined, we might go to his house, about four 
miles away, and stay there. It was very small, but we 
were welcome. We had in the mean time thrown off 
our riding-skirts, and stood just in our plain dresses, 
though the others were freshly dressed for an exodus. 
Before the man left, the carriage came, though by 
that time we had drawn half the party on our side ; we 
said we would take supper, and decide after, so he 
went off. 
</p><p>
In a few moments a rocket went up from one of the boats, which attracted our attention. Five minutes 
after, we saw a flash directly before us. "See it? Lightning, I expect," said Phillie. *The others all agreed; but I kept quiet, knowing that some, at 
least, knew what it ,was as well as I, and determined not to give the alarm for I was beginning to feel foolish. Before half a minute more came a 
tearing, hissing sound, a sky-rocket whose music I had heard before. Instantly I remembered my running-bag, and flew upstairs to get it, escaping just 
in time from the scene which followed on the gallery which was afterwards most humorously described to me. But I was out of hearing of the screams of 
each (and yet I must have heard them); neither saw Miss Walters tumble against the wall, nor mother turn over her chair, nor the general mtUe 
that followed, in which Mrs. Walters, trying to scale the carriage, was pulled out by Uncle Will, who 
shouted to his plunging horses first, then to the other unreasoning creatures, "Woa, there! T ain't safe! 
Take to the fields ! Take to the woods ! Run to the sugar- house! Take to your heels!" in a frenzy of excitement. 
</p><p>
I escaped all that, and was putting on my hoops and hastily catching up any article that presented 
itself to me in my speed, when the shell burst over the roof, and went rolling down on the gallery, according to the account of those then below. Two 
went far over the house, out of sight. All three were seen by Mr. Watson, who came galloping up in a few moments, crying, "Ladies, for God's sake, leave 
the house!" Then I heard mother calling, "Sarah! You will be killed! Leave your clothes and run!" and a hundred ejaculations that came too fast for 
me to answer except by an occasional Coming, if you will send me a candle ! Candle was the same as though I had demanded a hand-grenade, in mother's 
opinion, for she was sure it would be the signal for a bombardment of my exposed room ; so I tossed down my bundles, swept combs and hairpins into my bosom 
(all points up), and ravished a candle from some one. How quickly I got on, then! I saved the most use less of articles with the greatest zeal, and probably 
left the most serviceable ones. One single dress did my running-bag contain a white linen cambric with a tiny pink flower the one I wore when I told Hal good-bye for the last time. The others I left.

When I got down with my knapsack, mother, Phillie, and Mrs. Walters were -
