Poor Miriam! Poor Sarah! they are disgraced again ! Last night we were all sitting on the balcony 
in the moonlight, singing as usual with our guitar. I have been so accustomed to hear father say in the 
evening, "Come, girls! where is my concert?" and he took so much pleasure in listening, that I could not 
think singing in the balcony was so very dreadful, since he encouraged us in it. But last night changed 
all my ideas. We noticed Federals, both officers and soldiers, pass singly, or by twos or threes at different 
times, but as we were not singing for their benefit, and they were evidently attending to their own affairs, there was no necessity of noticing them at all. 
But about half-past nine, after we had sung two or three dozen others, we commenced "Mary of Argyle." As the last word died away, while the chords 
were still vibrating, came a sound of clapping hands, in short ! Down went every string of the guitar ; 
Charlie cried, "I told you so!" and ordered an immediate retreat; Miriam objected, as undignified, but renounced the guitar; mother sprang to her 
feet, and closed the front windows in an instant, whereupon, dignified or not, we all evacuated the 
gallery and fell back into the house. All this was done in a few minutes, and as quietly as possible ; and while 
the gas was being turned off downstairs, Miriam and I flew upstairs, I confess I was mortified to death, 
very, very much ashamed, but we wanted to see the guilty party, for from below they were in 
visible. We stole out on the front balcony above, and in front of the house that used to be Gibbes's, we beheld one of the culprits. At the sight of the 
creature, my mortification vanished in intense compassion for his. He was standing under the tree, 
half in the moonlight, his hands in his pockets, looking at the extinction of light below, with the true state of affairs dawning on his astonished mind, and 
looking by no means satisfied with himself ! Such an 
abashed creature! He looked just as though he had 
received a kick, that, conscious of deserving, he 
dared not return ! While he yet gazed on the house 
in silent amazement and consternation, hands still 
forlornly searching his pockets, as though for a reason for our behavior, from under the dark shadow 
of the tree another slowly picked himself up from the 
ground hope he was not knocked down by surprise 
and joined the first. His hands sought his pockets, 
too, and, if possible, he looked more mortified than 
the other. After looking for some time at the house, 
satisfied that they had put an end to future singing 
from the gallery, they walked slowly away, turning 
back every now and then to be certain that it was 
a fact. If ever I saw two mortified, hangdog-looking 
men, they were these two as they took their way 
home. Was it not shocking?

But they could not have meant it merely to be 
insulting or they would have placed themselves in 
full view of us, rather than out of sight, under the 
trees. Perhaps they were thinking of their own homes, instead of us.
