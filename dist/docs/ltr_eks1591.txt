We hear nothing here about our movements, but 
are lying under our canvas on the shelly beach of this 
calm sea in a perfect state of monotony. W r e all go 
to bed at tattoo; there is no frolicking and no card 
playing that I know of in the camp. I have almost 
forgotten how to smoke, and certainly shall if we live 
in this way long. The great change of climate and the 
bad brackish water we are compelled to drink has 
made most of our regiment (the Fifth) sick. None of 
the cases are, however, very severe and all are now 
recovering. 1 W T e have had some severe northers since 
I wrote last, accompanied by rain. They are terrible 
visitations to an encampment, sweeping everything 
before them by their violence and with their icy 
breath freezing our very vitals. I slept in a wet bed 
two nights, and only kept alive by having a large 
camp kettle of coals by my side. As soon as the wind 
changes to the south, from which quarter it blows 
almost constantly, the weather becomes as warm as 
with you in midsummer. . . . <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> is 
sending out exploring parties in various directions. 
The last which started for the Rio Grande a few days 
since was compelled to return, by the rains and floods 
which rendered the streams impassable. An expedition has gone by water to examine the harbor of 
Brasos Santiago and the mouth of the Rio Grande. 
All these explorations are to acquire knowledge upon 
which to locate the permanent posts. There is a report 
here this morning of a rupture with the Comanches. 
It is said that some of them have been killed as well 
as two citizens near Bexar, and that the Dragoons are 
in some way mixed up with the affair. These Indians 
are a much more formidable enemy than the Mexicans, 
and if this report be true we may have a stiff fight out 
of them. . . .

December 28. I told you in my last that I was 
going up the Nueces River. Major Sibley, a citizen, 
and myself, with a crew of soldiers, left camp before 
light on Wednesday, December 12. We crossed in 
our boat over <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Corpus Christi" rel="city">Corpus Christi</a> Bay to the mouth of the 
river about eight miles; ascended it eighteen miles 
and encamped. The river Nueces very much resem 
bles the Fox above Lake Winnebago, though there s 
an occasional strip of stunted timber on the bank, 
shutting out from view the boundless prairie beyond. 
The prairies here are never broken by anything resembling the beautiful " oak openings " of the North, 
but in all directions may be seen in the dim distance 
clumps of trees and bushes seldom covering over a 
quarter acre, which are called in the vernacular 
" mots." The deer on these prairies are innumerable, 
large herds of them to be seen in every direction, and 
many persons have said they had seen more than ten 
thousand in one day. From my own observation I 
think they did not exaggerate, for in one day while I 
was up the river, by no means in the best game country, I saw more deer than I supposed existed in all 
America. We were joined at our encampment by 
Merrill, who came riding up to us with a deer hanging 
on each side of his horse. He had crossed the country 
to where we were about eighteen miles from Corpus 
Christi, killing the deer on the way. Merrill, the citizen, and I hunted the next day while the Major 
ascended the river in the boat. The proceeds of our 
hunt were two more deer and twelve turkeys. Next 
day the weather being threatening we returned to 
camp just in time to escape a regular tempest. I was 
much disappointed in the character of the country as 
far as my observation extended. In this region the 
soil is sandy, unproductive, and unfit for agriculture 
but admirably suited for grazing. The short sweet 
muskeet grass is good the whole year, making as fine 
beef as does grain, the cattle always keeping fat upon 
it. The water in the streams is soft and wholesome. 
It was a real treat to us, a regular cold water spree 
after the brackish, filthy water we had been drinking 
on the coast.
