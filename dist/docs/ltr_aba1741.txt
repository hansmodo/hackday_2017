DEAREST OF FRIENDS, 
</p><p>
SHALL I tell my dearest, that tears of joy filled my eyes this morning at the sight of his well-known 
hand? the first line which has blessed my sight, since his four months absence, during which time I 
have never been able to learn a word from him or my dear son, till, about ten days ago, an English 
paper, taken in a prize and brought into Salem, contained an account, under the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> news, of your arrival at the abode of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="met acquaintance">Dr. Franklin</a> ; and, last week, a 
cartel, from Halifax, brought Captain Welch, of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, who informed that he left you well the 11th of March, and that he had letters for me, but destroyed them when he was taken ; and this is all the information I have ever been able to obtain. Our enemies 
have told us the vessel was taken, and named the frigate which took her, and that she was carried into 
Plymouth. I have lived a life of fear and anxiety ever since you left me. Not more than a week after 
your absence, the horrid story of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="met acquaintance">Dr. Franklin</a> s assassination was received from France, and sent by 
Mr. Purveyance, of Baltimore, to Congress and to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. Near two months, before that was contradicted. Then we could not hear a word from the 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, and most people gave her up, as taken or lost. Thus has my mind been agitated like a troubled sea. 
</p><p>
You will easily conceive, how grateful your favor of April 25th, and those of our son, were to me 
and mine ; though I regret your short warning, and the little time you had to write, by which means I 
know not how you fared upon your voyage, what reception you have met with (not even from the la 
dies, though you profess yourself an admirer of them) and a thousand circumstances which I wish 
to know, and which are always particularly interest ing to near connexions, I must request you always 
to be minute, and to write me by every conveyance. Some, perhaps, which may appear unlikely to reach 
me, will be the first to arrive. I own I was mortified at so short a letter, but I quiet my heart with thinking there are many more upon their passage to me. I have written several before this, and some of them very long. 
</p><p>
Now I know you are safe, I wish myself with you. Whenever you entertain such a wish, recollect 
that I would have willingly hazarded all dangers to have been your companion ; but, as that was not 
permitted, you must console me in your absence, by a recital of all your adventures ; though, methinks, I 
would not have them in all respects too similar to those related of your venerable colleague, whose 
Mentor-like appearance, age, and philosophy most certainly lead the politico-scientific ladies of France 
to suppose they are embracing the god of wisdom in a human form ; but I, who own that I never yet 
" wished an angel, whom I loved a man," shall be full as content if those divine honors are omitted. The 
whole heart of my friend is in the bosom of his partner. More than half a score of years have so 
riveted it there, that the fabric which contains it must crumble into dust, ere the particles can be separated. I can hear of the brilliant accomplishments 
of any of my sex with pleasure, and rejoice in that liberality of sentiment which acknowledges them. 
At the same time, I regret the trifling, narrow, contracted education of the females of my own country. I have entertained a superior opinion of the 
accomplishments of the French ladies, ever since I read the letters of Dr. Shebbeare, who professes that 
he had rather take the opinion of an accomplished lady, in matters of polite writing, than the first wits 
of Italy ; and should think himself safer, with her approbation, than with that of a long list of literati ; 
and he gives this reason for it, that women have, in general, more delicate sensations than men ; what 
touches them, is for the most part true in nature, whereas men, warped by education, judge amiss 
from previous prejudice, and, referring all things to the mode of the ancients, condemn that by com<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>on, where no true similitude ought to be expected. 
</p><p>
But, in this country, you need not be told how much female education is neglected, nor how fashionable it has been to ridicule female learning ; 
though I acknowledge it my happiness to be connected with a person of a more generous mind and 
liberal sentiments. I cannot forbear transcribing a few generous sentiments which I lately met with up on this subject. 
</p><p>
" If women," says the writer, " are to be esteemed our enemies, methinks it is an ignoble cowardice, 
thus to disarm them, and not allow them the same weapons we use ourselves ; but, if they deserve the 
title of our friends, t'is an inhuman tyranny to debar them of the privileges of ingenuous education, which 
would also render their friendship so much the more delightful to themselves and us. Nature is seldom 
observed to be niggardly of her choicest gifts to the sex. Their senses are generally as quick as ours ; 
their reason as nervous, their judgment as mature and solid. To these natural perfections add but the 
advantages of acquired learning, what polite and charming creatures would they prove ; whilst their 
external beauty does the office of a crystal to the lamp, not shrouding, but disclosing, their brighter intellects. Nor need we fear to lose our empire over 
them by thus improving their native abilities ; since, where there is most learning, sense, and knowledge, 
there is always observed to be the most modesty and rectitude of manners."
</p><p>
THE morning after I received your very short letter, I determined to devote the day to writing to my 
friend ; but I had only just breakfasted, when I had a visit from Monsieur Riviere, an officer on board 
the Languedoc, who speaks English well, the captain of the Zara, arid six or eight other officers, from 
on board another ship. The first gentleman dined with me, and spent the day, so that I had no opportunity of writing that day. The gentlemen officers 
have made me several visits, and I have dined twice on board, at very elegant entertainments. <a href="/results.php?tla=cde" rel="met acquaintance">Count d Estaing</a> has been exceedingly polite to me. Soon after he arrived here, I received a message from 
him, requesting that I would meet him at Colonel Quincy as it was inconvenient leaving his ship for 
any long time. I waited upon him, and was very politely received. Upon parting, he requested that 
the family would accompany me on board his ship and dine with him the next Thursday, with any 
friends we chose to bring ; and his barge should come for us. We went, according to the invitation, 
and were sumptuously entertained, with every delicacy that this country produces, and the addition of 
every foreign article that could render our feast splendid. Music and dancing for the young folks closed the day. 
</p><p>
The temperance of these gentlemen, the peaceable, quiet disposition both of officers and men, joined 
to many other virtues which they have exhibited during their continuance with us, are sufficient 
to make Europeans, and Americans too, blush at their own degeneracy of manners. Not one officer 
has been seen the least disgised with liquor since their arrival. Most that I have seen, appear to be 
gentlemen of family and education. I have been the more desirous to take notice of them, as I cannot 
help saying, that they have been neglected in the town of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. Generals <a href="/results.php?tla=wih" rel="">Heath</a> and Hancock have 
done their part, but very few, if any, private families have any acquaintance with them. Perhaps I feel 
more anxious to have them distinguished, on account of the near and dear connexions I have among them. 
It would gratify me much, if I had it in my power, to entertain every officer in the fleet. 
</p><p>
In the very few lines I have received from you, not the least mention is made, that you have ever received a line from me. I have not been so parsimonious as my friend, perhaps I am not so prudent ; but I cannot take my pen, with my heart overflow 
ing, and not give utterance to some of the abundance which is in it. Could you, after a thousand 
fears and anxieties, long expectation, and painful suspense, be satisfied with my telling you, that I was 
well, that I wished you were with me, that my daughter sent her duty, that I had ordered some articles for you, which I hoped would arrive, &c. &c.? 
By Heaven, if you could, you have changed hearts with some frozen Laplander, or made a voyage to 
a region that has chilled every drop of your blood ; but I will restrain a pen already, I fear, too rash, nor 
shall it tell you how much I have suffered from this appearance of inattention. 
</p><p>
The articles sent by Captain Tucker have arrived safe, and will be of great service to me. Our money is very little better than blank paper. It takes 
forty dollars to purchase a barrel of cider ; fifty pounds lawful for a hundred of sugar, and fifty dollars for a hundred of flour ; four dollars per day for 
a laborer, and find him, which will amount to four more. You will see, by bills drawn before the date 
of this, that I had taken the method which I was happy in finding you had directed me to. I shall 
draw for the rest as I find my situation requires. No article that can be named, foreign or domestic, 
but what costs more than double in hard money what it once sold for. In one letter I have given you an 
account of our local situation, and of every thing I thought you might wish to know. Four or five sheets 
of paper, written to you by the last mail, were destroyed when the vessel was taken. Duplicates are 
my aversion, though I believe I should set a value upon them, if I were to receive them from a certain friend; a friend who never was deficient in testifying his regard and affection to his
