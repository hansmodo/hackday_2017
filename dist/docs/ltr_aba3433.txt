I write to you, my dear sister, not from the disputed banks of the Potomac, the Susquehanna, or the 
Delaware, but from the peaceful borders of the Hudson ; a situation where the hand of nature has so 
lavishly displayed her beauties, that she has left 
scarcely any thing for her handmaid, art, to perform. 
The house in which we reside is situated upon a 
hill, the avenue to which is interspersed with forest 
trees, under which a shrubbery rather too luxuriant 
and wild has taken shelter, owing to its having been 
deprived by death, some years since, of its original 
proprietor, who kept it in perfect order. In front of 
the house, the noble Hudson rolls his majestic waves, 
bearing upon its bosom innumerable small vessels, 
which are constantly forwarding the rich products of 
the neighbouring soil to the busy hand of a more 
extensive commerce. Beyond the Hudson rises to 
our view the fertile country of the Jerseys, covered 
with a golden harvest, and pouring forth plenty like 
the cornucopia of Ceres. On the right hand, an extensive plain presents us with a view of fields covered with verdure, and pastures full of cattle. On 
the left, the city opens upon us, intercepted only by 
clumps of trees, and some rising ground, which 
serves to heighten the beauty of the scene, by appearing to conceal a part. In the back ground, is a 
large flower-garden, enclosed with a hedge and some 
very handsome trees. On one side of it, a grove of 
pines and oaks fit for contemplation.

" In this path How long soe'er the wanderer roves, each step 
Shall wake fresh beauties ; each last point present 
A different picture, new, and yet the same." 
</p><p>
If my days of fancy and romance were not past, 
I could find here an ample field for indulgence ; yet, 
amidst these delightful scenes of nature, my heart 
pants for the society of my dear relatives and friends 
who are too far removed from me. I wish most 
sincerely to return and pass the recess of Congress 
at my habitation in <a href='/results.php?city=braintree' rel='city'>Braintree</a> ; but the season of 
the year, to which Congress has adjourned, renders 
the attempt impracticable. Although I am not 
the only person who questions their making a Congress again until April, yet the punctuality of <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> to all public business would oblige him 
strictly to adhere to the day of adjournment, however inconvenient it might prove to him. He has 
never been absent from his daily duty in Senate a 
single hour from their first meeting ; and the last 
month's business has pressed so hard, that his health 
appears to require a recess. 
</p><p>
Shall I ask my sister why she has not written me 
a line since I came to this place ? With regard to 
myself, I own I have been cautious of writing. I 
know that I stand in a delicate situation. I am fearful of touching upon political subjects ; yet, perhaps, 
there is no person who feels more interested in them. 
And, upon this occasion, I may congratulate my 
country upon the late judicial appointments, in which 
an assemblage of the greatest talents and abilities 
are united which any country can boast of; gentlemen in whom the public have great confidence, 
and who will prove durable pillars in support of our 
government.

<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='friend met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> is nominated for Secretary of State 
in the room of <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='met acquaintance'>Mr. Jay</a>, who is made Chief Justice. 
Thus have we the fairest prospect of sitting down 
under our own vine in peace, provided the restless 
spirit of certain characters, who foam and fret, is 
permitted only its hour upon the stage, and then shall 
no more be heard of, nor permitted to sow the seeds 
of discord among the real defenders of the faith.

Your affectionate sister,

A. A.
