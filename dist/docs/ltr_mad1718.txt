DEAR SIR, I have received your letter, with the unsealed 
one for Monroe, and have forwarded the latter. Your subsequent one, which I calculate to have been written on the 12th 
instant, came to hand two days ago. I feel for your situation, 
but you must bear it. Every consideration, private as well as 
public, requires a further sacrifice of your longings for the repose of Monticello. You must not make your final exit from 
public life till it will be marked with justifying circumstances 
which all good citizens will respect, and to which your friends 
can appeal. At the present crisis, what would the former think? 
what could the latter say? The real motives, whatever they 
might be, would either not be admitted, or could not be explained; and if they should be viewed as satisfactory at a future 
day, the intermediate effects would not be lessened, and could 
not be compensated. I am anxious to see what reception Genet 
will find in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. I hear that the fiscal party in Alex 
andria was an over-match for those who wished to testify th<3 
American sentiment. George Town, it is said, repaired the 
omission. A public dinner was intended for him at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, but he passed with such rapidity that the compliment miscarried. It would toot be amiss if a knowledge of this would 
in a proper mode get to him. I think it certain that he will be 
misled if he takes either the fashionable cant of the cities, or 
the cold caution of the Government, for the sense of the public; 
and I am equally persuaded that nothing but the habit of implicit respect will save the Executive from blame, if, through 
the mask of neutrality, a secret Anglomany should betray itself. 
I forgot, when I requested your attention to my ploughs, to 
ask the favor of you to pay for them, and to let me know the 
amount of your several advances. 
</p><p>
Yours always and affectionately.
