DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the long and friendly letter 
of the 14th instant, which I have had the pleasure 
of receiving from you. It was, for many reasons, 
grateful to me. I value the esteem of the wise and 
virtuous, and had wished to know the particulars of 
transactions respecting which only vague and unsatis 
factory reports had come to my knowledge. Delicacy 
forbad my breaking the subject to you when here. 
</p><p>
I was sure of your politeness, but not certain of a 
more than usual degree of confidence. The latter has 
now been made manifest, and, permit me to assure 
you, it shall be mutual. 
</p><p>
The impression attempted to be made has not 
taken. It passed without a single remark. Your friends thought it merited nothing but silence and 
neglect. The same reason induced me to take no 
notice of it in my answer. I have perused the several papers with which you favored me. The delicacy, 
candor, and temper diffused through your letter, forma strong contrast to the evasions and design observ 
able in some others. Gratitude ought to have attached a certain gentleman to the friend who raised him. 
A spurious ambition, however, has, it seems, made him your enemy. This is not uncommon. To the 
dishonor of human nature, the history of mankind 
has many pages filled with similar instances ; and we 
have little reason to expect that the annals of the 
present or future times will present us with fewer 
characters of this class. On the contrary, there is 
reason to expect they will multiply in the course of 
this revolution.* 
</p><p>
Seasons of general heat, tumult, and fermentation, 
favor the production and growth of some great virtues, and of many great and little vis. Which will 
predominate, is a question which events not yet produced, nor now to be discerned, can alone determine. 
What parties and factions will arise, to what objects 
be directed, what sacrifices they will require, and who 
will be the victims, are matters beyond the sphere 
of human prevision. New modes of Government, not 
generally understood, nor, in certain instances, approved; want of moderation and information in the 
people ; want of abilities and rectitude in some of 
their rulers; a wide field open for the operations of 
ambitious men, raised from low degrees to high stations, and rendered giddy by elevation and the ex 
tent of their views ; laws dictated by the spirit of 
the times, not the spirit of justice and liberal policy ; 
latitude in principles, as well as commerce; fluctuation in manners and public counsels; suspension of education; indifference to religion and moral obligation, &c., &c., are circumstances that portend evils, 
which much prudence, vigor, and circumspection are 
necessary to prevent or control. 
</p><p>
To me there appears reason to expect a long 
storm, and difficult navigation. Calm repose, and the 
sweets of undisturbed retirement, appear more distant 
than a peace with Britain. It gives me pleasure, 
however, to reflect, that the period is approaching 
when we shall become citizens of a better ordered 
State ; and the spending a few troublesome years of 
our eternity in doing good to this and future generations, is not to be avoided or regretted. Things 
will come right, and these States will be great and 
flourishing. The dissolution of our Governments threw 
us into a political chaos. Time, wisdom, and perseverance will reduce it into form, and give it strength. 
order, and harmony. In this work you are (in the 
style of one of your professions) a master builder ; and 
God grant that you may long continue a free and 
accepted one ! 
</p><p>
Thus, my dear Sir, I have indulged myself in thinking loud in your hearing ; it would be an Hibernicism to say in your sight, though, in one sense, more 
true. It is more than probable that I shall frequently 
do the like. Your letter shall be my apology, and 
the pleasure resulting from converse with those weesteem, my motive. I am, dear Sir, with perfect esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
