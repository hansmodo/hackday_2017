DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived here about noon, when I met your favor of the 25th 
instant. My letter of the 20th, informing you of the enemy's 
fleet having fallen down below <a href='/results.php?city=new windsor' rel='city'>New Windsor</a>, must have reached 
you before this. I have, therefore, only to add, that the enemy 
have demolished Fort Montgomery, and all the other posts in the 
Highlands, and moved down with their whole force towards New 
York ; and to ask how I am to dispose of the troops belonging 
to your department, which you have been so good as to place 
under my direction. As it is probable <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a> may 
think it prudent to make an attempt against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I am 
the more anxious to have your directions in this respect, that I 
may govern myself accordingly. I am, with the highest esteem 
and respect, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gec" rel="me">GEORGE CLINTON</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Your troops had not reached <a href='/results.php?city=new windsor' rel='city'>New Windsor</a> yet. The 
last I heard of them, they were at <a href='/results.php?city=kingston' rel='city'>Kingston</a>, since which, to this 
day, I believe the weather has prevented their moving. 
</p>
