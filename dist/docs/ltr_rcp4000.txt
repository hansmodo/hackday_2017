Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
When I sent you, as a token of my constant remembrance, my melange about the Tunis sheep, I intended to 
have written a letter to accompany it. But it seems that 
nothing must go with a pamphlet but the mere direction, 
under the pains and penalties of sousing the correspondent 
or addressee in all costs of enormous postage. It is really 
true, that now, for nearly six years, I have abandoned wine 
and all stimulants, segars and rich food included. Every 
thing increasing and accelerating the blood is hostile to my 
health, and produces my constitutional malady, an accumulation of blood on the brain. This will, at the appointed 
time, produce my French-leave of all sublunary things. 
Finding that health and rich living were incompatible, I 
took the resolution to abandon old habits, and have sacredly 
kept it. I find myself, without abstemiousness in plain food, 
healthy generally, and, what I think contributes much to 
preserve health, innocently cheerful. I have now and then 
(in winter the worst) attacks of vertigo, which cupping 
or the lancet, timely applied, remove. This, you may 
say, is a history of my secrets. You and I are on a par in 
age and other circumstances, and may trust one another.

Speltz is an excellent and useful grain. You can see an 
account of it in our first volume, p. 260. I have often 
sowed it ; but, unless you are near a shelling-mill, you must 
give it to your horses. I abandoned the culture of it only 
because I had to send it a great distance for this operation. 
There is a great variety. Some produces whiter flour than 
wheat; some as black as rye. Apropos: General Armstrong sent from Paris to me about two quarts of the most 
extraordinary rye I ever beheld. Under my rage for diffusion, I gave away, in all quarters of our State, spoonfuls, 
till I left myself only half a pint, which is now vigorously 
growing. I wrote to him to procure a tierce or hogshead 
for me ; but I suppose my letter miscarried. I shall renew 
my request now he has got back to us. If he can spread 
this rye plentifully through our country, he will do more 
good than all our intercourse with the French Belial has 
done harm. The flour of this rye is like that of wheat, and 
it weighs sixty-four or sixty-live pounds per bushel. All 
our rye has depreciated here. You must make to me some 
grains of allowance for my antithesis about French intercourse ; for this has done more harm than all their rye is 
worth. I find myself with a wry face whenever I think of 
our Gallic prostrations.

Our second volume is nearly finished. 1 have been 
obliged to write too much, to fill up the chasms. It is too 
Herculean a task to keep alive agricultural publications, 
and I shall give up a labour which rolls back on me like 
the stone of Sisyphus. I have just sent the preface to the 
press. You will see that for lack of a more tangible monument to our departed Confucius, I have erected one out of 
my ink-pot, with a goose's feather. You may say, when 
you see it, that any one could tell the feather belonged to a 
goose ; but it will prove the scarcity of agricultural matter 
even for a preface. With all this, I think it will be a good 
publication, and much better than I expected. The great 
desideratum is, to get people to read such books. I have 
published with the memoirs — as the players say. by particular desire — my plaster book, newly vamped. Being 
tormented by excuses to dozens of requests to obtain new 
facts on plaster — the thorough-bass being dread of criticism — I have told a story for the petty critics in the preface 
(pushed for matter) which will probably bring the wasps 
on me, and not procure a single correspondent to satisfy 
my agricultural curiosity. When it is finished I will send 
it to you. I sincerely wish you may pass a better winter 
than you seem to express a hope of experiencing, amd am, 
Most affectionately, yours, 
</p><p>

P.S. Turn Pandora's box bottom upwards, and get hope 
out first. Dr. Logan called on me with a new-invented micrometer, to measure the filaments of wool, whereof he was 
the bearer for our society. The filament sent with the 
instrument was T oYo o parts of an inch in fineness, and no 
doubt selected. My Tunis wool is considerably finer. He 
says they find in England that they have over-manufactured, and the rage is turning to agriculture. There is no 
bullion, and paper has depreciated. He saw store cattle 
that would not sell here for more than 815, sell at fairs for 
£15 sterling in paper. A milch cow and calf, worth here 
$25, sold for £20 sterling. A universal wish to be in 
friendship with us was expressed by all people of all grades 
in society. Lord Wellesley told him that he had in his office 
proofs of an offer from Bonaparte, to divide this country 
with England. He gives me many entertaining pieces of 
information which my paper obliges me to omit.
