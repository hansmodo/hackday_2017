Dear Brother: . . . The coming session of Congress 
is to be an important one, not in a political sense but in 
a business sense. The tariff, commercial relations with 
American States, and differences with Canada are likely 
to occupy a good deal of time, and in all of these I shall 
have to take a part. What is worse, we will have the 
distribution of many offices. Harrison holds on to this 
dangerous power, and is likely to distribute it during his 
entire term. If so, he will not have another. Cleveland 
did the same and lost. A President should, within the 
first few months of his term, fill all the most important 
appointments, and then he may hope to recover from 
the effect before his term closes. But I suppose you are 
not interested in these things, and I begin to regard 
myself as a spectator rather than an actor. It is not at 
all likely that I shall ever seek or accept an office 
again. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours,
