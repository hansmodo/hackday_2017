SIR : Not hearing of any dispatch from you for a long time, I can no longer forbear sending to know your situation, and what has occurred. Every one, 
as well as myself, is vastly anxious to hear how all stands with you. In case you think any thing could be done to aid and forward the enterprise you 
have in hand, please to write it. But I wish to know your situation particularly, with that of the 
enemy, that the whole may be laid before the convention now here. The number and designs of the enemy, as you collect it, might open some prospects 
to us, that might enable us to form some diversion in your favor. The bearer has orders to lose no time, and to return with all possible haste. 
</p><p>
I am sir, Your humble servant.

P.S. Cap Alexander's company is not yet come. 
</p><p>
COL. WOODFORD.
