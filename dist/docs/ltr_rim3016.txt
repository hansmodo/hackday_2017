MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
When last I had the honor to write, I hoped before now to have had it in my power to give you some good news. I then 
had reason to believe the troops well inclined for a coup-de-main. I have since discovered, to my great mortification, that 
three companies of <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a>'s detachment are very averse 
from the measure. There is strong reason to believe their difference of sentiment from the rest of the troops arises from the 
influence of their officers. Captain  , who has incurred <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a>'s displeasure by some misconduct, and thereby 
given room for harsh language, is at the bottom of it, and has 
made some declarations which I think must draw upon him the 
censure of his country, if brought to trial. Captain and Hubbard seem to espouse his quarrel. A Field-Officer is concerned in it, who wishes, I suppose, to have the separate command of those companies, as the above-mentioned Captains have 
made application for that purpose. This dangerous party threatens the ruin of our affairs. I shall at any rate be obliged to 
change my plan of attack, being too weak to put that in execution I had formerly determined on. I am much afraid my 
friend is deeply concerned in this business. I will have an eclaircissement with him on the subject. I will hereafter acquaint you more particularly with this matter. In the mean 
time, I wish you would not mention names, for I know not 
whether the situation of affairs will admit of doing the public 
the justice I could wish. 
</p><p>
Strain every nerve to send a large corps of troops down, the 
instant the Lake is passable. It is of the utmost importance 
we should be possessed of <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a> before succours can arrive ; and 
I must here give it to you as my opinion, and that of several 
sensible men acquainted with this Province, that we are not to 
expect a union with Canada till we have a force in the country sufficient to insure it against any attempt that may be 
made for its recovery. I believe I have mentioned this in my 
last, but I can t help repeating it again. One difficulty occurs 
to me. How are those troops to be paid here? The Continental money will not be received by the inhabitants. I had 
distributed part of it to the troops at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> ; few would receive it. The consequence was, the soldier offered it for less 
than its value, and so it became depreciated. One scheme has 
occurred to me, which I shall communicate by this opportunity 
to Price and our other friends at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. If they can send 
down to the army such articles as soldiers choose to lay out 
their money upon, employing sutlers for that purpose, who will 
receive our paper, the troops may then be paid in Continental 
currency, which will not be depreciated ; the soldier will not 
grumble, as he may be regularly paid ; and, by degrees, the 
inhabitants may acquire confidence in it, seeing our merchants 
take it freely. What hard cash can be mustered might pay 
the contingencies of the army, such as transportation of bag 
gage, &c., and purchase provisions. 
</p><p>
I am amazed no money is yet arrived. The troops arc uneasy, and I shall by and by be at my wits end to furnish the 
army with provisions. I am the more surprised, as I am 
credibly informed cash arrived from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> three weeks since. I have almost exhausted Price, having 
had upwards of five thousand pounds York from him. I must take this opportunity of acknowledging his services. He has 
been a faithful friend to the cause indeed. His advice and 
assistance, upon every occasion, I have been much benefited 
by ; and when I consider that he has been the first mover of 
those measures which have been attended with so many and 
great advantages to the United Colonies, I can t help wishing 
the Congress to give him an ample testimony of their sense 
of his generous and spirited exertions in the cause of freedom. 
</p><p>
Having so early reported to you my determination to return 
home, I take it for granted measures are taken to supply my 
place. Should not anybody arrive shortly for that purpose, I 
must conclude Congress mean to leave the management of affairs in <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a>'s hands ; and therefore, if this business should terminate in a blockade, I shall think myself at 
liberty to return. However, if possible, I shall make an effort 
for the reduction of the town. I will shortly comply with 
several articles of directions, which I have received from you, 
and which I deferred in hopes of complying with them before 
now, in peaceable possession of <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a>. The strange divided 
state of the troops all this campaign has prevented my sending 
returns, having never been able to get one with any tolerable 
exactness. The three discontented companies are within a few 
days of being free from their engagements. I must try every 
means to prevent their departure, and in this matter I am much 
embarrassed. Their officers have offered to stay, provided they 
may join some other corps. This is resentment against Arnold, 
and will hurt him so much, that I don t think I can consent to 
it. I am, dear Sir, with great respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and affectionate, humble servant, 
</p><p>
