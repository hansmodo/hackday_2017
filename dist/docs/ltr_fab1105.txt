I must add a codicil to my letter as the Ship Martha that I send by does not sail until tomorrow.

Yesterday, two of us visited one of the old convents, such a one as you read about. We wandered through the garden and chapel and as far into the sacred enclosure as those holy iron gates would allow us to, but couldn't get a sight of a Nun.

In the evening, hearing that the Emperor was going to be present we took a box at the theatre for six, at three dollars and a half. The theatre is about as large as the Park at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a> and is finished with a parquet and three tiers of boxes, all partitioned off into private boxes. The end, in front of the stage, is all taken up by the Emperor's box and enclosed in curtains. After the overture the curtains were drawn aside and the whole audience arose while the royal pair advanced to the front, bowed and seated themselves in two arm chairs, the background being filled with officers and the Maids of Honor, I suppose.

His Imperial Highness, Dom Pedro the Second, is a fine looking fellow. Stands about six feet two, has a very dignified look for so young a man (he is only twenty two). He was dressed in plain black and white kids and wore
only a star to distinguish him. The Empress is very plain. She was dressed in black with short sleeves and the only thing handsome about her was her fan. She is the daughter of the King of Naples.

As to the rest of the audience it looked rather gay on account of the number of naval and army officers present in full uniform. There were soldiers stationed at every door and a guard drawn up in the street in front and in front of the stage.
</p><p>
The ladies I was disappointed in. I saw but two or three beauties. In every box they had their slaves to take care of the children for the whole family appeared to come and there was about as much squalling as at a baptism in church.
</p><p>
The orchestra was large and played first-rate. The performances were by the Ravel family and a farce afterwards which was very interesting to us on account of the language.

One of our party came very near losing his character. Poor Fonda went ashore with a thin linen coat on. When we came to go up stairs to our box, the man in the passage stopped him. What for we couldn't find out for some time. At last we took the hint. Nothing but black coats would pass. In vain we tried to tell him by signs that Fonda had better coats on board; that he was a gentleman; that we were Americans and didn't know the rules. 'twas no go. We finally found the man from whom we bought the tickets, who could speak some English and he got him in on condition that he would keep in the shady side of the box. Luckily the rest of us were in full dress. One of the Californians came into the pit with a linen coat on and they actually put him out. So you see that it is coats not men here. Poor Fonda won't get over that this voyage.

When the Emperor retired, we distinguished foreigners
retired of course and arrived safely on board with the help of a boat and two darkies, at one o'clock. We expect to sail tomorrow morning.
