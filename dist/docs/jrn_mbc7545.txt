deep winter at last after months of apparently May or June weather. Even the climate, like everything 
else, is upside down. But after that den of dirt and horror, Montgomery Hall, how white the sheets looked, luxurious bed linen once more, delicious fresh cream with my coffee ! I breakfasted in bed.

Dueling was rife in Camden. William M. Shannon challenged Leitner. Rochelle Blair was Shannon's second and 
Artemus Goodwyn was Leitner's. My husband was riding hard all day to stop the foolish people. Mr. Chesnut 
finally arranged the difficulty. There was a court of honor and no duel. Mr. Leitner had struck Mr. Shannon at a 
negro trial. That's the way the row began. Everybody knows of it. We suggested that Judge Withers should arrest the belligerents. Dr. Boykin and Joe Kershaw l aided Mr. Chesnut to put an end to the useless risk of life. 
- John Chesnut is a pretty soft-hearted slave-owner. He had two negroes arrested for selling whisky to his people 
on his plantation, and buying stolen corn from them. The culprits in jail sent for him. He found them (this snowy weather) lying in the cold on a bare floor, and he thought that punishment enough; they having had weeks of it. But they were not satisfied to be allowed to evade justice and slip away. They begged of him (and got) five dollars to buy shoes to run away in. I said : Why, this is flat compounding a felony. And Johnny put his hands in the armholes of his waistcoat and stalked majestically before me, saying, "Woman, what do you know about law ?"

Mrs. Reynolds stopped the carriage one day to tell me Kitty Boykin was to be married to Savage Heyward. He 
has only ten children already. These people take the old Hebrew pride in the number of children they have. This 
is the true colonizing spirit. There is no danger of crowd ing here and inhabitants are wanted. Old Colonel Chesnut said one day : "Wife, you must feel that you have not been useless in your day and generation. You have now twenty-seven great-grandchildren."

Wednesday. I have been mobbed by my own house servants. Some of them are at the plantation, some hired out 
at the Camden hotel, some are at Mulberry. They agreed to come in a body and beg me to stay at home to keep my 
own house once more, " as I ought not to have them scattered and distributed every which way." I had not been 
a month in Camden since 1858. So a house there would be for their benefit solely, not mine. I asked my cook if she 
lacked anything on the plantation at the Hermitage. " Lack anything? " she said, " I lack everything. What 
are corn-meal, bacon, milk, and molasses? Would that be all you wanted? Ain't I been living and eating exactly 
as you does all these years ? When I cook for you, didn't I have some of all ? Dere, now ! Then she doubled herself 
up laughing. They all shouted, " Missis, we is crazy for you to stay home."

Armsted, my butler, said he hated the hotel. Besides, he heard a man there abusing Marster, but Mr. Clyburne 
took it up and made him stop short. Armsted said he wanted Marster to know Mr. Clyburne was his friend and 
would let nobody say a word behind his back against him, etc., etc. Stay in Camden? Not if I can help it. "Festers 
in provincial sloth that's Tennyson's way of putting it.

" We " came down here by rail, as the English say. Such a crowd of Convention men on board. John Manning flew in to beg me to reserve a seat by me for a young 
lady under his charge. " Place aux dames," said my husband politely, and went off to seek a seat somewhere else. 
As soon as we were fairly under way, Governor Manning came back and threw himself cheerily down into the vacant 
place. After arranging his umbrella and overcoat to his satisfaction, he coolly remarked : "I am the young lady. 
He is always the handsomest man alive (now that poor William Taber has been killed in a duel), and he can be 
very agreeable ; that is, when he pleases to be so. He does not always please. He seemed to have made his little 
maneuver principally to warn me of impending danger to my husband's political career. " Every election now will 
be a surprise. New cliques are not formed yet. The old ones are principally bent upon displacing one another." 
</p><p>
"But the Yankees those dreadful Yankees!" "Oh, never mind, we are going to take care of home folks first! 
How will you like to rusticate! --- go back and mind your own business? " " If I only knew 
what that was -- what was my own business."

Our round table consists of the Judge, Langdon Cheves, Trescott, and ourselves. Here are four of the 
cleverest men that we have, but such very different people, as opposite in every characteristic as the four points of 
the compass. Langdon Cheves and my husband have feelings and ideas in common. Mr. Petigru said of the brilliant Trescott: " He is a man without indignation." Trescott and I laugh at everything.

The Judge, from his life as solicitor, and then on the bench, has learned to look for the darkest motives for every 
action. His judgment on men and things is always so harsh, it shocks and repels even his best friends. To-day 
he said: " Your conversation reminds me of a flashy second-rate novel." " How? " " By the quantity of French 
you sprinkle over it. Do you wish to prevent us from understanding you? " No," said Trescott, " we are using 
French against Africa. We know the black waiters are all ears now, and we want to keep what we have to say dark. We can't afford to take them into our confidence, you know. "
</p><p>
This explanation Trescott gave with great rapidity and many gestures toward the men standing behind us. Still 
speaking the French language, his apology was exasperating, so the Judge glared at him, and, in unabated rage, 
turned to talk with Mr. Cheves, who found it hard to keep a calm countenance.

On the Battery with the Rutledges, Captain Hartstein was introduced to me. He has done some heroic things 
brought home some ships and is a man of mark. After ward he sent me a beautiful bouquet, not half so beautiful, 
however, as Mr. Robert Gourdin's, which already occupied 
the place of honor on my center table. What a dear, delightful place is Charleston !

A lady (who shall be nameless because of her story) came to see me to-day. Her husband has been on the Island 
with the troops for months. She has just been down to see him. She meant only to call on him, but he persuaded her 
to stay two days. She carried him some clothes made from his old measure. Now they are a mile too wide. "So 
much for a hard life! " I said. 
</p><p>
" No, no," said she, " they are all jolly down there. He has trained down ; says it is good for him, and he likes 
the life." Then she became confidential, although it was her first visit to me, a perfect stranger. She had taken 
no clothes down there pushed, as she was, in that manner under Achilles's tent. But she managed things; she tied 
her petticoat around her neck for a nightgown.
