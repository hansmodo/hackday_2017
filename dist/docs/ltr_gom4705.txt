Sir, 
</p><p>
I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 7th instant, and pray you to accept and present to the Comite de 
Salut Public my thanks, for the communication of the receipt of Caron de JBeaumarcbais. 
</p><p>
I think it my duty to observe to you, with regard to this subject, that considerable sums have already been 
by the United States for various objects, arms, ammunition, 
and habiliments, which he sent to America during the last war. 
Now there is reason to believe, that a part of these supplies 
were taken from the public magazines of France, and in this 
case it seems right, that he should be accountable for them to 
the French Republic. I have the honor to be, &c.
