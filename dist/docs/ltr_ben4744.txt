DEAR SIR 
</p><p>
You made an Apology to me for not acquaint' me sooner 
with your Marriage. I ought now to make an Apology to 
you for delaying so long the Answer to your Letter. It was 
mislaid or hid among my Papers and much Business put 
it out of my Mind, or prevented my looking for it and writing 
when I thought of it. So this Account between us if you 
please may stand balanced. I assure you it gave me great 
Pleasure to hear you were married, and into a Family of 
Reputation. This I learnt from the Public Papers. The 
Character you give me of your Bride (as it includes every 
Qualification that in the married State conduces to mutual 
Happiness) is an Addition to that Pleasure. Had you consulted me, as a Friend, on the Occasion, Youth on both sides 
I should not have thought any Objection. Indeed, from the 
matches that have fallen under my Observation, I am 
rather inclin'd to think, that early ones stand the best 
Chance for Happiness. The Tempers and habits of young 
People are not yet become so stiff and uncomplying, as 
when more advanced in Life ; they form more easily to each 
other, and hence many Occasions of Disgust are removed. 
And if Youth has less of that Prudence, that is necessary to 
conduct a Family, yet the Parents and elder Friends of young 
married Persons are generally at hand to afford their Advice, 
which amply supplies that Defect; and, by early Marriage, 
Youth is sooner form'd to regular and useful Life; and 
possibly some of those Accidents, Habits or Connections, that 
might have injured either the Constitution, or the Reputation, 
or both, are thereby happily prevented. 
</p><p>
Particular Circumstances of particular Persons may 
possibly sometimes make it prudent to delay entering into 
that State; but in general, when Nature has render'd our 
Bodies fit for it, the Presumption is in Nature's Favour, 
that she has not judg'd amiss in making us desire it. Late 
Marriages are often attended, too, with this further Inconvenience, that there is not the same Chance the parents 
shall live to see their offspring educated. "Late Children" 
says the Spanish Proverb, "are early Orphans" A melancholy Reflection to those, whose Case it may be ! With us 
in America, Marriages are generally in the Morning of 
Life; our Children are therefore educated and settled in 
the World by Noon ; and thus, our Business being done, we 
have an Afternoon and Evening of chearful Leisure to ourselves; such as your Friend at present enjoys. By these 
early Marriages we are blest with more Children; and from 
the Mode among us, founded in Nature, of every Mother 
suckling and nursing her own Child, more of them are raised. 
Thence the swift Progress of Population among us, unparalleled in Europe. 
</p><p>
In fine, I am glad you are married, and congratulate you 
most cordially upon it. You are now more in the way of 
becoming a useful Citizen; and you have escap'd the unnatural State of Celibacy for Life, the Fate of many here, 
who never intended it, but who, having too long postponed the 
Change of their Condition, find at length, that 'tis too late 
to think of it, and so live all their Lives in a Situation that 
greatly lessens a Man's Value. An odd Volume of a Set of 
Books you know is not worth its proportion of the Set, and 
what think you of the Usefulness of an odd Half of a Pair 
of Scissors ? It cannot well cut any thing. It may possibly 
serve to scrape a Trencher. 
</p><p>
Pray make my Compliments and best Wishes acceptable 
to your Spouse. I am old and heavy and grow a little indolent, or I should ere this have presented them in Person. 
I shall make but small Use of the old Man's Privilege, that 
of giving Advice to younger Friends. Treat your Wife 
always with Respect; it will procure Respect to you, not 
from her only but from all that observe it. Never use a 
slighting Expression to her, even in jest, for Slights in Jest, after frequent bandyings, are apt to end in angry earnest. 
Be studious in your Profession, and you will be learned. 
Be industrious and frugal, and you will be rich. Be sober 
and temperate, and you will be healthy. Be in General virtuous, and you will be happy. At least, you will, by 
such Conduct, stand the best Chance for such Consequences. 
I pray God to bless you both; being ever your affectionate 
Friend, B. FRANKLIN.
