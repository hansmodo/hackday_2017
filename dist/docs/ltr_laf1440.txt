<p>
TO M. DE VERGENNES.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=versailles" rel="city">Versailles</a>, February 2d, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1780">1780</a>.
</p><p>
You approved, sir, of my putting down in writing, before conversing
with you upon the subject of the expedition, some of the measures
necessary to be taken in either of the following cases: first, if I
should command the French detachment; and secondly, if I should resume
an American division.
</p><p>
I must begin by observing that this commission is not only a military
and political, but also a social affair: and from the circumstances
under which I am now placed, I assure you, on my honour, that I believe
the first measure would be most favourable to the public service, and
the interest of France as regards her allies.
</p><p>
As I must immediately begin my preparations, I should wish to be
informed of the decision in sufficient time to select some officers of
proper age, experience, and talents, with whom I can become acquainted
before I take charge of the corps; and on this account it is necessary
to arrange matters immediately with the Prince de Montbarrey. Two old
experienced lieutenant-colonels should command the infantry under me:
in distant expeditions, it is necessary that officers should suit each
other, and I am particularly fond of old officers.
</p><p>
In regard to myself, sir, I ask for nothing,--and as during the course
of a war I may hope to acquire rank, you might either give me one of
those commissions of M. de Sartine, which are only of use in America,
or one that would not prevent my seniors from resuming afterwards their
rank, or else letters of service, to enable me simply to command in the
capacity of an American general officer.
</p><p>
There are three methods of concealing the real aim of the expedition:
1st, to set out together for Lorient, under pretence of taking an
island, and operating in Carolina in the autumn;--2nd, to pretend to
send troops to M. de Bouill?; there need be no commander, and I should
have the title of "mar?chal-des-logis;"--3d, for me to set out
immediately with the grenadiers and dragoons for America, and that the
four battalions, commanded by the two ancient officers, should join me
at Rhode Island.
</p><p>
If I should have the command, you may act with perfect security,
because the Americans know me too well to feel the slightest anxiety. I
will bind myself, if it be desired, to ask for neither rank nor titles,
and, to put the ministry quite at their ease, I will even promise to
refuse them should they be offered me.
</p><p>
In the second case, sir, it would be necessary to prevent, beforehand,
in America, the bad effects that the arrival of another commander would
excite: that I am not to lead that detachment is the last idea that
could ever occur in that country; I will say, therefore, that for
myself I prefer having an American division.
</p><p>
I must be in the secret to prepare the various measures, and inform
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>General Washington</a> of the transaction. A secret with which I was not
acquainted would appear very suspicious at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>.
</p><p>
Three merchant frigates and a transport ship would be procured at
Lorient. We have, it is said, an American crew; the fifteen thousand
suits of clothes, and fifteen thousand guns, &c. might be embarked; at
the end of the month it would be necessary to set out for the
continent.
</p><p>
On arriving at a port, I should endeavour to commence my operations
with <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>General Washington</a>; I should take a division in the army, and,
with <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='co-worker'>M. De La Luzerne</a>'s aid, prepare everything for the arrival of the
French. To increase the number of my division,--to serve as an example
to them,--to change the ideas entertained respecting us,--and to shew
in what perfect good intelligence French and Americans may live
together,--I should request to take with me, at once, a battalion of
six hundred grenadiers, three hundred dragoons, and one hundred
hussars.
</p><p>
Two or three officers, whom I should bring back with me, must obtain
the same rank in France which they had in America, and I should say
that I have refused that rank myself from motives which are purely
social. This attention is necessary to flatter the self-love of the
Americans. We may stop at Bermuda on our way, and establish there the
party for liberty.
</p><p>
I shall set out on Wednesday for Nantes, where the clothes are making;
I shall also attend to the selection of the arms; I shall see the
king's regiment at Angers, to form a detachment from it; I shall repair
to Lorient to hasten the arrangement of the frigates, and to see the
battalion of grenadiers; I shall only be here the 20th, and as my
departure must be public, I shall take leave the 25th, in an American
uniform, and if the wind be favourable, I shall sail the 1st of March.
</p><p>
As it is physically impossible that a detachment commanded by a
foreigner should amalgamate together well, I believe it would be
necessary to increase it by a battalion, which would raise the number
to about three thousand six hundred, and the grenadiers would remain
more particularly attached to me during the campaign.
</p><p>
If that little corps be given to an old field-marshal, we should
certainly displease all the American chiefs. <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='co-worker'>Gates</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker'>Sullivan</a>, and <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='co-worker'>Saint Clair</a>, would not like to be under the orders of others, and their
opinion in the council would be opposed to combined expeditions. I
think it necessary, very necessary, to select a brigadier, and name him
field-marshal, which he would look upon as a promotion. The corps must
consider itself as a division of our army; its commander must abjure
all pretensions, think himself an American major-general, and execute,
in all respects, the orders of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>General Washington</a>. The naval commander
may have more power placed in his hands.
</p><p>
Conclusion. 1st, I think it would be best to give me the corps.--2d, If
it be not given to me, I must instantly set out with the powers I
demand. In either case, it is, unfortunately, necessary to reveal to me
the secret, and set me immediately to work.
</p><p>
I shall have the honour, sir, of paying my respects to you during the
procession.
