DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your favour of December 8th and February 
22d, and thank you for the particular accounts you send me 
of affairs on your side the water, which are very agreeable 
to me to read. 
</p><p>
Here public affairs are in great disorder; a strong opposition against the ministry, which, at the same time, is thought 
not to be well united; and daily apprehensions of new 
changes make it extremely difficult to get forward with business. We must use patience. This satisfaction we have, 
that there is scarce a man of weight, in or out of the ministry, 
that has not now a favourable opinion of the proposed change 
of government in the Proprietary colonies; but during the 
present violent heats, occasioned by some conduct of the 
Assemblies of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and which the opposition aggravate highly in order to distress the friends of 
America in the present ministry, nothing so little interesting 
to them as our application can get forward. 
</p><p>
Your messages on the Circuit-Bill are not yet arrived. 
I much want to see them. 
</p><p>
I send you a little essay of an inscription to the memory 
of my departed, amiable young friend, whose loss I deplore 
with you most sincerely. If it has been long coming to your 
hand, I hope that has occasioned your being furnished with 
another and a better. The style is simple and plain, and 
more proper for such things than affected ornamental expression. 
</p><p>
I am looking out for a chariot for you, which I shall send 
you soon as possible. 
</p><p>
With great esteem, I am, dear friend, yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
