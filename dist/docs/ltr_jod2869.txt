How are you all this morning ? Sick, weak, faint, 
in pain, or pretty well recovered ? By this time, you 
are well acquainted with the small pox. Pray, how do you like it ? 
</p><p>
We have no news. It is very hard that half a 
dozen or half a score armies can't supply us with 
news. We have a famine, a perfect dearth of this 
necessary article. I am, at this present writing, perplexed and plagued with two knotty problems in politics. You love to pick a political bone. So I will 
even throw it to you. 
</p><p>
If a confederation should take place, one great question is, how we shall vote. Whether each colony shall 
count one ? or whether each shall have a weight in 
proportion to its number, or wealth, or exports and 
imports, or a compound ratio of all ? Another is, 
whether Congress shall have authority to limit the dimensions of each colony, to prevent those, which 
claim by charter, or proclamation, or commission to 
the south sea, from growing too great and powerful, so as to be dangerous to the rest ? 
</p><p>
Shall I write you a sheet upon each of these questions ? When you are well enough to read, and I can find leisure enough to write, perhaps I may.

Gerry carried with him a canister for you. But he 
is an old bachelor, and what is worse, a politician, 
and what is worse still, a^kind of soldier, so that I sup 
pose he will have so much curiosity to see armies and 
fortifications, and assemblies, that you will lose many 
a fine breakfast at a time when you want them most. 
</p><p>
Tell Betsey that this same Gerry is such another 
as herself, sex cxccptcd. How is my brother and 
friend Cranch ? How is his other self and their little 
selves, and ours ? Don't be in the dumps, above all 
</p><p>
things. I am hard put to it to keep out of them, 
when I look at borne. But I will be gay if I can. 
</p><p>
Adieu.
