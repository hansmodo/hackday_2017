DEAR SIR That I might not be troublesome, is the only reason, which has hitherto prevented me from answering your agreeable favour of the first of August. 
</p><p>
It is greatly to be regretted that any consideration could prevail, with so potent and so flourishing a people, as those of Pennsylvania, to be silent, when the 
liberty of America is thus dangerously invaded; when her sister colonies are generously contending against oppression, and an union of the whole, would, infallibly 
establish the public freedom and security. To what purpose do her merchants toil, and her people labour for wealth, if arbitrary will, uninfluenced by reason, and 
urged by interest, shall reap the harvest of their diligence and industry? I wish her people may not discover, when it is too late, that the blessings of liberty, flow 
not from timid and selfish policy. I do not observe that your Assembly have expressed, even the least dislike to the late duty act, although all England now agrees, its 
principal intention to be, to establish a precedent for American taxation, by the British Parliament. 
</p><p>
Our long expected governor has arrived. His lordship's good sense, affability and politeness, give general pleasure; but, how his political opinions agree with those 
of Virginia, remains to be known. Our late Assembly is dissolved, and writs have been issued for the choice of a new one, to meet, it is said, in May next; at which 
meeting, it is reported, we are to be informed, that his majesty having seen, disapproves of our objections to 
the, late duty acts, and is determined to support the authority, and directs the act of the sixth of his own reign, commonly called the Bill of Rights, to be laid before 
our Assembly. It is supposed, that the silence of the House on this occasion, would be highly acceptable to 
government; but the propriety of being silent, is a question much agitated here. Say the time-serving men, "the Assembly has denied, and the king has asserted 
those rights, the matter ought to rest, not taking the least notice of it/' and this, on a supposition, that the 
principle asserted, will not again be carried into execution. On the other hand, it is contended, that silence in this case must, by all the world, be deemed a tacit 
giving up our rights, and an acknowledgement, that the British Parliament may, at pleasure, tax the unrepresented Americans; that every kind of reason makes it 
probable, that destructive execution would soon follow so dangerous an admission. The facts, it seems, are 
these: on the stamp act being known here, the Assembly asserted their right of exemption from British taxes: since that time, the Parliament, by an act, declare the 
binding force of their legislature over America, in every instance. But this act never having been laid before 
the Assembly by authority, and the stamp act being repealed, the bill of rights passed off unnoticed. However, the world soon saw an intention to avail themselves 
of this declaratory act, by the passage of the ill-judged duty bill. To this act, the Assembly again object, and by petition, entreat his majesty's interposition, for the 
security of their rights, against the principles of that act. Should a new Assembly be told, that these objections were disapproved, that the authority of the British 
Parliament must be supported, and the bill of rights be laid before them, by the highest authority, how would silence in such a case, be construed? The reception ot 
the act, would be registered, but no objection would follow. The poison, unattended by the antidote, may be used for the destruction of the body politic. I confess. 
I cannot go along with those who would derive security from submission. Is it to be supposed, that so sensible a people as the English, would disturb the peace 
of all North America, and endanger their most valuable trade here, for the poor purpose of establishing a principle, they never meant to execute! This, it seems to- 
me, would be sottishness, not wisdom. When opportunity permits, I should be extremely glad to know your sentiments on these important points, for indeed, I am 
never so wedded to any opinion, that I cannot yield to clear and superior reason. 
</p><p>
I am, with very particular esteem, your obedient and humble servant,
