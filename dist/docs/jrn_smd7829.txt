How long, O how long, is it since I have lain down 
in peace, thinking, "This night I will rest in safety " ? 
Certainly not since the fall of Fort Jackson. If left 
to myself, I would not anticipate evil, but would 
quietly await the issue of all these dreadful events ; 
but when I hear men, who certainly should know 
better than I, express their belief that in twenty-four 
hours the town will be laid in ashes, I begin to grow 
uneasy, and think it must be so, since they say it. 
These last few days, since the news arrived of the 
intervention of the English and French, I have alternately risen and fallen from the depth of despair to 
the height of delight and expectation, as the probability of another exodus diminishes, and peace appears more probable. If these men would not 
prophesy the burning of the city, I would be perfectly satisfied. . . .

Well ! I packed up a few articles to satisfy my conscience, since these men insist that another run is 
inevitable, though against my own conviction. I 
am afraid I was partly influenced by my dream last 
night of being shelled out unexpectedly and flying 
without saving an article. It was the same dream I 
had a night or two before we fled so ingloriously 
from <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>, when I dreamed of meeting Will Pinckney suddenly, who greeted me in the most 
extraordinarily affectionate manner, and told me 
that <a href='/results.php?city=vicksburg' rel='city'>Vicksburg</a> had fallen. He said he had been 
chiefly to blame, and the Southerners were so incensed 
at his losing, the Northerners at his defending, that 
both were determined to hang him; he was running 
for his life. He took me to a hill from which I could 
see the Garrison, and the American flag flying over 
it. I looked, and saw we were standing in blood up 
to our knees, while here and there ghastly white 
bones shone above the red surface. Just then, below 
me I saw crowds of people running. "What is it?" 
I asked. "It means that in another instant they will 
commence to shell the town. Save yourself." "But 
Will I must save some clothes, too ! How can I go 
among strangers with a single dress ? I will get some ! 
I cried. He smiled and said, "You will run with 
only what articles you happen to have on." Bang! 
went the first shell, the people rushed by with 
screams, and I awakened to tell Miriam what an 
absurd dream I had had. It happened as Will had 
said, either that same day or the day after; for the 
change of clothes we saved apiece were given to Tiche, who lost sight of us and quietly came home 
when all was over, and the two dirty skirts and old 
cloak mother saved, after carrying them a mile and 
a half, I put in the buggy that took her up ; so I saved 
no thing except the bag that was tied under my hoops. 
Will was right. I saved not even my powder-bag. (Tiche had it in the bundle.) My handkerchief I 
gave mother before we had walked three squares, 
and throughout that long fearfully warm day, riding 
and walking through the fiery sunshine and stifling 
dust, I had neither to cool or comfort me.
