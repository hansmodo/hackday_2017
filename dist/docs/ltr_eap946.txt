Dearest <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>:--I cannot let an opportunity escape
without addressing a few lines to you, and as Mr. Prizer informed me that he was going to write you, it is with pleasure I resume my pen to perform the same operation. I am constantly thinking and wondering where you are and how you are, what you are doing, and if you have plenty to eat and drink. I suppose by this time you have become accustomed to the trials and hardships of a sea voyage and I expect if your life is spared to return, you will never have a desire to repeat it. Your vessel has been spoken once, which was quite a relief to my mind. Your daguerreo-type proves the greatest source to my comfort. It would be impossible for me to tell you how often I have opened it. I hold it most dear of anything this side the ship Europe. I sincerely hope, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>, that you will return before many months laden with gold. But if you should not succeed, do not despair but return to good old West Chester where with industry and economy a living can yet be made.

Father received a letter from Theodore, the first we received since he left Rio Janeiro. He was in San Francisco driving cart at $8.00 a day. But a letter written three days afterward by James Dixon to his wife stated that he had quit carting and gone to roofing at 12 dollars a day. We think it would be better for him to remain there than to go to the mines. James Dixon is digging well at 6 dollars a day and Thornbury is about the same business. The most distressing circumstance that occurred was the loss of one of their party. A rope broke and a young man by the name of Little fell overboard and was drowned. They could hear his cries for help for a full half-hour, but the sea was so rough and everything being lashed fast to double the Horn, it was impossible to save him.

Theodore advises people to keep what they have and stay where they are.

It seems a long time since you left here, and to think you are not near your place of destination yet. Mr. Prizer is very kind to me and calls to see us frequently. I had a very pleasant visit with my sister in the city. I was very anxious to see the Panorama of California but my time was occupied. They say it is true to life. To see the men digging in the gold mines, so eager for gold! If they would labor as hard here, perhaps they would save as much.
</p><p>
I have had a serious time with my arm. I slipped on the steps and sprained the nerve of my elbow and have been obliged to carry my arm in a sling for two weeks. It is much better now and I can use it a great deal.

There has been a Methodist protracted meeting. Mr. Houston was talking to Mr. Prizer and wanted him to go up to the Mourners' bench and just as he was leaving him, Mr. Houston said, “God bless the printers.” I hope He may, particularly one, and that is you.
</p><p>
Mr. Prizer was jesting today. He said he believed he would go to California and I told him if he went, it would seem to me as if my friends had all left me. I hardly know what to do without you. Mr. Prizer and I were at a ball held at the Horticultural Hall on last Wednesday evening. There were about one hundred and sixty guests. I enjoyed myself exceedingly well. There will be three more of the same kind. I wish you were here to enjoy them.
</p><p>
I believe Miss Bradshaw is still in the market. Mr. Prizer is gallanting Miss Cope. Mr. John Hunter is paying great attention to Miss Annie Hatch. She has
moved next door to us, which makes it pleasanter for me.
</p><p>
I send you a beautiful piece of poetry and I hope you will read it and profit by it.
</p><p>
It has been five months and two weeks since you sailed for California. I hope if you get there safely you will soon be tired and return. Nothing more at present. I remain as ever,
</p><p>
Yours,
</p><p>
