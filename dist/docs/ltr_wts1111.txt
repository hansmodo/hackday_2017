Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
I know that some men think this middle course absurd, 
but no people were ever governed by mere abstract principle. All governments are full of anomalies, English, 
French, and our own; but ours is the best because it 
admits of people having their local interests and prejudices, and yet living in one confederacy. I hope you 
will send me your speech, and if national, I will have it 
circulated. 
</p><p>
I see you have reported nearly all the appropriation 
bills early in the session. This has been referred to in 
my presence repeatedly as evidence of your ability and 
attention to business ; so, whether you feel suited to the 
berth or no, it will strengthen your chances in the country. 
</p><p>
Your brother, 
</p><p>
