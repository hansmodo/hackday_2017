  Enclosed find check for two thousand dollars and note to be signed by you and 
  mother. The bank should not charge you anything to cash this as they deal with 
  Chicago Banks. You had better endorse it and turn it over to the owner if that 
  will do. Hope this will be a good deal for you. Let me know how things are getting 
  along. If any thing goes wrong in the future I will ask you to protect my interest 
  before some outsider.<br>
  With best wishes,<br>
