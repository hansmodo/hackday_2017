DEAR SIR : The practise of engrossing all foreign goods & Country produce has gotten to an enormity here, particularly in the latter articles. Corn flour 
and meat are bought up (as I was informed by Col. Aylett) in so much that it is almost impossible to furnish the public demands, in such time as the necessitys 
of the army require. A gentleman here in partnership with Mr. Morris, has speculated very largely in such articles as the army wants. The public agent 
complains he is anticipated. I hope the practise will be effectually stopped, or fatal consequences must ensue. I write to the General that our enlistments 
go on badly, Indeed they are almost stopped. The Georgia Service has hurt it much. The terrors of the smallpox, added to the lies of deserters and the want 
of necessary s, are fatal objections to the continental Service. Perhaps two-thirds of the six new Battalions are enlisted, but in broken quotas scattered far 
and wide, they move slowly. How long will you sit at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> ? I fear you will come away again before the campaign is long begun. I heartily 
pray for your prosperity and welfare, and as the messenger waits I must conclude this scrawl from
