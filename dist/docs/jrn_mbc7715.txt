<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='11'>11th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. Letters from home, including one from my husband's father, now over ninety, written with his own 
hand, and certainly his own mind still. I quote: " Bad times; worse coming. Starvation stares me in the face. 
Neither John's nor James's overseer will sell me any corn." 
Now, what has the government to do with the fact that on all his plantations he made corn enough to last for the 
whole year, and by the end of January his negroes had stolen it all? Poor old man, he has fallen on evil days, 
after a long life of ease and prosperity.

To-day, I read The Blithedale Romance. Blithedale leaves such an unpleasant impression. I like pleasant, 
kindly stories, now that we are so harrowed by real life. Tragedy is for our hours of ease.
