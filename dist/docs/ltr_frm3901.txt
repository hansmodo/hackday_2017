DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Yours of the 8th ultimo came to hand. By the papers just sent me, 
it appears that Capt. Howell had the candles sold to the flag people, on 
purpose to have a plea of seizing her; you will, therefore, order the 
flag to sail immediately, and Capt. Howell and his vessel's crew to be 
detained, as I wrote you yesterday, until I hear from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> or 
the Governor. If Botard should take her at sea, we have nothing to 
do with it. You will put Moore, Broderick and Myers on board the 
flag vessel, to return to Charlestown, with orders not to return within 
our lines. In answer to your last post, I wrote you yesterday; have 
not heard from head-quarters since. A letter from Capt. Pinckney, Cainhoy, says the British horse were crossing to Haddrell's on Saturday, 
but it comes by such a hand that I don t believe it. I shall hear more to-day. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your obedient servant,
