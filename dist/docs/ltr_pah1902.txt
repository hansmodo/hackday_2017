<p>
TO Robert Carter Nicholas
</p><p>

SIR : The affair of the powder is now settled, so as to produce satisfaction to me, and I earnestly wish to the Colony in general. The people here have 
it in charge from the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hanover" rel="city">HANOVER</a> Committee, to tender their services to you as a public officer, for the purpose of escorting the public Treasury to any place 
in this Colony, where the money would be judged more safe than in the City of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>. The reprisal now made by the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hanover" rel="city">HANOVER</a Volunteers, 
though accomplished in a manner least liable to the imputation of violent extremity, may possibly be the cause of future injury to the Treasury. If there 
fore you apprehend the least danger, a sufficient guard is at your service. I beg the return of the bearer may be instant, because the men wish to know their destination. 
</p><p>
With great regard, I am, Sir, your most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=pah" rel="me">PATRICK HENRY, JUNIOR</a>.
