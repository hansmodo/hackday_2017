Sir, 
</p><p>
Dr. Knight, a surgeon I sent with Colonel Crawford, returned the 4th instant to this place. He brings 
an account of the melancholy fate of poor Crawford. 
The day after the main body retreated, the Colonel, 
Doctor, and nine others, were overtaken, about thirty 
miles from the field of action, by a body of Indians, 
to whom they surrendered. They were taken back to Sandusky, where they all, except the Doctor, were 
put to death. The unfortunate Colonel, in particular, was burned and tortured in every manner they could invent. 
</p><p>
The Doctor, after being a spectator of this distressing scene, was sent, under guard of one Indian, to the 
Shawanese Town, where he was told he would share 
the same fate next day; but fortunately found an opportunity of demolishing the fellow, and making his 
escape. The Doctor adds, that a certain Simon Girty, 
who was formerly in our service, and deserted with McKee, and is now said to have a commission in the 
British service, was present at torturing Colonel Crawford, and that he, the Doctor, was informed by an 
Indian, that a British Captain commands at Sandusky; 
that he believes he was present, also, but is not certain; but says that he saw a person there who was 
dressed and who appeared like a British officer. He 
also says the Colonel begged of Girty to shoot him, 
but he paid no regard to the request. A certain Slover has also come in yesterday, who was under sentence at the Shawanese Town. He says a Mr. William 
Harrison, son-in-law to Colonel Crawford, was quartered and burned. Both he and the Doctor say they 
were assured, by sundry Indians they formerly knew, 
that not a single soul should in future escape torture ; 
and gave, as a reason for this conduct, the Moravian 
affair. A number of people inform me, that Colonel Crawford ought to be considered as a Continental officer, and are of opinion retaliation should take place. 
These, however, are such facts as I have been able 
to get. Dr. Knight is a man of undoubted veracity.

Slover was employed as a guide to the party under Colonel 
This account has struck the people of this country 
with a strange mixture of fear and resentment. their 
solicitations for making another excursion are increasing daily, and they are actually beginning to prepare 
for it. I have the honor to he, with perfect respect, 
Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,
