<a rel='month origin' value='10'>October</a> <a rel='day origin' value='1'>1st</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. Mary Cantey Preston's wedding day has come and gone and Mary is Mrs. John Darby now. Maggie 
Howell dressed the bride's hair beautifully, they said, but it was all covered by her veil, which was of blond-lace, and 
the dress tulle and blond-lace, with diamonds and pearls. 
The bride walked up the aisle on her father's arm, Mrs. Preston on Dr. Darby's. I think it was the handsomest wedding 
party I ever saw. John Darby had brought his wedding uniform home with him from England, and it did all honor 
to his perfect figure. I forget the name of his London tailor the best, of course! " Well " said Isabella, " it 
would be hard for any man to live up to those clothes."

And now, to the amazement of us all, Captain Chesnut (Johnny) who knows everything, has rushed into a flirtation with Buck such as never was. He drives her every day, and those wild, runaway, sorrel colts terrify my soul as 
they go tearing, pitching, and darting from side to side of the street. And my lady enjoys it. When he leaves her, he 
kisses her hand, bowing so low to do it unseen that we see it all.

Saturday. The President will be with us here in Columbia next Tuesday, so Colonel McLean brings us word. 
I have begun at once to prepare to receive him in my small 
house. His apartments have been decorated as well as Confederate stringency would permit. The possibilities were 
not great, but I did what I could for our honored chief ; besides I like the man he has been so kind to me, and his wife 
is one of the few to whom I can never be grateful enough for her generous appreciation and attention. 
</p><p>
I went out to the gate to greet the President, who met me most cordially; kissed me, in fact. Custis Lee and 
Governor Lubbock were at his back. 
</p><p>
Immediately after breakfast (the Presidential party arrived a little before daylight) General Chesnut drove 
off with the President's aides, and <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis</a> sat out on our piazza. There was nobody with him but myself. Some 
little boys strolling by called out, " Come here and look; there is a man on Mrs. Chesnut's porch who looks just like 
Jeff Davis on postage-stamps." People began to gather at once on the street. <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis</a> then went in.

Mrs. McCord sent a magnificent bouquet I thought, course, for the President ; but she gave me such a scolding 
afterward. She did not know he was there ; I, in my mistake about the bouquet, thought she knew, and so did not send her word. 
</p><p>
The President was watching me prepare a mint julep for Custis Lee when Colonel McLean came to inform us that 
a great crowd had gathered and that they were coming to ask the President to speak to them at one o clock. An immense crowd it was men, women, and children. The crowd overflowed the house, the President's hand was nearly 
shaken off. I went to the rear, my head intent on the dinner to be prepared for him, with only a Confederate commissariat. But the patriotic public had come to the rescue. I had been gathering what I could of eatables for a month, 
and now I found that nearly everybody in Columbia was sending me whatever they had that they thought nice 
enough for the President's dinner. We had the sixty-year old Madeira from Mulberry, and the beautiful old china, 
etc. Mrs. Preston sent a boned turkey stuffed with truffles, stuffed tomatoes, and stuffed peppers. Each made a dish 
as pretty as it was appetizing. 
</p><p>
A mob of small boys only came to pay their respects to the President. He seemed to know how to meet that odd delegation. 
</p><p>
Then the President's party had to go, and we bade them an affectionate farewell. Custis Lee and I had spent much 
time gossiping on the back porch. While I was concocting dainties for the dessert, he sat on the banister with a cigar 
in his mouth. He spoke very candidly, telling me many a hard truth for the Confederacy, and about the bad time which was at hand.
