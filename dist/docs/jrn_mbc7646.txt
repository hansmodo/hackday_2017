<a rel='month origin' value='6'>June</a> <a rel='day origin' value='12'>12th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. New England's Butler, best known to us as " Beast" Butler, is famous or infamous now. His amazing 
order to his soldiers at New Orleans and comments on it are in everybody's mouth. We hardly expected from Massachusetts behavior to shame a Comanche.

One happy moment has come into Mrs. Preston's life. I watched her face to-day as she read the morning papers. 
Willie's battery is lauded to the skies. Every paper gave him a paragraph of praise.

South Carolina was at <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard's</a> feet after Fort Sumter. Since Shiloh, she has gotten up, and looks askance 
rather when his name is mentioned. And without Price or <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> who takes charge of the Western forces? 
" Can we hold out if England and France hold off? " cries Mem. No, our time has come.

" For shame, faint heart ! Our people are brave, our cause is just ; our spirit and our patient endurance beyond 
reproach." Here came in Mary Cantey's voice: " I may 
not have any logic, any sense. I give it up. My woman's instinct tells me, all the same, that slavery's time has come. 
If we don't end it, they will."

After all this, tried to read Uncle Tom, but could not ; too sickening ; think of a man sending his little son to beat 
a human being tied to a tree. It is as bad as Squeers beating Smike. Flesh and blood revolt ; you must skip that ; it 
is too bad.

Mr. Preston told a story of <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston</a> as a boy. A party of boys at Abingdon were out on a spree, more boys 
than horses; so <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston</a> rode behind John Preston, who is his cousin. While going over the mountains they 
tried to change horses and got behind a servant who was in charge of them all. The servant's horse kicked up, threw 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston</a>, and broke his leg; a bone showed itself. " Hello, boys ! come here and look : the confounded bone 
has come clear through, called out Joe, coolly. 
</p><p>
They had to carry him on their shoulders, relieving guard. As one party grew tired, another took him up. 
They knew he must suffer fearfully, but he never said so. He was as cool and quiet after his hurt as before. He was 
pretty roughly handled, but they could not help it. His father was in a towering rage because his son's leg was to 
be set by a country doctor, and it might be crooked in the process. At Chickahominy, brave but unlucky Joe had 
already eleven wounds.
