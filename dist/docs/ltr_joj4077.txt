Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
A sufficient number of members to form a Congress not 
having arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, I passed on to this place ten 
days ago, to visit my friends. I found your family well, 
and am happy in this opportunity of cultivating their acquaintance. 
</p><p>
Your obliging letter of the 5th August lately came to 
hand. Accept my thanks for it, and for the pamphlets 
enclosed with it. 
</p><p>
The policy of Britain respecting this country is so repugnant to common sense, that I am sometimes tempted to 
think it must be so ; and the old adage of quos Deus, &c, 
always occurs to me when I reflect on the subject. 
</p><p>
The India business never appeared to me a difficult one. 
</p><p>
Do justice, and all is easy. Cease to treat those unhappy 
nations as slaves, and be content to trade with them as with 
other independent kingdoms. On such an event, advantageous though fair treaties might be made with them, and 
you might leave, with their consent, force sufficient in circumscribed limits, to secure the benefit and observance of 
them. Your tribute, indeed, would be at an end, but it 
ought not to have had a beginning ; and I wish it may ever 
prove a curse to those who impose and exact it in any 
country. 
</p><p>
Our affairs are in such a state as, all circumstances considered, might naturally have been expected ; far better 
than many represent them, though not so well as they 
ought to be. 
</p><p>
Congress is convened at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, and I join them tomorrow. In the course of six or eight weeks a judgment may 
be formed of their prevailing sentiments and views. 
</p><p>
It is certain that we are trading at a wild rate ; and it is 
no less true that your people are giving most absurd credits 
to many, who neither have or ought to have any at home. 
This delirium cannot last. Adieu, my dear sir. 
</p><p>
Yours sincerely, 
</p><p>
