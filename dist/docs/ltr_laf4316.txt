My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
Whatever expectations I had conceived of a speedy 
termination to our revolutionary troubles, I still am 
tossed about in the ocean of factions and commotions 
of every kind. For it is my fate to be on each side 
with equal animosity attacked, both by the aristocratic, slavish, parliamentary, clerical, â€” in a word, by all 
enemies to my free and levelling doctrine ; and, on 
the other side, by the Oiieanist factions, antiroyal, 
licentious, and pillaging parties of every kind ; so that 
my personal escape from amidst so many hostile 
bands is rather dubious, although our great and good 
revolution is, thank Heaven, not only insured in 
France, but on the point of visiting other parts of 
the world, provided the restoration of public order is 
soon obtained in this country, where the good people 
have been better taught how to overthrow despotism 
than they can understand how to submit to the law. 
To you, my dear General, the Patriarch and Generalissimo of universal liberty, I shall render exact accounts of the conduct of your Deputy and Aid in 
that great cause.

You will hear that the National Assembly have 
permitted the cultivation of tobacco throughout the 
kingdom, as it was already established in the frontier 
Provinces, to which they have been induced on three 
accounts. First, because they thought a prohibition 
inconsistent with the principles of the bill of rights; 
secondly, because the removal of the -excise barriers 
to the extremity of the empire, made it necessary to 
have a general rule ; thirdly, because the departments 
formerly called Alsace and Flanders, being greatly 
contaminated by a foreign and aristocratic influence, 
there was no doubt of the impending attack of the 
rebel Princes, Conde and Artois, taking place, and 
being countenanced even by the country farming people, had we cut them off from that branch of cultivation all of a sudden. 
</p><p>
But what is greatly exceptionable, is a duty fixed 
on the introduction of American tobacco, with a premium in favor of the French vessels, and a duty 
much too high, although it was lately lessened, on 
American whale oil. But I beg you, and all citizens 
of the United States, not to be discouraged by that 
hasty and ill-combined measure, which I hope, before 
long, to see rectified, in consequence of a report of 
the Diplomatic Committee, including the whole at 
once, and for which my friends and myself have 
kept our arguments. I shall send you the report, 
the debate, and the resolve. Should we obtain an 
easy introduction of American tobacco, no cultivation 
of any importance can take place in France, and it 
will be the better for both countries. 
</p><p>
M. de Ternant has been named Plenipotentiary 
Minister to the United States. I have warmly wished 
for it, because I know his abilities, his love for liberty, 
his early, steady and active attachment to the United 
States, his veneration and love for you. The more I 
have known Ternant, the more I have found him a 
man of great parts, a steady, virtuous, and faithful 
friend. He has deserved a great share in the confidence of the National Assembly; the patriot side, I 
mean. The Eling has a true regard for him. In a 
word, I hope he will, on every account, answer your 
purposes, and serve America as zealously in the diplomatic line, as he did when in the army.

Adieu, my beloved General. My best respects wait 
on Mrs. Washington. Remember me most affectionately to Hamilton, Jefferson, Knox, Jay, and all 
friends. Madame de Lafayette and children beg their 
tender respects being joined to mine for you and the 
family. Most respectfully and tenderly, I am, my 
dear General, 
</p><p>
Your filial friend, 
</p><p>
