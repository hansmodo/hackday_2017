Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your friendly letter has long remained unanswered ; but 
a variety of private, as well as public affairs, constrained 
me to postpone indulging myself in the pleasure I always 
derive from writing to my friends. The recess (if I may 
so call it) of Congress gives their officers too much leisure 
at present ; and there is reason to fear, that the members 
will be as long in convening this year as they were last. 
Business is at a stand for want of an adequate representation. The languor of the States is to be lamented ; many 
inconveniences have already arisen from it, and if continued, 
serious evils will awaken our people. Our affairs, my dear 
sir, are in a delicate situation, and it is much to be wished, 
that the real patriots, throughout the States, would exert 
themselves to render it more sale and respectable. The 
feuds in Massachusetts are rather suspended than extinguished. What events they may ultimately produce, is 
uncertain ; but I should not be surprised if much trouble 
was to result from them. The public creditors will soon 
become importunate, and Congress cannot create the means 
of satisfying them. It is true that order usually succeeds 
confusion ; but it is a high price to pay for order, especially when a little virtue and good sense would procure 
it for us on very reasonable terms. If the best men would 
be prevailed upon to come forward, and take the lead in 
our legislatures as well as in Congress, and would unite 
their endeavours to rescue their country from its present 
condition, our affairs, both at home and abroad, would soon 
wear a more pleasing aspect. It is time for our people to 
distinguish more accurately than they seem to do, between 
liberty and licentiousness. The late revolution would lose 
much of its glory, as well as utility, if our conduct should 
confirm the tory maxim, " That men are incapable of governing themselves."

With real esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
