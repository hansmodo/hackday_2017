[Grant has just finished mustering into State service the ten additional regiments authorized by the Legislature. He then returned to Galena whence he wrote to Washington, May 24, <a href='/results.php?year=1861'>1861</a>, to the adjutant-general, tendering "his services until the close of the war in such capacity as may be offered." He adds, "I would say in view of my present age and length of service, I feel myself competent to command a regiment, if the President in his judgment should see fit to intrust one to me." He never received an answer to this letter; long after, it was found not properly filed. Grant's own comment is, that it was probably barely read by the adjutant-general and certainly could not have been submitted to higher authority.

The day he wrote this letter he returned to Springfield to find that Governor Yates had already appointed him colonel of one of the regiments that he himself had recently mustered into the State service, the 22d Illinois infantry.]

<p>DEAR FATHER:</p>

<p>
I have now been home nearly a week, but return to Springfield to-day. I have tendered my services to the Government and go to-day to make myself useful, if possible, from this until all our National difficulties are ended. During the six days I have been at home I have felt all the time as if a duty were being neglected that was paramount to any other duty I ever owed. I have every reason to be well satisfied with myself for the services already rendered, but to stop now would not do.
</p>

<p>
All here are well. Orvil or Lank will write to you in a day or two and tell you how business matters stand. Write to me at Springfield.
</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>

U.S. GRANT.
