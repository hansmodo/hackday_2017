My dear Laurens, 
</p><p>
Colonel Armand, who was charged with the delivery of many letters to you from the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='co-worker met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, 
imparting to his friends and the ministry of France your mission, unfortunately arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> after you 
had sailed. By him I gave you an account of the revolt of part of the Jersey troops, Arnold's expedition to 
Virginia, Leslie's arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, and such other matters as occurred after your departure. 
</p><p>
Since that period several interesting events have 
happened ; some favorable, others adverse. Among 
the former may be reckoned Morgan's brilliant action 
with Tarleton ; among the latter, the advantages gained 
by Lord Cornwallis over <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>. The official 
accounts of these I enclose to you. Cornwallis, after 
the defeat of Tarleton, destroyed his wagons, and made 
a violent effort to recover his prisoners, but, failing 
therein moved equally light and rapidly against <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>, who, though he had formed a junction with 
Morgan, was obliged to retreat before him into Virginia. Whether from despair of recovering his prisoners, of bringing Greene to a general action, or because he conceived his own situation critical, I do not 
take upon me to determine ; but the fact is, that here commenced Comwallis's retrograde movements, and Greene's advance from the Roanoke to the place of action. 
</p><p>
On the first notice of the storm, which happened 
on the 22d of January, and of its effects, I intimated 
to the French general the possibility and importance 
of improving the opportunity in an attempt upon Arnold. When I received a more certain account of the 
total loss of the Culloden, and the dismasting of the 
Bedford, two seventy-four-gun ships belonging to the 
British fleet in Gardiner's Bay, I immediately put in 
motion, under the command of the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='co-worker met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, as large a part of my small force here, as I 
could with prudence detach, to proceed to the Head 
of Elk, and, with all expedition, made a proposal to 
the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> and the Chevalier Destouches for a cooperation in Virginia with the whole 
of the fleet of our allies and a part of their land force. 
Before my proposition arrived, in consequence of an 
application to him from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, the Chevalier 
Destouches had sent a ship of the line and two or 
three frigates to the Chesapeake Bay, which not only 
retarded the plan I had proposed (by awaiting their 
return), but ultimately defeated the project ; as the enemy in the mean time remasted the Bedford with the 
masts taken out of the Culloden, and, following the 
French fleet, arrived off the Capes of Virginia before 
it ; where a naval combat ensued, glorious for the 
French, who were inferior in ships and guns, but unprofitable for us, who were disappointed of our object. 
</p><p>
The failure of this expedition, which was most flattering in the commencement, is much to be regretted ; 
because a successful blow in that quarter would, in all probability, have given a decisive turn to our affairs 
in all the southern States ; because it has been attended with considerable expense on our part, and much 
inconvenience to the State of Virginia, by the assembling of its militia ; because the world is disappointed 
at not seeing Arnold in gibbets ; and, above all, because we stood in need of something to keep us afloat, 
till the result of your mission is known ; for, be assured, my dear Laurens, day does not follow night more certainly, than it brings with it some additional 
proof of the impracticability of carrying on the war without the aids you were directed to solicit. As an honest and candid man, as a man whose all depends 
on the final and happy termination of the present contest, I assert this, while I give it decisively as my opinion, that, without a foreign loan, our present force, 
which is but the remnant of an army, cannot be kept together this campaign, much less will it be increased and in readiness for another. 
</p><p>
The observations contained in my letter of the fifth of January last are verified every moment ; and, if 
France delays a timely and powerful aid in the critical 
posture of our affairs, it will avail us nothing, should 
she attempt it hereafter. We are at this hour suspended in the balance ; not from choice, but from hard 
and absolute necessity ; and you may rely on it as a 
fact, that we cannot transport the provisions from the 
States in which they are assessed to the army, because we cannot pay the teamsters, who will no longer 
work for certificates. It is equally certain, that our 
troops are approaching fast to nakedness, and that we 
have nothing to clothe them with ; that our hospitals 
are without medicines and our sick without nutriment 
except such as well men eat ; and that all our public 
works are at a stand, and the artificers disbanding. 
But why need I run into detail, when it may be declared in r. word, that we are at the end of our tether, 
and that now or never our deliverance must come. 
While, indeed, how easy would it be to retort the enemy's own game upon them, if it could be made to 
comport with the general plan of the war to keep a 
superior fleet always in these seas, and France would 
put us in a condition to be active by advancing us 
money. The ruin of the enemy's schemes would then 
be certain ; the bold game they are now playing would 
be the means of effecting it ; for they would be reduced to the necessity of concentrating their force at 
capital points, thereby giving up all the advantages 
they have gained in the southern States, or be vulnerable everywhere. 
</p><p>
Such of the Pennsylvania Hue, as had reassembled 
and were recruited, say about one thousand, were ordered, about the middle of February, to join the southern army ; and since the disappointment of our enterprise against Arnold, I have directed the detachment 
under the command of the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='co-worker met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> to 
proceed thither; but how either can march, without 
money or credit, is more than I can tell. With every 
wish for your success, and a safe and speedy return, 
and with every sentiment of esteem and affection, I 
am, dear Sir, &,c.
