SIR: 
</p><p>
Your letters of the 6th and 9th inst., are come safe to hand, but the 
paper containing the consolidation of Maham's corps you have not sent me, which I suppose was omitted by some mistake. I enclose you 
blank commissions. I very much approve of your plan of removing 
the rice from Santee to <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, for <a href='/results.php?tla=all' rel='colleague'>Gen. Leslie</a> has this day given 
official information that he is greatly distressed for want of provisions, 
and that unless I will furnish him, he must come and take it; there 
fore, you must expect another visit from him before he goes. As to 
your proposal to send rice to Charlestown for clothing, that is now rendered unnecessary, as we shall be in possession of it in the course of a 
month or six weeks. The rice, &c., which Mr. Selby has permission 
to send to town, is in payment for clothing furnished the officers of our 
line, and the supernumerary officers; therefore, his vessel ought not to 
be detained. I am much surprised at your mentioning that the time 
of Maharn's men will all expire in a little time. I understood you, the 
last time we conversed on that subjtct, that very few were enlisted for 
one year, but most for two and three years. This circumstance has 
given me much uneasiness; and, to relieve my difficulties, I request 
you would forward me the return of the regiment without delay, that I 
might know what to determine on respecting that regiment. Although 
I am clearly of opinion there ought to be two Majors to a regiment, I 
should wish first to see before I make an appointment, that the state of 
the corps is such as to render the creation of another Major necessary. 
I must first see <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> before I can say anything to you about 
the exchange of prisoners you mention. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
