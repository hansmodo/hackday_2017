DEAR SIR : <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=quincy" rel="city">Quincy</a>, January 5, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1794">1794</a>. 
</p><p>
I must apologize for not having answered before this 
your last letter, but your conjectures with respect to Columbus were not without foundation, and what with politics and 
law, what with public and private discussion, I have scarcely 
had a moment that I could call my own to perform my 
duties to you. Columbus has been attacked in the Chronicle 
by a writer under the signature of Americanus, and defended 
by another subscribing himself Barneveld? Columbus and Barneveld we are told are one and the same person, and 
the discussion is therefore still protracted, though I hope it 
will soon be closed. 
</p><p>
The public here have been sufficiently favorable to Columbus. The applause which from many different quarters 
has been bestowed upon his letters in private conversations 
has been so much superior to their merits, that I dare not 
repeat the observations which have been reported to me 
lest you should suspect the author of vanity beyond the 
limits of common extravagance. In one of the last Centinels 
there is a sonnet to the writer of Columbus which you will 
probably have seen before this reaches you, and by which 
you will perceive that even the Muses have promised him 
the wreath of glory to entwine his brows. On the other 
hand the saturnine genius of the Chronicle has devoted to 
ineffable contempt the "petulance and affected wit of Columbus and Barneveld, most of which (he says) is A SORT of 
literary plagiarism from Junius " ; they are called the "aspirations of family pride" and the "Juvenile author" is 
assured that he will not be rescued from contempt even 
by the "high station of his sire." 
</p><p>
You will not suspect me to be much affected by criticisms 
like this. But there is one symptom calculated above all 
others to congeal every source of future exertion. It is the 
manner with which these publications are received by some 
of my friends, and by many others, who would be clamorous 
enough in praise of the sentiments, if they were not dis 
posed to check the aspirations of the writer. The public is 
a lady having so many admirers, that a favor is not to be 
obtained from her by one of them with impunity. And 
even when the favor desired is nothing more than a simple 
smile of approbation, she cannot grant it without exciting 
all the evil energies of those whose ardor aims at much more familiar caresses. 
</p><p>
Yet I cannot write for the common purposes of ambition. 
I cannot wish to be the rival of any candidate for public office of any kind. My first and certainly at present my only 
object is to run with honor and reputation the career of my 
profession, and whenever I have joined in the public discussion of political questions it has certainly been from 
motives more patriotic than personal. My country is 
entitled to my services however small their value may be, 
and if she will but approve I shall not ask her to reward them. 
</p><p>
The state of our public affairs assumes an appearance not 
only critical but alarming. Yet I cannot think our greatest 
danger to be apprehended from external enemies. They 
may distress us, but we can be ruined only by ourselves. 
We shall soon have no friends on this side heaven, and we 
shall have none but enemies there, unless we heal in some 
measure our internal divisions. To conciliate and unite 
appears to me at the present moment more than ever the 
interest and duty of every American. With respect to 
Genet and his frenzies, the object is in some measure accomplished. But the prime agent to produce this effect 
has been his own folly. I wish that the wisdom of others 
may extend the principle of reconciliation to the other important interests of the country. 
</p><p>
The winter vacation has given me some considerable respite from the forms of attending upon courts ; but our 
Common Pleas commence their session this week, and for 
the future three months my attention will again be directed 
to my own concerns. No man I find can serve two masters, 
and my professional studies have been somewhat neglected 
while I have been perplexing myself with the affairs of the 
nation. The Attorney General l is now at home, so that I 
shall of course be superseded in my official ministration at the sessions. He looks at me with less complacency than 
ever, and is said to be the writer of Americanus. He in 
tends, it is said, to stand as candidate for Governor, and I 
have some curiosity to see how he will manage his card so as 
to keep upon terms with the prophet Samuel and his party. 
Both Jacobins, both Frenchmen, both pretending to be the 
slavish adorers of our sovereign lords the people. It is 
however conjectured by some that Sullivan will crouch and 
accommodate by taking the second station. This would 
certainly be his best policy, and would probably unite a 
strong party in his favor. The oldest head will no doubt 
wear the tiara, but his ambition will perhaps not be con 
tented with a place, which would deprive him of his present 
office, which is doubly lucrative, and perhaps tie up his 
tongue at the bar. . . .
