Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for your friendly letter of the 17th ult., 
and for the sermon and report which accompnnnd it. 
</p><p>
Whether our religion permits Christians to vote for infidel rulers, is a question which merits more consideration 
than it seems yet to have generally received, either from 
the clergy or the laity. It appears to me, that what the 
prophet said to Jehoshaphat about his attachment to Ahab,* 
affords a salutary lesson on another interesting topic.

* " Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord V 
â€” 2 Chron. xix. 2. 
Although the mere expediency of public measures may 
not be a proper subject for the pulpit, yet, in my opinion, it 
is the right and the duty of our pastors to press the ob 
servance of all moral and religious duties, and to animadvert on every course of conduct which may be repugnant 
to them.

The Rev. Mr. Chapin informed me, that the American 
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions had done me 
the honour to elect me one of the members of it, and has 
also been so obliging as to send me copies of their last 
report. Institutions like this are not only to be approved 
and commended, but also to be sustained and assisted. As 
the declining state of my health will not permit me to render any active service, I feared that by retaining a place at 
the board, I should exclude some other person who would 
be more useful. My answer, therefore, to Mr. Chapin 
referred it to the board to do therein as they may judge 
proper.

The amount of the subscriptions exceed what I had supposed, and manifests a spirit which I hope will become more 
universal. 
</p><p>
Permit me to request the favour of you to procure for 
me two complete sets of the Panoplist,* and to put my 
name on the list of subscribers for two of each of the future 
numbers. I purpose to place one set of them in our town 
library : some good may result from it.

Such is your knowledge and information relative to the 
United States and their affairs, that I regret your finding 
it inconvenient to undertake the history you allude to. 
That it will be written at some future day is probable ; but 
when, or how well performed, is uncertain. Time will not 
wait, but will proceed in its usual way to impair memory, 
to diminish and obscure evidence, to introduce doubt, and 
enable error to impose on credulity, and acquire credit from

currency. I presume, therefore, that a history (except as 
to great outlines) is the less to be depended upon, as its date 
is remote from the period of the transactions which it undertakes to narrate. How few have the talents, the patient 
diligence, and the love of truth which history requires. 
</p><p>
The aspect of the times certainly continues portentous. 
To hope for the best and prepare for the worst, is a trite 
but a good maxim ; especially when associated with the 
reflection that He who governs the world can restrain the 
wrath of man as well as the rage of the ocean. It is a 
favourable circumstance, that the delusion which, like an 
epidemic, has prevailed throughout our country, is abating 
in many of the States. Calamities sometimes afford good 
remedies for national distempers.

My retirement has not disappointed me. As to my 
health, a complaint in the liver has for several years been 
impairing it. Medical prescriptions failing to remove it, 
relief could only be sought from palliatives; and among 
these I find temperance, patience, and resignation to be the 
best. 
</p><p>
I am glad, for her sake and for yours, that Mrs. Morse 
enjoys good health. I hope you do also. That you may 
both live to see many happy returns of this day, is very sincerely the wish of
