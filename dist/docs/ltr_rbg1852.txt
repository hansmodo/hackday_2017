TO ANN BOSWELL GRATZ 
</p><p>
It is very long My Dear Ann, since we have written to each other, and I do not think it fair that the non intercourse law should exist between us- I do not like to torment 
my Dear Brother with frequent letters which may trouble him to answer, and yet do so long to hear from or about him 
in these long separations while so many painful scenes are passing between us, that I am sure you will indulge me with 
one of your pleasant kind letters every now & then even if you find you get only a stupid reply- ....

We are very desirous of hearing about our dear Gary- Frank Blair did not come to make his report and as Mrs 
Biddle is in the country I do not expect to see Appo before she goes to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>- I have written to Lizzie to make 
enquiries of Frank for me- 
</p><p>
Today I had the rare treat of a letter from Miriam Cohen through a private opportunity to N. Y. which was forwarded 
to me- her family are well, and in her own sweet way she uttered kind thoughts that made my heart glad- 'tis sad 
times when the natural flow of familiar intercourse is to be either stolen or only accidentally enjoyed- she tells me there 
is not a young man at home in all their large connection- of course they have all gone to fight against us! What have we 
to expect from Congress? ....

This is the hottest day of our season- thermometer 86- none of our family talk of leaving the city this year for 
pleasure- I hope none will be called on for service in the field- what is the position of Jo Shelby 1 in this terrible struggle? 
Missouri seems to be most turbulent- we feel much worried about Gratz Moses- the young Dr 2 is still with Sara in Canada- 
</p><p>
Fare well My dear Ann, give my dearest love to my brother and accept a most affectionate portion from your attached
