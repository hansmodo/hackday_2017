An old gentleman stopped here just now in a 
carriage and asked to see me. Such a sad, sick old 
man ! He said his name was Caldwell, and that passing through East Feliciana, Mrs. Flynn had asked 
him to deliver a message to us. Had we heard from 
our brothers? I told him the message from Mr. Bell. 
He commenced crying. There was one of them, he 
said, who got hurt. I held my breath and looked at 
him. He cried more still, and said yes, it was Gibbes 
- in the hand not dangerous but - - Here I 
thought he meant to tell me worse; perhaps he was 
dead; but I could not speak, so he went on saying 
Lydia and the General had gone on to <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> in 
stantly, and had probably reached there before to 
day. He took so long to tell it, and he cried so, that 
I was alarmed, until I thought perhaps he had lost 
one of his own sons; but I dared not ask him. Just 
then one of the horses fell down with sunstroke, and 
I begged the old gentleman to come in and rest until 
they could raise the horse; but he said no, he must 
go on to the river. He looked so sick that I could 
not help saying he looked too unwell to go beyond, 
and I wished he would come in. But he burst into 
tears, saying, "Yes, my child, I am very, very sick, 
but I must go on." Poor old man, with his snow-white beard!
