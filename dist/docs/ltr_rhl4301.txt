Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have long had a letter prepared for you in answer to your last favor, which I have kept for the 
Honorable Mr. Sitgreaves to be the bearer of, as he 
proposed to visit you on his return to North Carolina; and the more especially as his stay has been 
occasioned by the necessity of seeing the very important ordinance passed for selling the western 
lands, which I wished you to have in its perfected 
state. The principal design of this letter is to introduce to you Mr. Graham and his lady, the justly 
celebrated <a href='/results.php?tla=cam' rel=''>Mrs. Macaulay Graham</a>, whose reputation in 
the learned world, and among the friends to the rights 
of human nature, is very high indeed. Her merit 
as an historian is very great, and places her as an 
author in the foremost rank of writers. I am well 
pleased to find that she, as well as all other judicious 
foreigners, think themselves, when in America, however distant from <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, obliged to pay their 
respects to you. I believe that this has been her 
only motive for going so far south as Virginia. 
</p><p>
We are amused here with an account, that does 
not indeed come officially to us, hut however in such 
a way as to merit attention. It is a plan of the 
Emperor of Germany, which seems calculated to quiet 
his quarrel with Holland, although, perhaps, it may 
not prevent a war in Europe. He is said to have 
made a treaty with the Elector of Bavaria, by which 
he exchanges his Netherland dominions for those of 
Bavaria, and transfers, with the exchange, all his 
rights and claims upon Holland ; reserving Namur 
and Luxemburg, with a district of country around, 
as a douceur to France, for obtaining the consent of 
that Court to the exchange. The Bavarian dominions 
being much more contiguous to the Austrian than 
those of the Netherlands, must greatly increase the 
Emperor's power by a concentration of his force, 
heretofore so much divided as to render the Netherlands of no great aid in case of war. This, however, 
by increasing the Austrian power, must, of course, 
excite greatly the jealousy of Prussia in particular, 
whose King will probably risk a war rather than see 
his rival thus strengthened. Holland, in the mean 
time, will be relieved, by injurious claims being transferred from a strong to a w^eak hand, and the Emperor may find himself brought to a more equal contest by combating one, instead of three powers lately 
combined against him. What may be the issue of 
this new system, time must develop. 
</p><p>
I wish that I may be enabled by Mr. Sitgreaves 
to furnish you with the final sense of Congress upon 
the momentous business of selling the western lands, 
in doing which the first and greatest object seems to 
be the discharging effectually the great weight of 
debt, that the war has created, and which obstructs 
so effectually every arrangement for future security. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the sincerest respect and esteem, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
