SIR, 
</p><p>
I am to acknowledge the receipt of your several favors, to the 27th ultimo. Your letter of that date, 
containing the very agreeable intelligence of the success of the Continental arms under your command, 
was last night delivered to me by your Aid-de-camp, Colonel Baylor, together with the Hessian standard. 
I entertain the most pleasing expectation that our affairs will henceforth assume a better complexion. 
Your account of the behaviour and spirit of the troops, gave the highest satisfaction to Congress; and manifests a disposition which may prove the fore 
runner of future success. 
</p><p>
Considering the unfavorable temper of the men, broken by fatigue and ill fortune, the happy event 
of the expedition appears the more extraordinary. But troops properly inspired, and animated by a just 
confidence in their leader, will often exceed expectation, or the limits of probability. As it is entirely to your wisdom and conduct the United States are 
indebted for the late success of their arms, the pleasure you must naturally feel on the occasion will be pure and unmixed. May you still proceed in the 
same manner to acquire that glory, which, by your disinterested and magnanimous behaviour, you so highly merit. 
</p><p>
I inclose to you a copy of resolves transmitted to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, relative to the Northern Department, and also sundry other resolves relative to your 
own immediate department, which are all the congress have come into since I wrote you last. I have fonvarded to all the States copies of the resolves, 
vesting you with the powers which I had the pleasure of transmitting in my last, accompanied with letters explaining the reasons on which Congress acted in that particular. 
</p><p>
From the inclosed resolve, you will perceive congress have determined, that a horse, properly caparisoned, be presented to your Aid-de-camp, Colonel Baylor, and to recommend it to you to promote him 
to be a Colonel of a regiment of Light Horse. As 
the Congress have been pleased to intrust me with the execution of this resolve, I must beg you will 
do me the favor to give directions to the Quarter 
master, or other proper person, to purchase as hand 
some a horse, for this purpose, as can be found. The 
reason of my making this application, is an information I had received, that some Light Horse were 
taken at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, and are to be publicly sold for 
the benefit of the soldiery. Should this be the case, 
I must further ask the favor of you to give direction. at the same time to purchase one or two for 
my own use. The money shall be immediately remitted, whatever it may be. I should be glad to 
know what kind of horse furniture you think the 
most proper, as I would, by all means, wish to procure the best; but, without your advice and assistance, I am apprehensive I shall not succeed. If the 
horses are to be had, be pleased to order them to 
be sent to me, and every expense shall be paid 
arising thereon. 
</p><p>
This recommendation of Colonel Baylor, I doubt 
not, will meet with your approbation, and that, on 
his return from Virginia, you will give him a commission, with such pay as you shall think suitable 
and adequate. 
</p><p>
Wishing you, very sincerely, the compliments of 
the season, I have the honor to be, with every sentiment of esteem and regard, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President. 
</p><p>
P. S. I shall send you the letter-books by the 
first safe hand. By this opportunity, I send you four 
bundles, containing two hundred commissions ; the rest 
shall immediately follow.
