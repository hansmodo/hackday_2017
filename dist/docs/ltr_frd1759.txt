My DEAR, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ezk" rel="met friend">MRS. KECKLEY</a>: You judge me rightly I am willing to do what I can to place 
the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mtl" rel="met friend">widow</a> of our <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="met">martyr President</a> in the affluent position which her relation to that good man and 
to the country entitles her to. But I doubt the wisdom of getting up a series of lectures for that 
purpose ; that is just the last thing that should be done. Still, if the thing is done, it should be 
done on a grand scale. The best speakers in the country should be secured for the purpose. You should not place me at the head nor at the foot of 
the list, but sandwich me between, for thus out of the way, it would not give color to the idea. I 
am to speak in Newark on Wednesday evening next, and will endeavor to see you on the subject. 
Of course, if it would not be too much to ask, I would gladly see Mrs. Lincoln, if this could be 
done in a quiet way without the reporters getting hold of it, and using it in some way to the preju 
dice of that already much abused lady. As I shall see you soon, there is less reason to write you at length. 
</p><p>
I am, dear madam, 
</p><p>
With high respect, 
</p><p>
Very truly yours, 
</p><p>
