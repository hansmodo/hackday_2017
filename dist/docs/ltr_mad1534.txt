DEAR SIR, My last, dated November 15th, from this place, 
answered yours of May llth, on the subject of your printed 
notes. I have since had opportunities of consulting other 
friends on the plan you propose, who concur in the result of the 
consultations which I transmitted you. Mr. Wythe's idea seems 
to be generally approved; that the copies destined for the University should be dealt out by the discretion of the Professors, 
rather than indiscriminately and at once put into the hands of 
the students, which, other objections apart, would at once exhaust the stock. A vessel from Havre de Grace brought me a 
few days ago two Trunks of Books, but without letter or catalogue attending them. I have forwarded them to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a> 
without examining much into the contents, lest I should miss a 
conveyance which is very precarious at this season, and be deprived of the amusement they promise me for the residue of the winter.

Our Assembly last night closed a session of 97 days, during 
the whole of which, except the first seven, I have shared in the 
confinement. It opened with a very warm struggle for the 
chair between Mr. Harrison and Mr. Tyler, which ended in the 
victory of the former by a majority of six votes. This victory 
was shortly afterwards nearly frustrated by an impeachment 
of his election in the County of Surry. Having failed in his 
native County of Charles City, he abdicated his residence there, 
removed into the County of Surry, where he had an estate, took 
every step which the interval would admit to constitute himself an inhabitant, and was, in consequence, elected a representative. A charge of non-residence was, nevertheless, brought 
against him, decided against him in the committee of privileges 
by the casting vote of the Chairman, and reversed in the House 
by a very small majority. The election of Doctor Lee was attacked on two grounds: 1 st , of non-residence; 2 dly , of holding a 
lucrative office under Congress. On the 1 st he was acquitted; 
on the 2 d , expelled by a large majority.

The revised Code was brought forward prettly early in the 
session. It was first referred to Committee of Courts of Justice, to report such of the bills as were not of a temporary nature, and, on their report, committed to committee of the whole. 
Some difficulties were raised as to the proper mode of proceeding, and some opposition made to the work itself. These, however, being surmounted, and three days in each week appropriated to the task, we went on slowly but successfully, till we 
arrived at the bill concerning crimes and punishments. Here 
the adversaries of the Code exerted their whole force, which, 
being abetted by the impatience of its friends in an advanced 
stage of the session, so far prevailed that the farther prosecution of the work was postponed till the next session. 
</p><p>
The operation of the bills passed is suspended until the beginning of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1787">1787</a>, so that, if the code should be resumed by the 
next Assembly and finished early in the session, the whole system may commence at once. I found it more popular in the 
Assembly than I had formed any idea of, and though it was 
considered by paragraphs, and carried through all the customary forms, it might have been finished at one session with great 
ease, if the time spent on motions to put it off and other dilatory artifices had been employed on its merits. The adversaries were the Speaker, Thruston, and Mercer, who came late in 
the session into a vacancy left by the death of Col. Brent, of 
Stafford, and contributed principally to the mischief. 
</p><p>
The titles in the enclosed list will point out to you such of 
the bills as were adopted from the Revisal. The alterations 
which they underwent are too numerous to be specified, but 
have not materially vitiated the work. The bills passed over 
were either temporary ones, such as, being not essential as parts 
of the system, may be adopted at any time, and were likely to 
impede it at this, or such as have been rendered unnecessary by 
acts passed since the epoch at which the revisal was prepared. 
After the completion of the work at this session was despaired 
of, it was proposed and decided that a few of the bills following 
the bill concerning crimes and punishments should be taken up, 
as of peculiar importance. 
</p><p>
The only one of these which was pursued into an Act is the 
Bill concerning Religious freedom. The steps taken throughout the Country to defeat the General Assessment had produced all the effect that could have been wished. The table 
was loaded with petitions and remonstrances from all parts 
against the interposition of the Legislature in matters of Religion. A general Convention of the Presbyterian church 
prayed expressly that the bill in the revisal might be passed 
into a law, as the best safeguard, short of a Constitutional one, 
for their religious rights. The bill was carried thro' the House 
of Delegates without alteration. The Senate objected to the 
preamble, and sent down a proposed substitution of the 16 th article of the Declaration of Rights. The House of Delegates 
disagreed. The Senate insisted, and asked a Conference. Their 
objections were frivolous indeed. In order to remove them, as 
they were understood by the Managers of the House of Delegates, the preamble was sent up again from the House of Delegates with one or two verbal alterations. As an amendment 
to these the Senate sent down a few others, which, as they did 
not affect the substance, though they somewhat defaced the 
composition, it was thought better to agree to than to run further risks, especially as it was getting late in the Session and 
the House growing thin. The enacting clauses past without a 
single alteration, and I flatter myself have, in this country, extinguished forever the ambitious hope of making laws for the 
human mind.

Nothing has been yet done with North Carolina towards 
opening a Canal through the Dismal. The powers given to 
Commissioners on our part are renewed, and some negociation 
will be brought about if possible. A certain interest in that 
State is suspected of being disinclined to promote the object, 
notwithstanding its manifest importance to the community at 
large. On Potowmac they have been at work some time. On 
this river they have about eighty hands ready to break ground, 
and have engaged a man to plan for them. I fear there is a 
want of skill for the undertaking that threatens a waste of labour and a discouragement to the enterprize. I do not learn 
that any measures have been taken to procure from Europe the 
aid which ought to be purchased at any price, and which might, 
I should suppose, be purchased at a moderate one.

I had an opportunity a few days ago of knowing that Mrs. 
Carr and her family, as well as your little daughter, were well. 
I am apprehensive that some impediments still detain your 
younger nephew from his destination. Peter has been in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">WILLIAMSBURG</a>, and I am told by Mr. Maury that his progress is 
satisfactory. He has read, under him, Horace, some of Cicero's 
orations, Greek testament, ./Esop's fables in Greek, ten books 
of Homer's Iliad, and is now beginning Xenophon, Juvenal, and 
Livy. He has also given some attention to French. 
</p><p>
I have paid Le Maire ten guineas. He will set out in about 
three weeks, I am told, for France. Mr. Jones has promised 
to collect and forward by him all such papers as are in print, 
and will explain the situation of our affairs to you. Among 
them will be the most important acts of the session, and the 
Journal as far as it will be printed.

Mr. William Hays, in sinking a well on the declivity of the 
hill above the proposed seat of the Capitol, and nearly in a line 
from the Capitol to Belvidere, found about seventy feet below 
the surface several large bones, apparently belonging to a fish 
not less than the shark, and, what is more singular, several fragments of potter's ware in the style of the Indians. Before he 
reached these curiosities he passed through about fifty feet of 
soft blue clay. I have not seen the articles, having but just 
heard of them, and been too closely engaged; but have my information from the most unexceptionable witnesses, who have. 
I am told by General Russell, of Washington County, that, in 
sinking a salt well in that County, he fell in with the hip bone 
of the incognitum, the socket of which was about 8 inches diameter. It was very soft in the subterraneous state, but seemed 
to undergo a petrefaction on being exposed to the air.
