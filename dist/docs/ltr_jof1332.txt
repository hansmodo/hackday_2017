SIR: Having, at the request of the President to be informed what took 
place in the cabinet of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Monroe</a> on the subject of the Seminole campaign, laid before him a copy (except the omission of a name) of a letter 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>, which has since been communicated to you, the President has thought it just to permit me to read your answer of the 29th inst. 
to his letter enclosing it. Between you and the President, or between you 
and Mr. Crawford, or between you and the friends of Mr. Crawford, when 
spoken of in general, it is not my design to intervene. There are, however, 
circumstances in your letter, of a personal character, that require to be placed 
in. their true light, in justice to you and to myself. As to the first, you complain that the interposition of the name of the President deprives you of 
important rights: among these is enumerated " the right of being placed 
(by me) in possession of all the facts and circumstances connected with this 
affair." So far as I understand the point on which the President desired 
information, there is, no circumstance or fact within my knowledge that can 
throw any additional light upon it. There is certainly no fact or circumstance within my knowledge, directly or collaterally connected with it, 
that is not at your service. 
</p><p>
If desirable to you, you shall be furnished with a copy of my letter (a 
copy of it is in the President's hands) referred to in Mr. C.'s letter to me, 
and with the name of the gentleman to whom it was written, known also to 
the President. I cannot promise a copy of the letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=savannah" rel="city">Savannah</a>, to 
which my first was an answer, as I am not sure that it is in being; if it is, 
and can be found on my return to Georgia, you can have a copy of it. 
Having thus offered justice, according to your view of it, you will not be 
surprised that I should expect justice in return. Your answer to the President seems to be founded upon the presumption that there is some conspira 
cy secretly at work to do injury to your character, and to destroy your 
political consequence. With this presumption I have no concern; but the 
circumstances under which my name is introduced by you render it proper 
that I should be distinctly informed if this charge of conspiracy against you 
is intended to apply to me. 
</p><p>
In justice to Mr. (X , and for his use, I shall apply to the President for a 
copy of your letter of the 29th instant. If you have any objection, you 
will state it. I shall take it for granted that you acquiesce, unless other 
wise informed. 
</p><p>
I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant,
