Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last was of the seventeenth instant. In mine of the 
sixteenth, I mentioned the revolution of the tenth. I suggested my idea, that the force commanded by M. de Lafayette 
would not be brought to immediate action, and that in such 
case he and his friends had nothing to hope for. He, as you 
will learn, encamped at Sedan, and official accounts of last 
night inform us, that he has taken refuge with the enemy. 
Thus his circle is completed. He has spent his fortune on a 
revolution, and is now crushed by the wheel which he put in 
motion. He lasted longer than I expected. Some other officers tried to influence their troops in favor of the late constitution, but without effect. They are, it seems, yet to learn 
that an officer has never complete possession of his soldiers, 
till rigid discipline has led them by the hand over fields of 
glory, in which he has shared then- danger, and pointed to 
them the path which leads to triumph. 
</p><p>
These scenes are yet remote, but if the combined powers 
cannot succeed in the present plans, they must hereafter take 
place. In the mean time much suspicion, much jealousy, and 
many victims, are all in the natural order of things.

I do not find that the Prince of Brunswick has made those 
rapid movements, which the existent state of things required, 
and he loses much by delay. He probably understands too well 
the business of war, and his high station requires a man in whom 
the accomplished General should be but a secondary talent. 
I cannot for a moment suppose a possibility of beating him with 
the French army, if army it can be called where there is no 
discipline ; but if he will not commit himself a little to fortune, 
it appears to me a very easy matter to wear away the time 
till winter shuts the theatre. We are now far advanced in 
August, and he has at most three months before him.

The day before yesterday, the British Ambassador received 
a despatch from his court, which he immediately transmitted 
to the present minister of Foreign Affairs, and at the same 
time asked for passports. This despatch has not yet been 
communicated to the Assembly, because it runs rather counter to expectations which had been raised, and of course the 
public mind is not duly prepared. The purport of this despatch is, that Britain is determined on a strict neutrality, that 
she means to preserve it, and therefore, as his letters of credence are to the King now dethroned, he had best come 
away. To this is subjoined a hope, that nothing will happen 
to the King or his family, because that would excite the indignation of all Europe. This despatch, turned into plain English, is shortly, that the British court resent what is already 
done, and will make war immediately if the treatment of the 
King be such as to call for, or to justify, measures of extremity. ; 
</p><p>
The different Ambassadors and ministers are all taking their 
flight, and if I stay I shall be alone. I mean however to stay, 
unless circumstances should command me away, because in 
the admitted case that my letters of credence are to the Monarchy, and not to the Republic of France, it becomes a matter 
of indifference whether I remain in this country, or go to England, during the time which may be needful to obtain your orders, or to produce a settlement of affairs here. Going hence, 
however, would look like taking part against the late revolution, 
and I am not only unauthorised in this respect, but I am bound 
to suppose that if the great majority of the nation adhere to 
the new form, the United States will approve thereof; because 
in the first place we have no right to prescribe to this country 
the government they shall adopt, and next because the basis 
of our own constitution is the indefeasible right of the people 
to establish it.

Among those who are leaving Paris, is the Venetian Ambasdor. He w^as furnished with passports from the office of Foreign Affairs , but he was nevertheless stopped at the barrier, 
was conducted to the Hotel de Ville, was there questioned for 
hours, and his carriages examined and searched. This violation of the rights of Ambassadors could not fail, as you may 
suppose, to make an impression. It has been broadly hinted 
to me, that the honor of my country and my own require that 
I should go away. But I am of a different opinion, and rather 
think that those who give such hints are somewhat influenced 
by fear. It is true that the position is not without danger ; but 
I presume, that when the President did me the honor of naming 
me to this embassy, it was not for my personal pleasure or safety, but to promote the interests of my country. These, there 
fore, I shall continue to pursue to the best of my judgment, and 
as to consequences, they are in the hand of God. I have the 
honor to be, with great respect, &c.
