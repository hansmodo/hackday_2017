SIR : I have just received your letter, dated at Salem 
Hospital, the 19th instant, in which you request me to meet 
you, to-day, at Mr. Goodhue's tavern. I am ignorant of 
any business you can have there to transact with me. 
When you have informed me of your design in making
this request, I shall be able to give you a further answer. 
At present, I can only assure you that 
I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
TIMOTHY PICKERING, JR.
