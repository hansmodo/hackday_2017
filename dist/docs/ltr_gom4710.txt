Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yours of the 19th of April has at length reached me. It 
came through the hands of the Comite de Salut Public, and 
was, of course, read by them, which is well. I thank you for 
the information which it contains respecting public affairs ; and 
it affords me much pleasure to reflect, that my successor will 
probably receive from you similar communications, which will 
be highly useful. I have in former letters said so much on 
that subject, that I will add nothing here. 
The history you give of my recall is perfectly satisfactory, 
so far as I am personally concerned. I have never doubted 
an instant, that I should be treated with candor and honor, and 
I have even the confidence, that I shall always be blest with 
the friendship of those holiest men, who administer the government of the United States. 
</p><p>
I have said above, so far as I am personally concerned. It 
may be necessary to explain myself, and I cannot do it better, 
than by making a kind of testamentary request on behalf of 
my successor, should any of the factions or parties, which may 
prevail in this country, solicit his recall, supposing always that 
his conduct be proper in regard to the United States ; I ask 
then for him, under that restriction, the confidence and 
protection of the American government, to the end that it may 
be known and felt here. I hope a thorough conviction may 
be made to exist, that he is unmovable. T put out of question an extravagant conduct like that of M. Genet, for I am 
sure that he will not sin on that side of the line, and I hope will 
not err on the other. Whenever a stable government shall be 
established in France, it will be certainly right to have here a 
man agreeable to that government, ; and I think a coincidence 
of mutual interests will render the place of such a man easy 
and pleasant. Until that period, pardon me, my dear Sir, 
for saying, that I think a firm and decisive tone and conduct 
will best preserve the peace, as well as the dignity, of our 
country. Switzerland will not be insulted, and yet there is 
no extended waste of waters to separate her from France. 
</p><p>
I will not communicate my sentiments of public affairs, 
because I cherish the hope of doing it in person, and have 
written this letter to provide against the untoward events to 
which maritime affairs are subjected. I am, &c.
