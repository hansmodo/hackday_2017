MY DEAR MADAM, 
</p><p>
For your kind congratulations upon my arrival in 
Europe, receive my thanks. Those only, who have 
crossed the ocean, can realize the pleasure which is 
felt at the sight of land. The inexperienced traveller is more sensible of this, than those who frequently traverse the ocean. I could scarcely realize that 
thirty days had removed me so far distant from my 
native shore ; but the new objects which surrounded 
me did not efface from my remembrance the dearer 
ones which I left behind me. " And is this the country, and are these the people, who so lately waged a cruel war ag-ainst us ?" were reflections, which did 
not escape me amidst all the beauty and grandeur, 
which presented themselves to my eyes, lou have 
doubtless heard from my friends, that I was pleased 
with England, and that I met with much civility and 
politeness there, and a large share of it from your 
connexions. 
</p><p>
I am now resident in a country, to which many 
Americans give the preference. The climate is said 
to be more temperate and mild. I can pass no 
judgment by comparison, but that there are more 
fogs in both, than are agreeable to me. A NorthAmerican, however, has no right to complain of the 
rigor of a climate, which, in the middle of January, 
is as mild as our May ; though I think the fall of 
the year was near as cold as ours. 
</p><p>
Do you know, my dear Madam, what a task you 
have set me ? a description of ladies ! 
</p><p>
11 Catch, ere she change, the Cynthia of this minute." 
</p><p>
To a lady of Mrs. Storer's discernment, the mere 
superficial adorning of the sex would afford but little 
satisfaction. Yet this is all I shall be able to recount 
to her. A stranger in the country, not only to the 
people but to the language, I cannot judge of mental accomplishment, unless you will allow that dress 
and appearance are the index of the mind. The 
etiquette of this country requires the first visit from 
the stranger. You will easily suppose, that I have 
not been very fond of so awkward a situation as 
going to visit ladies, merely to make my dumb compliments, and receive them in return. I have declined visiting several personages, to whom <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> 
would have introduced me, upon this account. An 
acquaintance with a gentleman by no means insures to you a knowledge of his lady ; for no one 
will be so ill-bred as to suppose an intercourse between them. It is from my observations of the 
French ladies at the theatres and public walks, that 
my chief knowledge of them is derived. 
</p><p>
The dress of the French ladies is, like their manners, light, airy, and genteel. They are easy in 
their deportment, eloquent in their speech, their 
voices soft and musical, and their attitude pleasing. 
Habituated to frequent the theatres from their earliest age, they become perfect mistresses of the art 
of insinuation and the powers of persuasion. Intelligence is communicated to every feature of the 
face, and to every limb of the body ; so that it may 
with truth be said, every man of this nation is an 
actor, and every woman an actress. It is not only 
among the rich and polite, who attend the great 
theatres, that this art is acquired, but there are a 
dozen small theatres, to which all classes resort. 
There are frequently given pieces at the opera, and 
at the small theatres, where the actors speak not a 
single word, but where the action alone will delineate to you the story. I was at one of this kind last 
evening. The story is too long to relate here ; but 
there was a terrible sea-storm in it ; the rolling of 
the sea, the mounting of the vessel upon the waves, 
in which I could discern a lady and little child in the 
utmost distress, the terrible claps of thunder and 
flashes of lightning, which flew from one side of the 
stage to the other, really worked me up to such a 
pitch, that I trembled with terror. The vessel was 
finally dashed upon the rocks, and the lady and 
child were cast 'on a desert island. 
</p><p>
The dancing on the stage is a great amusement 
to me, and the dresses are beautifully fanciful. The 
fashionable shape of the ladies here is, to be very 
small at the bottom of the waist, and very large 
round the shoulders, a wasp's, pardon me, ladies, that I should make such a comparison, it is 
only in shape, that I mean to resemble you to them. 
You and I, Madam, must despair of being in the 
mode. 
</p><p>
I enclose to you the pattern of a stomacher, cape, 
and forebody of a gown ; different petticoats are 
much worn, and then the stomacher must be of the 
petticoat color, and the cape of the gown, as well as 
the sleeves. Sometimes a false sleeve is made use 
of to draw over the other, and, in that case, the cape 
is like the gown. Gowns and petticoats are worn 
without any trimming of any kind. That is reserved for full dress only, when very large hoops 
and negligees, with trains three yards long, are 
worn. But these are not used, except at Court, 
and then only upon public occasions ; the Queen 
herself, and the ladies of honor, dressing very plain 
upon other days. Abby has made you a miniature 
handkerchief, just to show you one mode ; but caps, 
hats, and handkerchiefs are as various as ladies' and 
milliners' fancies can devise. 
Thus, Madam, having displayed the mode to you, 
be so good as to present <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a>'s and my regards to Mr. Storer, and, in one word, to all who 
inquire after your affectionate friend, 
</p><p>
A. Adams.
