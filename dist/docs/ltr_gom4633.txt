My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I wrote to you on the twenty- fourth of October, and have 
not since received any of your letters. In that I acknowledged yours of the 22d of June. You will have seen from the 
public prints the wonderful success of the French arms, arising from the following causes. 1. That the enemy, deceived 
by the emigrants, counted too lightly on the opposition he was 
to meet with. 2. That from like misinformation, instead of 
attacking on the northern frontier, backed by the resources of 
Flanders, and those which the ocean would supply, they came 
across the Ardennes to that part of Champaign, nicknamed 
the lousy, from its barrenness and misery. 3. That in this expedition, where the difficulty of the roads, transportation and 
communication was the greatest they expected, it so happened 
that the season, usually dry and fair, (when those bad roads 
are at the best) was one continued rain for two months, so that 
at length they were nearly stuck fast, and had as much as they 
could do to drag back their cannon, &c. through the mud. 
Lastly, that France brought into the field, and has kept up until very lately, the immense number of six hundred thousand 
troops. This has been done at an average expense of about 
five millions sterling per month beyond their resources, and 
yet they have ordered a like army for the next campaign, and 
talk boldly of meeting Great Britain also upon her element. 
What say you to that, Monsieur le Financier? But I will tell 
you in your ear, that in spite of that blustering, they will do 
much to avoid a war with Great Britain, if the people will let 
them, but the truth is, that the populace of Paris influence in 
a great degree the public councils. I think they will have 
quite as many men as they can maintain ; but what that may 
amount to is hard to determine. 
</p><p>
The ministers here are most extraordinary people. They 
make nothing of difficulties, as you shall judge by a single trait 
of M. Pache, the minister at War. He had sent Beurnonville 
to occupy the Moselle river down to Coblentz, taking Treves 
and other places in his way. Now this way lies through a very difficult mountainous country, in which the snow is very 
deep, therefore Beurnonville, having got a little neck of land 
between the Saar and the Moselle, puts his troops into winter 
quarters, pleading their nakedness as an excuse. The minister has sent him a brace of commissioners, who have power 
to impress in the neighborhood whatever may be needful for 
the troops, and then (their wants supplied) summon him to 
obey his orders. T have given to Mr Jefferson a pretty full 
account of the state of things, so that if you see that account, 
which I take it is of course, you may measure by the standard 
now given you all other affairs. 
</p><p>
If I may venture to judge from appearances, there is now in the wind a storm not unlike that of the second of September, 
Whether it will burst or blow over, it is impossible to determine. 
</p><p>
It has occurred to me, that I never yet assigned a reason 
why the completion of payment of six million livres, which at 
Mr Short's request I had stipulated for with the government 
lately abolished, appeared to me desirable. In effect, I left 
this as I do many other things to the sense of the gentle reader, but as readers are sometimes ungentle, it is not amiss to 
communicate that reason to a friend. I saw that the new 
government would be hungry, and would urge us for money in 
the double view of obtaining an acknowledgment of them, as 
well as of supplying their wants. It was therefore, I thought, 
right to take a position where we might say there is nothing 
due. This would leave open a question, which it would be 
very delicate to answer either way, as things appeared then, 
and as they are now that appearances have changed. You 
will have seen the manoeuvres to force me in that intrenchment ; but at last, like your friend General Lee, I was quite 
at the worst for a retrograde manoeuvre. 
</p><p>
But I concluded that supplies of money to support the 
colony of St Domingo would, in all events, have been considered as a good and effectual payment on our part, and, had my 
offer of recommending such supplies been accepted, I would 
on that ground have proposed the measure, which, anticipating 
the next instalments, would have still kept open the main 
point as long as you should think proper. And thus my 
apparent retreat was in effect a mode of more permanent 
defence, and this is more, I believe, than poor Lee could say 
for himself. I am truly yours, &ic.
