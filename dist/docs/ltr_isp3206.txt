DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
By order from <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a>, all the troops from this 
post, except about eleven hundred Continental and four hundred 
of the militia, are withdrawn. I have received intelligence, on 
which I fully depend, that the enemy had received a reenforcement at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, last Thursday, of about three thousand British and foreign troops ; that <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a> has called in 
guides, who belong about Croton River; has ordered hard bread 
baked; that the troops are called from Paulus Hook to King's Bridge, and the whole troops are now under marching orders. 
</p><p>
Under these circumstances, and from a variety of other considerations, I think it highly probable the designs of the enemy 
are against the posts in the Highlands, or some part of the counties of Westchester or Dutchess. Should their attack be upon 
the posts in the Highlands, you cannot have the least expectation 
the posts can be maintained, with our present force, against the 
strength the enemy may, or probably will send. When you con 
sider the infinite importance of the post to the general interest 
of the country, and of this State in particular, I cannot entertain 
a, doubt of your immediate attention to the defence of it. Unless a greater force than at present is here, or appears probable to 
be here, is supplied for the defence of the post, you must be 
sensible I cannot be answerable for the defence of it. I there 
fore beg you to pay an attention to this important post, and 
afford me a reinforcement of the militia, that will enable me to 
maintain it. If it is possible for you to pay a personal attention 
to this object, I shall be happy in your counsel and assistance, 
and am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your very humble servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
P. S. I received your favor of the 28th instant, and shall observe the contents. The ships are drawn up in the river, and I 
believe nothing prevents them from paying us an immediate visit, 
but the contrary wind.
