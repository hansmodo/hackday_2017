SIR, 
</p><p>
I wrote to you in January last a long letter, by Meyrick, and at the same time wrote to the Committee, since which I 
have received no line from any one in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, nor has Mr. Bollan yet received the answer we wait for, respecting the eastern settlements on the crown land.

The Parliament has been employed in the royal marriage 
bill, and other business; nothing of importance relating to a First published by Sparks. 
America has been mentioned hitherto during the session, 
and it is thought that India affairs will fill up the remainder 
of the time, to the prorogation. I have not met with Lord 
Hillsborough since my return from Ireland, seeing no use at 
present in attending his levees. The papers mentioned his 
intention of moving something in the House of Lords relating 
to America, but I cannot learn there was any truth in it. 
</p><p>
It is my present purpose to return home this summer, 
in which case, I suppose I am to leave your business and 
papers in the hands of Mr. Lee, which I shall do, if I do not 
receive other directions. 
</p><p>
Upon the present plan here of admitting no agent, but such 
as governors shall approve of, from year to year, and of course 
none but such as the ministry approves of, I do not conceive 
that agents can be of much use to you; and, therefore, I 
suppose you would rather decline appointing any. In my 
opinion, they have at all times been of full as much service 
to government here, as to the colonies from whence they 
come, and might still be so, if properly attended to, in preventing, by their better information, those disgraceful blunders of government, that arise from its ignorance of our situation, circumstances, abilities, temper, &c., such as the Stamp 
Act, which too would have been prevented, if the agents had 
been regarded. Therefore I should think, that, if agents 
can be allowed here on no other footing than is now proposed, 
we should omit sending any, and leave the crown, when 
it wants our aids, or would transact business with us, to 
send its minister to the colonies. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to present my respects to the Committee, and 
duty to the Assembly, and believe me, with sincere esteem, 
&c. B. FRANKLIN.
