Sir, 
</p><p>
I was yesterday honored with your Excellency's 
letter of the 21st, to the several directions in which 
I shall pay due attention. Yesterday I received a letter from Major Clairborne, dated the 12th instant, 
informing me that the two expresses, stationed at 
Bowling Green, had left it some days for want of support. As Colonel Carrington had comprehended, in 
his estimate for Virginia, one charge for expresses, I 
have desired him to ask <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a> for authority to 
engage actual payment, and then immediately to write 
Major Clairborne to replace and firmly fix the expresses, W'hom Colonel Carrington will pay on his return to Virginia. I will also apply for the Maryland district, and enable Mr. Yeates to keep his chain complete. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency advised that the ox-teams should 
be assembled by the middle of May last year. I 
would request your direction for the present year on 
this head. The longer their assembling is delayed, 
consistent with the expected operations, the better, 
on account of the pasturage, which, by the middle of 
May, is hardly sufficient for the support of the cattle. 
It is of importance, too, to preserve, as long as possible, all the forage in the vicinity of the army. I 
have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
