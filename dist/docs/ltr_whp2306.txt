MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met friend">Burr</a>,
</p><p>
I take the earliest opportunity of acknowledging the receipt of your
dateless letter, and returning you my best thanks for it. Mr. and
Mrs. Reeve have been so kind as to tarry a night with me. We
endeavoured to prevail upon them to pass a few days with us, and
should have been happy if we could have succeeded. This letter goes
with them. That circumstance cannot fail, of making it still more
welcome to your honest and. benevolent heart.
</p><p>
I wrote you the latter end of January from the Hermitage, and
intrusted the letter to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thb" rel="met friend">Mrs. Prevost</a>. It was a mere scrawl. This is of
the same cast. However, I promise, the very first leisure hour, to
devote it entirely to you in the letter way. Although I do not write
frequently to you, yet, believe me, I think frequently of you. Oh,
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met friend">Burr</a>! may you enjoy health, and be completely happy; as much so as I
am--more I cannot wish you. Nor will you be able to attain high
felicity until you experience such a union as I do. Mrs. Paterson is
in tolerable health, and gives you her best respects. I wish her
safely through the month of May, and then I shall be still more happy.
</p><p>
When you come to Jersey I shall certainly see you. If I do not, it
will be treason against our friendship.
</p><p>
Peace is distant. There is no prospect of it in the present year. Nor
do I think that Britain will come to terms while she fancies herself
superior on the ocean. The war, however, goes southward, and there is
some hope that we shall be more in quiet this year than we have been
since the commencement of hostilities. On the opening of the campaign
we shall be able to judge better. Adieu.
