MY DEAR MR. CRAMER:
</p><p>
On my arrival here I found your letter inquiring especially about the
time I expect to be in Copenhagen. My plan is to be in Sweden by the
middle of June, and after visiting that country and Norway, to return
by way of Copenhagen. It is not likely that I shall be there before the
fifth to the tenth of July, and it may be that I shall like the
northern country so well that my visit to Copenhagen will be postponed
even a month longer.
</p><p>
We have had a delightful winter. Over a month was spent in Egypt,
visiting the old ruins of that country under the most favorable
circumstances. Leaving Cairo we visited Suez and passed through the
Suez Canal to Port Said. From the latter place we went to Joppa and out
to Jerusalem. Since then we visited Smyrna and Ephesus and are now
here. The Russians are outside of the city but do not come in. A
stranger would not detect from appearances that an enemy was so near.
In fact I think the Turks now regard the Russians as about the only
people in Europe from whom they can expect anything.
</p><p>
When you write home give my love to Mother, Mary and children, and
Jennie.
</p><p>
I will inform you later, when I know definitely, about the time to
expect me in Copenhagen.
</p><p>
Very truly yours,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.
