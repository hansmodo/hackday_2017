<p><i>[Biographers Note:...on Christmas Day, he writes to my mother:]</i>
</p><p>
I cannot let this day of grateful rejoicing pass, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse sweetheart met">Mary</a>, without
some communication with you.  I am thankful for the many among the
past that I have passed with you, and the remembrance of them fills
me with pleasure.  For those on which we have been separated we must
not repine.  Now we must be content with the many blessings we receive.
If we can only become sensible of our transgressions, so as to be fully
penitent and forgiven, that this heavy punishment under which we labour
may with justice be removed from us and the whole nation, what a
gracious consummation of all that we have endured it will be!

I hope you had a pleasant visit to Richmond....  If you were to see
this place, I think you would have it, too.  I am here but little
myself.  The days I am not here I visit some point exposed to the
enemy, and after our dinner at early candle-light, am engaged in
writing till eleven or twelve o'clock at night....  AS to our old home,
if not destroyed, it will be difficult ever to be recognised.  Even
if the enemy had wished to preserve it, it would almost have been
impossible.  With the number of troops encamped around it, the change
of officers, etc., the want of fuel, shelter, etc., and all the dire
necessities of war, it is vain to think of its being in a habitable
condition.  I fear, too, books, furniture, and the relics of Mount
Vernon will be gone.  It is better to make up our minds to a general
loss.  They cannot take away the remembrance of the spot, and the
memories of those that to us rendered it sacred.  That will remain
to us as long as life will last, and that we can preserve.  In the
absence of a home, I wish I could purchase 'Stratford.'  That is the
only other place that I could go to, now accessible to us, that would
inspire me with feelings of pleasure and local love.  You and the
girls could remain there in quiet.  It is a poor place, but we could
make enough cornbread and bacon for our support, and the girls could
weave us clothes.  I wonder if it is for sale and at how much.  Ask
Fitzhugh to try to find out, when he gets to Fredericksburg.  You must
not build your hopes on peace on account of the United States going
into a war with England [on account of the Trent affair].  She will
be very loath to do that, notwithstanding the bluster of the Northern
papers.  Her rulers are not entirely mad, and if they find England is
in earnest, and that war or a restitution of their captives must be
the consequence, they will adopt the latter.  We must make up our minds
to fight our battles and win our independence alone.  No one will help
us.  We require no extraneous aid, if true to ourselves.  But we must
be patient.  It is not a light achievement and cannot be accomplished
at once....  I wrote a few days since, giving you all the news, and
have now therefore nothing to relate.  The enemy is still quiet and
increasing in strength.  We grow in size slowly but are working hard.
I have had a day of labour instead of rest, and have written intervals
to some of the children.  I hope they are with you, and inclose my
letters....
