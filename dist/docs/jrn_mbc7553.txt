I did not know that one could live such days of excitement. Some one called : "Come out ! There 
is a crowd coming." A mob it was, indeed, but it was headed by Colonels Chesnut and Manning. The crowd was 
shouting and showing these two as messengers of good news. They were escorted to <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard's</a> headquarters.

story once or twice before.

When we had calmed down, Colonel Chesout. who had taken it all quietly enough, if anything more unruffled

about. Wigfall was with them on Morris Island when they saw the fire in the fort; he jumped in a little boat, and 
with his handkerchief as a white flag, rowed over. Wigfall went in through a porthole. When Colonel Chesnut 
arrived shortly after, and was received at the regular entrance, Colonel Anderson told him he had need to pick his 
way warily, for the place was all mined. As far as I can make out the fort surrendered to Wigfall. But it is all confusion. Our flag is flying there. Fire-engines have been sent for to put out the fire. Everybody tells you half of 
something and then rushes off to tell something else or to hear the last news.

In the afternoon, Mrs. Preston/ Mrs*.... Joe- Heyward, 
and I drove around the Battery. We were in an open carriage. What a changed scene the very liveliest crowd I 
think I ever saw, everybody talking at once. All glasses were still turned on the grim old fort.

Russell, the correspondent of the London Times, was there. They took him everywhere. One man got out 
Thackeray to converse with him on equal terms. Poor Russell was awfully bored, they say. He only wanted 
to see the fort and to get news suitable to make up into an interesting article. Thackeray had become stale over the water.

Mrs. Frank Hampton and I went to see the camp of the Richland troops. South Carolina College had volunteered 
to a boy. Professor Venable (the mathematical) , intends to 
raise a company from among them for the war, a permanent company. This is a grand frolic no more for the students, at least. Even the staid and severe of aspect, Clingman, is here. He says Virginia and North Carolina are 
arming to come to our rescue, for now the North will swoop down on us. Of that we may be sure. We have 
burned our ships. We are obliged to go on now. He calls us a poor, little, hot-blooded, headlong, rash, and trouble 
some sister State. General McQueen is in a rage because we are to send troops to Virginia.

Preston Hampton is in all the flush of his youth and beauty, six feet in stature ; and after all only in his teens ; 
he appeared in fine clothes and lemon-colored kid gloves to grace the scene. The camp in a fit of horse-play seized him 
and rubbed him in the mud. He fought manfully, but took it all naturally as a good joke.

Mrs. Prank Hampton knows already what civil war means. Her brother was in the New York Seventh Regiment, so roughly received in Baltimore. Frank will be in the opposite camp.

Good stories there may be and to spare for Russell, the man of the London Times, who has come over here to find 
out our weakness and our strength and to tell all the rest of the world about us.
