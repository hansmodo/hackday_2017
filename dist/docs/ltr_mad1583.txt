DEAR Sir, I have received, and acknowledge with great 
pleasure, your favor of the 8th inst. The remarks which you 
make on the act of the Convention appear to me to be in general extremely well founded. Your criticism on the clause exempting vessels bound to and from a State from being obliged 
to enter, &c., in another, is particularly so. This provision was 
dictated by the jealousy of some particular States, and was inserv.d pretty late in the Session. The object of it was what you 
conjecture. The expression is certainly not accurate. Is not a 
religious test, as far as it is necessary, or would operate, involved in the oath itself? If the person swearing believes in 
the Supreme Being, who is invoked, and in the penal consequences of offending him, either in this or a future world, or 
both, he will be under the same restraint from perjury as if he 
had previously subscribed a test requiring this belief. If the 
person in question be an unbeliever in these points, and would, 
notwithstanding, take the oath, a previous test could have no 
effect. He would subscribe it as he would take the oath, without any principle that could be affected by either.

I find, by a letter from Mr. Dawson, that the proposed Constitution is received by the Assembly with a more prompt and 
general approbation than could well have been expected. The 
example of Virginia will have great weight, and the more so, 
as the disagreement of the deputation will give it more the appearance of being the unbiassed expression of the public mind. 
It would be truly mortifying if anything should occur to prevent or retard the concurrence of a State which has generally 
taken the lead on great occasions. And it would be the more 
so in this case, as it is generally believed that nine of the States 
at least will embrace the plan, and, consequently, that the tardy 
remainder must be reduced to the dilemma of either shifting for 
themselves, or coming in without any credit for it.

There is reason to believe that the Eastern States, Rhode 
Island excepted, will be among the foremost in adopting the 
system. No particular information is yet received from New 
Hampshire. The presumptive evidence of its good disposition, 
however, is satisfactory. The Legislature of Massachusetts is 
now sitting, andfrom good authority say that everything goes well. Connecticut has unanimously called a Convention, and left no room to doubt her favorable disposition. 
This State has long had the character of being anti-federal. 
Whether she will purge herself of it on this occasion, or not, is 
yet to be ascertained. Most of the respectable characters are 
zealous on the right side. The party in power is suspected, on 
good grounds, to be on the wrong one. New Jersey adopts 
eagerly the Constitution. Pennsylvania is considerably divided; 
but the majority are, as yet, clearly with the Convention. I 
have no very late information from Maryland. The reports are, 
that the opposition will make no great figure. Not a word has 
been heard from the States South of Virginia, except from the 
lower parts of North Carolina, where the Constitution was well 
received. There can be little doubt, I think, that the three 
Southern States will go right, unless the conduct of Virginia 
were to mislead them. I enclose two of the last newspapers of 
this place, to which I add one of Philad a , containing the report 
of a late important decision of the Supreme Court there. If 
the report be faithful, I suspect it will not give you a high idea 
of the chancery knowledge of the Chief Justice.

I am, dear sir, with sincere affection, your obt friend and 
serv.
