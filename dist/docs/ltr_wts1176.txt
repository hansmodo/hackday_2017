Dear Brother : I got your letter, and have this morning answered by telegraph, but wish to write more fully. 
When here last winter, I did not call to say good-by to 
the President, and wrote him a good letter of apology, 
enclosing my good wishes for his success in his professed 
desire to accomplish in his term of office the restoration 
of Civil Government all over our land. When I got in 
to Kiley I received a despatch from the President, asking 
leave to publish it. I answered that he could publish 
anything I ever wrote if it would do any good, if Mr. 
Stanbury would advise it, but desiring, if possible, to 
avoid any controversy. On this he did not publish, and 
I have not made any request in the premises. I don't 
believe he will publish it, and I don't care much, for it 
contains nothing more than I thought then; viz., in February last, when I got here, there was a move to send 
Grant to Mexico with Campbell in an advisory capacity. 
Grant could not then be put to one side in that way, and 
on my arrival I found out that the President was aiming 
to get Grant out of the way, and me in, not only as 
Secretary of War but to command the army, on the supposition that I would be more friendly to him than 
Grant. Grant was willing that I should be Secretary of 
War, but I was not. I would not be put in such a 
category, and after much pro and con we have settled 
down that I shall go with Campbell. The Secretary of 
the Navy is preparing a steamer for us, and it will be 
ready next week at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, when we will go forth 
to search for the Governor of Mexico ; not a task at all 
to my liking, but I cheerfully consented because it removes at once a crisis. Both Grant and I desire to keep 
plainly and strictly to our duty in the Army, and not to 
be construed as partisans. We must be prepared to 
serve every administration as it arises. We recognize 
Mr. Johnson as the lawful President, without committing ourselves in the remotest degree to an approval or 
disapproval of his specific acts. We recognize the present Congress as the lawful Congress of the United 
States, and its laws binding on us and all alike, and we 
are most anxious to see, somehow or other, the Supreme 
Court brought in to pass on the legal and constitutional 
differences between the President and Congress. 
</p><p>
We see nothing objectionable in the proposed amendments to the Constitution, only there ought to have been 
some further action on the part of Congress committing 
it to the admission of members when the amendments 
are adopted; also the minor exceptions to hold office, 
etc., should be relaxed as the people show an adherence 
to the national cause. ... I feel sure the President 
is so in the habit of being controlled by popular majorities that he will yield save he may argue against 
Congress and in favor of his own past-expressed opinions. Congress should not attempt an impeachment or 
interference with the current acts of the executive 
unless some overt act clearly within the definition of the 
Constitution be attempted, of which I see no signs whatever. Some very bad appointments have been made, but 
I find here that he was backed by long lists of names 
that were Union men in the war. Of course our army 
cannot be in force everywhere : to suppress riots in the 
South, Indians in that vast region, only a part of which 
we saw, where whites and Indians both require watching, and the thousand and one duties that devolve on us. 
This army can never be used in the political complications, nothing more than to hold arsenals, depots, etc., 
against riots, or to form the nucleus of an army of which 
Congress must provide the laws for government and the 
means of support. Neither the President nor Congress 
ought to ask us of the army to manifest any favor or 
disfavor to any political measures. "We are naturally 
desirous for harmonious action for peace and civility. 
We naturally resist the clamor of temporary popular 
changes, but as each administration comes in we must 
serve its executive and the War Department with 
seeming friendship. 
</p><p>
I have called on Mr. Stanton, who received me with 
all cordiality, and placed at my disposal ample means to 
execute my present task with ease and comfort. 
</p><p>
I start from here to-night, and shall reach <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a> on 
Friday night, ready to start for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> as soon as the 
vessel is ready and as soon as Campbell is ready, say 
all next week. ... I don't know that I can come by 
way of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mansfield" rel="city">Mansfield</a>, as, you see, I must move fast, staying 
every spare minute I can at home. Write me fully, 
and let us all pull together and get past this present 
difficulty; then all will be well. . . . 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
