DEAR SIR, The letter herewith enclosed was put into my 
hands yesterday by Mr. de Crevecceur, who belongs to the Consular establishment of France in this country. I add to it a 
pamphlet which Mr. Pinckney has submitted to the public, or 
rather, as he professes, to the perusal of his friends, and a 
printed sheet containing his ideas on a very delicate subject, 
too delicate, in my opinion, to have been properly confided to 
the press. He conceives that his precautions against any further 
circulation of the piece than he himself authorizes are so effectual as to justify the step. I wish he may not be disappointed. 
In communicating a copy to you, I fulfil his wishes only.

No decisive indications of the public mind in the Northern 
and middle States can yet be collected. The reports continue to 
be rather favorable to the act of the Convention from every quarter; but its adversaries will naturally be latest in shewing themselves. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> is certainly friendly. An opposition is known 
to be in petto in Connecticut, but it is said not to be much 
dreaded by the other side. Rhode Island will be divided on 
this subject in the same manner that it has been on the question 
of paper money. The newspapers here have contained sundry 
publications animadverting on the proposed Constitution, and 
it is known that the Government party are hostile to it. There 
are on the other side so many able and weighty advocates, and 
the conduct of the Eastern States, if favorable, will add so much 
force to their arguments, that there is at least as much ground 
for hope as for apprehension. I do not learn that any opposition is likely to be made in New Jersey. The temper of Pennsylvania will be best known to you from the direct information 
which you cannot fail to receive through the newspapers and 
other channels.

Congress have been of late employed chiefly in settling the 
requisition, and in making some arrangements for the Western 
country. The latter consist of the appointment of a Governor 
and Secretary, and the allotment of a sum of money for Indian 
treaties, if they should be found necessary. The requisition, so 
far as it varies our fiscal system, makes the proportion of Indents receivable independently of specie, and those of different 
years indiscriminately receivable for any year, and does not, as 
heretofore, tie down the States to a particular mode of obtaining them. Mr. Adams has been permitted to return home after 
February next, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="friend colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a>'s appointment continued for 
three years longer. 
</p><p>
With the most perfect esteem, and most affectionate regard, 
I remain, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your obt friend and serv.
