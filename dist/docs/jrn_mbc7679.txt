<a rel='month origin' value='12'>December</a> <a rel='day origin' value='10'>10th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1863' rel="origin">1863</a>]. <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> and Mrs. Lyons came. We had luncheon brought in for them, and then a lucid explanation of the chronique scandaleuse, of which Beck J. is the heroine. We walked home with <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> and met 
the President riding alone. Surely that is wrong. It must be unsafe for him when there are so many traitors, not to 
speak of bribed negroes. Burton Harrison says <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis</a> prefers to go alone, and there is none to gainsay him.

My husband laid the law down last night. I felt it to be the last drop in my full cup. "No more feasting in this 
house," said he. " This is no time for junketing and merrymaking. " " And you said you brought me here to enjoy 
the winter before you took me home and turned my face to a dead wall." He is the master of the house; to hear is to obey.
