Near night Senator Cass called, and informed me that the Senate had rejected the report of the committee of conference of the two houses on the disagreeing votes between them on the bill to raise ten additional regiments. The effect of this vote is the rejection of the bill. I learn it was rejected by the united vote of the Federal party in the Senate, and by the votes of Mr. Calhoun and his peculiar friends in the Senate. I now regard Mr. Calhoun to be in opposition to my administration. He has been dissatisfied ever since I refused to retain him in my Cabinet at the commencement of my administration, and is now, I have reason to believe, as decidedly opposed to my administration in his heart as any member of the Federal party. He is an aspirant for the Presidency, and the truth is that the next Presidential election has divided the Demo cratic party in Congress into factions, each adhering to their favourites, and the effect is to reduce the administration to a minority in Congress, and to paralyze and defeat all my measures. In the Senate three or four Democrats who may dissent from the body of the party can defeat any measure. The Federal party never fails to unite with such minority and thus constitute the majority. Mr. Calhoun can carry with him that many votes, and I now consider him the most mischievous man in the Senate to my administration. The people must be made to understand this state of things. With a nominal majority in each house, I am in truth in a minority in each.
