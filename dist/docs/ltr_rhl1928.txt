MY DEAREST SIR By Captain Talman, I was favoured with your obliging letter of April last, before the receipt of which, I had been informed of the fatal blow 
given to American liberty, by the ever to be detested stamp act. I am greatly obliged to you, my best friend, for your design of helping me to that collection;* but it 
is very well that the appointment has passed me, since, by the unanimous suffrage of his countrymen is 
regarded as an execrable monster, who with parricidal heart and hands, hath concern in the ruin of his native country. The light in which our Assembly viewed that 
act, may be collected from their resolves at the last meeting, which occasioned their dissolution. I would have sent you a copy, had I not been persuaded that some 
of your numerous friends had done so already.

Have you read a pamphlet said to be written by George Grenville, in which he has, in vain, laboured to prove the legislative right of Britain to tax America? If 
no better arguments can be produced in support of the measures he contends for, it proves the intrinsic vileness 
of his scheme; and shows indeed, that systems calculated to destroy public liberty, can be maintained only by idle sophistry and a poor affectation of wit. It is most 
clear, that such doctrines are as far remote from true policy as they are apparently the production of a futile dealer in expedients, who understands not to draw the 
necessary supplies of government from such sources only as are consistent with the end of all government, the safety, ease, and happiness of the people. 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately,
