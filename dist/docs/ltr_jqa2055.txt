DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
At the close of my last letter I mentioned the arrival of 
General Pichegru, with a considerable body of French troops ; 
at the same time came five Commissioners of the Convention, deputed to the two armies of the North and of Sambre 
and Meuse. The troops are quartered upon the inhabitants. 
The Commissioners occupy the house of Mr. Hope who has 
quitted the country. The General is quartered upon one 
of the wealthiest partizans of the former government, and 
every house in the city is ordered to receive two men upon 
application. 
</p><p>
The states of Holland have given orders to all their officers and commanders to make no further resistance against 
the French armies. All the principal cities of the Province 
have admitted their troops upon capitulation. Hitherto 
no disorders have taken place, no massacres, no pillage, not 
even any personal insult to the conspicuous characters of 
the party heretofore dominant. The order and discipline 
of the troops are almost without an exception. In short, 
at this moment, it is scarcely possible for us who are spectators to conceive that what we have witnessed is in reality 
the complicated transaction of a foreign conquest and an internal revolution. 
</p><p>
As the property belonging to the United States and their 
citizens in this country could not be subject to the terms of 
a capitulation, I thought it might be of some utility to see 
the Commissaries, and give them notice of the expectation 
that the neutral privileges of American property will at all 
events be respected. 
</p><p>
I accordingly paid them a visit this day, and was received 
in a manner perfectly satisfactory. The interview consisted 
principally of mutual compliments and expressions of civility, 
which it is unnecessary to repeat, but in the course of the 
conversation I told them, that the principles they had ob 
served in the midst of victory, and the discipline and 
regularity, which so honorably distinguished the French 
armies now in this country, perhaps rendered useless any 
observations of mine upon the subject of property belonging 
to my country or my fellow citizens. That, however, as a 
different mode of warfare might have been pursued, the 
duties of my situation rendered it proper on my part to 
assure them of my full persuasion that, upon any contingency whatever, all the American citizens and property here 
would enjoy all the protection and security to which they are entitled. The citizen who appeared to be at the head 
of the deputation, and who held the principal conversation 
with me answered, that American persons and property 
will be under the same common safeguard with those be 
longing to this nation, of the principles by which the conduct 
of the French people is dictated, and of the loyalty and regularity constantly observed by the French armies. That the 
French people did not come here as enemies of the Dutch 
people, nor had they any intention of offering violence to 
their persons, their property, or their opinions. That if in 
the course of circumstances it should be necessary to make 
any exceptions, the Representatives of the French people 
would certainly make the strongest representations to their 
constituents in behalf of those whom they considered as 
their first friends, of a free people for whom they had the 
highest regard and attachment. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the protection extended to all private 
property, I presume that in consequence of the present 
circumstances the natives here will before any great lapse 
of time be subjected to burdens, from which the citizens of 
the United States will think the property belonging to them 
within the Republic entitled to an exemption. These bur 
dens may appear in the form of a requisition or a contribution, and perhaps in a form which we cannot anticipate. 
The Commissioners enquired if I knew what number of 
vessels and what other property of our citizens there is 
here. I answered them, I did not. With respect to the 
vessels I shall take measures to ascertain it, but for the 
rest, I am confident I shall not be informed until it becomes 
a subject of absolute necessity, in order to save the property 
from the effect of an established regulation. One American 
citizen and one English consignee of several others, are the 
only persons who have delivered to me any statements of 
property, for which they demanded the protection of our 
neutrality, and I find the other merchants, holders of 
American merchandise, averse to any communication which 
they think is not yet of absolute necessity. . .
