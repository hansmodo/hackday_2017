DEAR SIR, Your last received was of the 28 April. The 
receipt of all the preceding is verified by the uninterrupted 
dates of the Gazettes inclosed. I anxiously wish that the re 
ception of Genet may testify what I believe to be the real affections of the people. It is the more desirable, as a seasonable 
plum after the bitter pills which it seems must be administered. 
Having neither the Treaty nor law of Nations at hand, I form 
no opinion as to the stipulations of the former, or the precise 
neutrality denned by the latter. I had always supposed that 
the terms of the Treaty made some sort of difference, at least as 
far as would consist with the Law of Nations, between France 
and Nations not in Treaty, particularly Great Britain. I should 
still doubt whether the term impartial, in the Proclamation, is 
not stronger than was necessary, if not than was proper. Peace 
is no doubt to be preserv. at any price that honor and good 
faith will permit. But it is no less to be considered that the 
least departure from these will not only be most likely to end 
in the loss of peace, but is pregnant with every other evil that 
could happen to us. In explaining our own engagements under 
the Treaty with France, it would be honorable as well as just 
to adhere to the sense that would at the time have been put on 
them. The attempt to shuffle off the Treaty altogether, by 
quibbling on Vattel, is equally contemptible for the meanness 
and folly of it. If a change of Government is an absolution 
from public engagements, why not from those of a domestic as 
well as of a foreign nature; and what then becomes of public 
debts, &c., &c? In fact, the doctrine would perpetuate every 
existing Despotism, by involving in a reform of the Government 
a destruction of the social pact, an annihilation of property, 
and a compleat establishment of the state of nature. What 
most surprises me is, that such a proposition should have been 
discussed.

Our weather has not been favorable of late, owing more to 
want of sun than excess of rain. Vegetation of all sorts, even 
</p><p>
the wheat, nevertheless continues to flourish; and the fruit having no longer anything to fear from frost, we are sure of good 
crops of that agreeable article. 
</p><p>
Yours always and affectionately. 
</p><p>
Will you send me a copy of the little pamphlet advertised 
under the title of an examination of the proceedings in the case 
of the Secretary of the Treasury?
