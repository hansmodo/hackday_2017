TO JAMES MADISON, ESQ. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">PHILA</a>., June 5, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1783">1783</a>. 
</p><p>
HON'D SlR, By the post preceding the last, I answered yours 
of the 16th, addressing it to the care of Mr. Maury. I was 
prevented by more necessary writing from enclosing the papers again by the last post, as I had intended. I now supply 
the omission by two gentlemen going to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>. All 
the news we have received is contained in them, and respects 
solely the arrangement which is at length made of a British 
Ministry. 
</p><p>
Having sent several copies of the pamphlet of Congress on 
the subject of revenue, &c., which I suppose will be transcribed 
in the Virginia gazettes, I shall add nothing on that subject, 
presuming that you will, through some channel or other, obtain 
a sight of these proceedings. I enclose a memorandum of the 
books which I wish you to select from Dr. Hamilton's catalogue. 
</p><p>
I shall take care not to disappoint you of the chair which I 
promised to bring with me. The time of my setting out is as 
uncertain as at the date of my last but it will certainly take 
place before the Fall. 
</p><p>
Remember me affly to my mother and all the family, and be 
assured that I am, your dutiful son. 
</p>
