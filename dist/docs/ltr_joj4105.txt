Dear Sir. 
</p><p>
I have this moment been favoured with your letter of the 
10th of this month. Mr. Sedgwick has given me the same 
character of Mr. Tucker that you do. There are at present several candidates for the place in question,* and probably the number will be increased before the appointment 
takes place. As it should be the result of mutual information and joint consultation between the judges, it appears to 
me proper that I should in the mean time remain free from 
engagements, express or implied, to or for any gentleman, 
however well recommended. The reserve which this consideration imposes will not permit me to enlarge upon this 
subject ; but I know of no consideration which should restrain 
me from assuring you very explicitly of the esteem with 
which I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
