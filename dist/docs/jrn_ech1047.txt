I tried my hand at mining for a few weeks, but upon dividing the gold we dug during my last week, we found that we had only about 1 1/4 pounds. I hired a man to dig in my place for five dollars a day and again commenced sticking type on the 5th of November, for Marvin and Gunn. Judge Marvin was a partner of Mr. White, former editor of the Herald, who has left this place. A few weeks later, I purchased one-half of the Sonora Herald, as I should otherwise have lost the several hundred dollars which one of the proprietors owed me. Dr. Lewis C. Gunn from Philadelphia and a first-rate man, is now my partner. He is a finely educated gentleman and practicing physician, probably the only man in this place who does not drink, gamble or swear. Our office is in the good adobe house where we live and we are almost as comfortable as at home. John L. Haines, Clint Atkins, and Enoch Davis are in the house with us. We do our own cooking and washing and have some very pleasant times in conversing of old acquaintances and friends whom we have left far behind but not forgotten.

I have now been in this country almost a year and as yet have accumulated but little cash, but we have gotten our paper fairly started and it is increasing in value every day. We are not enabled to print a handsome sheet as we are in the mountains, several thousand miles from a type foundry. But we do the best we can. I think if I remain here about another year, I will be able to sell out and return home to the dearest spot on earth.
