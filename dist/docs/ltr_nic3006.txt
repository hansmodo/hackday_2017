SIR, 
</p><p>
I am to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency's letter of the 6th instant, and to inform you, 
that, zealous to do every thing in our power to 
serve the common cause of America, the Committee 
have determined, instead of the small armed sloop, 
to send the large vessel, with fifty men, upon the 
Bermuda enterprise ; with orders to Captain Whipple 
to cruise ten days off Sandy Hook for the packet 
expected from England; and, if he is so fortunate as 
to meet her, to put the letters ashore at South 
Hampton, and send them by express to your Excellency. She will sail, wind and weather permitting, 
the beginning of the week. 
</p><p>
There is in this town a Mr. De Ville. a French 
man, who hath made several voyages from this port 
during the last four or five years, and is esteemed a 
person every way well qualified, and to be depended 
upon, for the execution of the plan he proposes. 
He was with Captain Hopkins the last voyage, 
when lie imported the ammunition, &c,, lately purchased of Messrs. Clarke & Nightingale for the 
army; and hath brought with him a set of papers 
to qualify a brig as a French bottom. 
</p><p>
His scheme is to proceed to Bayonne, in France, 
where he is well acquainted, and there to take in a 
load of powder, which he says can be effected in 
three days. This despatch will be so great, that intelligence of the vessel cannot be sent to England 
timely enough for any measures to be taken to intercept her upon her return. I think the plan practicable, and likely to be attended with success. We 
have here a brig, a fast sailer, and otherwise a suitable vessel for the voyage, which will bring about eighty tons, and we will undertake to fit one quarter of her, and to supply the money to purchase one quarter part of the quantity of powder; which is the most we can do here. 
</p><p>
I have written to <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a> upon this subject, and desired him, if the plan meets with his 
approbation, to despatch a trusty person to confer with you upon it ; who can return through <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, and let me know the result, so that we may 
immediately equip the vessel for the voyage. 
</p><p>
I have communicated to Messrs. Clarke & Nightingale that part of your letter that related to them. 
They desire me to present to you their respectful thanks for the polite notice you have taken of them. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with much esteem and 
regard, &c., &c., 
</p><p>
