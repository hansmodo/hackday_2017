MY DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
The President has not resigned, but there appears to be a most violent attack carried on against him, the object of 
which is probably to induce his resignation, or his removal at the next election. In this country the same people who 
derived so much pleasure from the Western Insurrection of 
the last year, take an equal satisfaction in this circumstance. 
They seem to anticipate with delight the fall of a man, who 
has hitherto been the boast of Republicans. Time will 
show, whether in this instance, as in the former, these exulters have not purchased the skin before the chase was killed. 
</p><p>
But Mr. Randolph has resigned, and as to the origin of his resignation there are, as usual, two stories. His friends 
say that it was only certain indiscreet communications between him and the French Minister Fauchet, and they very 
much blame the President for having made an eclat of a thing, which they think ought to have been overlooked or arranged without noise. 
</p><p>
They further threaten very hard, that Mr. Randolph, to 
vindicate himself, will divulge some dreadful secrets as to 
the English party among us, and if there be such secrets I 
hope he will. It is time that the people of America should 
know who are their true friends, and who only the tools of 
foreign powers. 
</p><p>
The matter is yet unsettled, but is in every respect a thing 
to be regretted. But it gives great pleasure to our (not 
friends) in England. . . . 
</p><p>
