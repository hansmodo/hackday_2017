MR. HALL, by whom this letter will be sent, will carry several letters to you, which have been written and 
delivered to him several days. He has settled his business agreeably. I have not received a line from 
the Massachusetts since I left it Whether we shall return to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> soon or not, I cannot say. I 
rather conjecture it will not be long. You may write to me, in Congress, and the letter will be brought me wherever I shall be.

I am settled now, agreeably enough, in my lodgings. There is nothing in this respect that lies uneasily upon my mind, except the most extravagant price 
which I am obliged to give for every thing. My constituents will think me extravagant, but I am not. I 
wish I could sell or send home my horses, but I can not. I must have horses and a servant, for Congress 
will be likely to remove, several times, in the course of the ensuing year. I am impatient to hear from 
you, and most tenderly anxious for your health and happiness. I am also most affectionately solicitous for my dear children, to whom remember Yours.

We long to hear of the formation of a new army. We shall lose the most happy opportunity of destroying the enemy this spring if we do not exert ourselves 
instantly. We have from New Hampshire a Colonel Thornton, a physician by profession, a man of humor. 
He has a large budget of droll stories with which he entertains company perpetually. I heard, about twenty 
or five and twenty years ago, a story of a physician 
in Londonderry, who accidentally met with one of our 
New England enthusiasts, called exhortors. The fanatic soon began to examine the Doctor concerning 
the articles of his faith and what he thought of origin 
al sin. " Why," says the Doctor, " I satisfy myself 
about it in this manner. Either original sin is divisible or indivisible. If it is divisible, every descend 
ant of Adam and Eve must have a part and the share 
which falls to each individual at this day is so small a 
particle that I think it is not worth considering. If indivisible, then the whole quantity must have descended in a right line, and must now be possessed 
by one person only ; and the chances are millions and 
millions and millions to one, that that person is now in 
Asia or Africa, and thai I have nothing to do with it." 
I told Thornton the story, and that I suspected him to 
be the man. He said he was. He belongs to Londonderry.
