The morning was clear, and unusually mild for this season of the year. According to an invariable custom which has been observed by all my predecessors, the President's mansion is thrown open for the reception of visitors on the first day of every year. Neither House of Congress ever sits on that day, and accordingly both Houses adjourned over on yesterday. Between eleven and twelve o'clock A.M. the company commenced assembling. In the course of an hour an immense throng filled every hall and parlour in the house. The foreign ministers attended in their full court costumes. The Cabinet were of course present; as also the judges of the Supreme Court. Many Senators and Representatives in Congress attended, and among them I observed an unusual number of the Federal members. A large number of strangers as well as citizens, including the subordinate officers of government, were present. I stood on my feet shaking hands with the immense crowd from half past eleven o'clock A.M., till three o'clock P.M. . . About four o'clock the company had all retired. I was very much exhausted by the fatigues of the day.
