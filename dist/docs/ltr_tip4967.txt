On the 28th of July we arrived on the banks of the 
River Delaware, at Cory ell's Ferry, about thirty-two miles 
from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> by land, and there we halted. Last night 
the General and his family arrived here. Yesterday morn 
ing, about half after nine o clock, an express came to the 
General to inform him of the arrival of the enemy's fleet 
at the Capes of the river. Orders were immediately issued 
for all the troops upon the river (being eight brigades) to 
cross with all despatch possible ; two more brigades at <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>, under <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker'>General Sullivan</a>, and two more from Peeks- 
kill, are to follow as expeditiously as they can. All, we 
trust, will arrive before the enemy can take any decisive 
measures. The militia from this State, Jersey, and Mary 
land will, no doubt, turn out with spirit. The people of 
the city seem to be quite at ease, and not by any means to 
dread the enemy's approach. Fighting there must be, no 
doubt. God grant we may give them an overthrow, which, 
if general, must probably decide the contest. The army is 
in high spirits, and the order to march this way gave universal joy. The General and all the principal officers much 
prefer the enemy's coming here to their going up the North 
River, or to New England. For to this place the army will 
have but little way to march ; and, as it is an event long 
expected, it is presumed the people are better prepared to 
give the enemy a proper reception. However, if they 
should even gain this city, the cause will not be given up 
as lost; the enemy will, I trust, have a great deal more 
work to do before they conquer America. Though we have 
met with many losses, yet even now the inhabitants of 
America seem not to be actuated by a becoming ardor. 
Greater sufferings will show us the necessity of more universally spirited exertions ; and, when they take place, we shall 
undoubtedly, under <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, prevail over our enemies. 
Tis now past noon, and I have heard nothing more of the 
enemy's fleet, except a slight report that they were still at 
the Capes, which, I am inclined to think, is true ; for, if 
they had made any considerable progress, we should 
doubtless have heard of it. So much for news. . . .
