Dear Sir ; 
</p><p>
Your favor of this date came duly to hand I shall certainly not undertake anything (capital) without your knowledge I wish for your opinion 
as a friend not as a commanding officer of the light Troops whether another attempt upon <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=stoney point" rel="place">Stoney Point</a>, by way of surprize, is eligible (In any other 
manner under present appearances, and information, no good, I am sure, can result from it).- 
</p><p>
Lord Cornwallis is undoubtedly arrived, and I have information that bears all the marks of authenticity, that Admiral Arbuthnot with the 
grand fleet left Torbay the 26th of May, with (as it is said) 7000 Troops, Hessians and British, for America A deserter who left the City of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> on Tuesday 
last says, it was reported that a number of Transports had arrived at Sandy Hook Firing he himself heard I have not heard, nor is it my belief, that Lord Cornwallis supercedes Sir Harry. 
</p><p>
I am very sincerely and 
</p><p>
Affectionately 
</p><p>
D'r Sir 
</p><p>
