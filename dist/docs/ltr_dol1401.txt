<p>
TO PAYNE TODD, ESQ. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=montpelier" rel="city">Montpelier</a>, April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1823">1823</a>. 
</p><p>
I am impatient to hear from you, my dearest Payne, and had I known where to 
direct I should have written you before this : not that there is anything particular 
to communicate, but for the pleasure of repeating how much I love you, and to hear of your happiness. 
</p><p>
Your father received the journal of " Las Casas," with your name in it, from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, which is an indication that you are there, and I write accordingly. 
We returned yesterday from Monticello, after passing three days with Mr. Jefferson and one with Judge Nelson. 
</p><p>
Ellen and Virginia were indisposed, but all the others, with Mr. Jefferson, are well ; 
they hoped to have seen you with us. I inclose a letter your father received from 
General Taylor, as, perhaps, you might draw on him without knowing his payment 
was intended to be made you so soon. Let me know when you propose leaving 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> and your route, that I may send you some commissions. Adieu, my 
dear boy. Your father joins me in affectionate wishes for you. Your 
</p><p>
MOTHER.
