Sir, 
</p><p>
My feelings as a private friend, and the very great 
personal regard for your Excellency with which I 
have been penetrated ever since I had the honor of 
an acquaintance with you, would by no means allow 
me to see you retiring from your important employments without paying you my particular attentions. 
But when, as a public man, warmly attached to the 
interest of my country, I consider the nature of those 
services which you have rendered to that country; 
when I recollect the cares you have sustained, the 
fatigues you have endured, and the dangers you have confronted, for the public safety ; when I call to mind 
the many instances in which your abilities, your prudence, your fortitude and patience, have been superior 
to the severest trials ; and when I now see the great 
object of all so completely obtained in the establishment of the independence and peace of the United 
States; - my heart is too full to forbear to congratulate your Excellency in the most respectful and affectionate manner, upon an issue so happy to them, and 
so glorious to yourself 
</p><p>
To all your services, as Commander-in-chief of an 
army that has, in a manner astonishing to the whole 
world, efficaciously supported the freedom of America, 
you have constantly added, and particularly in your 
late circular letter to the States, the result of your 
uncommon wisdom and experience as a statesman, to 
assist us in improving, to the happiest purposes, the 
advantages gained by our arms. 
</p><p>
After such services, which consecrate your name 
to all posterity, with what home-felt satisfaction must 
your future days be blest ! Heaven crown them with 
every favor ! May you long live, my dear General, 
and long have the joy to see the increasing splendor 
and prosperity of a rising nation, aided by your 
counsels, and defended by your sword! Indulge me 
the pleasure to believe that I have a place in your 
recollection, and still honor and make me happy in 
your friendship. I have the honor to be, with the 
most perfect sentiments of regard and esteem, dear 
General, your 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very faithful, humble servant,
