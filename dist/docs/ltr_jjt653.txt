My dear Sister
</p><p>
Last week I mailed a letter to Mr. Arnold requesting him to visit me and [illegible] other inducements told him that we were to have a county agricultural Fair, but didn't mention the day, as I had not yet ascertained it; but it is to be on the 23 of this month. Urge Mr. Arnold to come if you think that he can do so safely; and during his stay, I will try & interest him in our schools & county, and see if he can be induced to locate here.
</p><p>
I found that the cadets designed being absent so short a time, that I concluded that I had better postpone my visit to you until next summer.
</p><p>
I feel that we are now greatly blessed with a good teacher for boys, he is the very man I think whom Thomas would do well under. We have a number of good schools for Grace & Stark. There is a gentleman in town who has a boy who has given him & his teacher much trouble & on Saturday he was speaking of Mr. Morgan (who is the teacher to whom I referred for Thomas) & he spoke of him in very high terms for the successful management of his boy & for the progress that his boy is making under his new teacher.
</p><p>
I heard from Anna on Saturday. She hoped to be at Hampden Sidney today. She feels much improved & is bringing Laura her youngest sister home with her. I hope that they will soon be here.
</p><p>
Let me hear from you soon & tell me what Mr. A says. I felt it would be more prudent in me not to say anything in my letter about his moving here. I would like to see him first & thus have a better opportunity of judging how he could best be approached successfully on the subject. I desired to write to you two weeks ago but I thought that Mr. A. might suspect something from the frequency of our letters.
</p><p>
Love to all, and trust God unreservedly in all things is my sincere prayer.
</p><p>
Your affectionate brother, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jjt" rel="me">Thomas</a>.
