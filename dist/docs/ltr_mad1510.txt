DEAR SIR, Be pleased to accept my congratulations on the 
event which has given to your talents a station in which they 
cannot fail to be equally useful to the public and honorable to 
yourself. I offer them with the greater pleasure, too, as such 
an event is a proof that Congress have unfettered themselves 
from a rule which threatened to exclude merit from a choice in 
which merit only ought to prevail.

The assize Bill has, since my last, past into a law. The Senate made no material change in it, but gave an almost unanimous suffrage to it. The only hesitation with them was between 
that plan and another, which would have rendered the circuit 
courts independent of the general court. The former, which 
follows the English model, unites the advantages of a trial of 
facts, where facts can be ascertained with greatest certainty and 
cheapness, with a decision of law, where such decision can be 
made with most wisdom and uniformity. The advantage of the 
latter consisted in removing the inconveniency of making up 
the issues and awarding the judgments in the general court, 
which it was supposed would increase expense, if not delay, and 
particularly require the serv.e of a double number of lawyers. 
Experience will probably shew that the latter supposition is 
exaggerated, and that the system preferred is at least the best 
to begin with.

The general assessment bill was ordered to be engrossed by 
forty-four against forty-two, and has since, by forty-five against 
thirty-seven, been postponed till November next, and is to be 
printed for immediate consideration. An act incorporating the 
Episcopal church has passed in a form less offensive than the 
one proposed at the last Session. The Bill for payment of British debts was under debate yesterday; its passage seems probable, but there is reason to fear that attempts will yet be made 
to trammel it. It still takes seven years for payment, though 
the Glasgow merchants have signified their assent to four years. 
The merchants of this town and Petersburg have remonstrated 
against the idea of giving the British merchants a summary recovery at the periods of the instalments. The Bill for opening 
the Potowmac is suspended on the result of a conference. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">General Washington</a>, General Gates, and Colonel Blackburn, are 
commissioned to hold conferences with Maryland on the subject. A Bill for opening James River, on a different plan, has 
passed the House of Delegates. A Bill will also probably 
pass for surveying the waters of those two rivers to their 
sources, the country between them and the western waters, and 
the latter down to the Ohio. It will also probably provide for 
a survey of the different routes for a communication between 
the waters of Elizabeth River and those of North Carolina.

In the course of last week a proposition was made to empower Congress to collect the Impost within this State [Virginia] as soon as twelve States should unite in the scheme. The 
arguments which prevailed against it were the unfavorable aspect it would present to foreigners; the tendency of the example 
to inferior combinations; the field it would open for contraband 
trade; its probable effect on the temper of Rhode Island, which 
might thwart other necessary measures requiring the unanimity 
of the States; the improbability of the union of twelve States 
on this new ground, a failure of which would increase the appearance of discord in their policy, and give fresh triumph and 
irritation to Rhode Island.

I have not yet found leisure to scan the project of a Continental Convention with so close an eye as to have made up any 
observ.ions worthy of being mentioned to you. In general, I 
hold it for a maxim, that the Union of the States is essential to 
their safety against foreign danger and internal contention; 
and that the perpetuity and efficacy of the present system cannot be confided in. The question therefore is, in what mode 
and at what moment the experiment for supplying the defects 
ought to be made. The answer to this question cannot be given 
without a knowledge greater than I possess of the temper and 
views of the different States. Virginia seems, I think, to have 
excellent dispositions towards the Confederacy, but her assent 
or dissent to such a proposition would probably depend on the 
chance of its having no opponent capable of rousing the prejudices and jealousies of the Assembly against innovations, particularly such as will derogate from their own power and importance. Should a view of the other States present no objections against the experiment, individually, I would wish none 
to be presupposed here.

With great esteem and regard, I am, dear sir, your obt and 
hum. serv.
