Dear Sir,
</p><p>
I have been honoured with your letter, in which you mention to me
your intention of returning to America in the April packet. It is with
sincere concern that I meet this event, as it deprives me not only of
your aid in the office in which we have been joined, but also of your
society, which has been to me a source of the greatest satisfaction.
I think myself bound to return you my thanks for it, and, at the
same time, to bear testimony, that in the discharge of the office of
Secretary of Legation to the several commissions, you have fulfilled all
its duties with readiness, propriety, and fidelity. I sincerely wish,
that on your return, our country may avail itself of your talents in the
public service, and that you may be willing so to employ them. You
carry with you my wishes for your prosperity, and a desire of being
instrumental to it: and I hope, that in every situation in which we may
be placed, you will freely command and count on my services. I will beg
to be favored with your letters, whenever it is convenient. You have
seen our want of intelligence here, and well know the nature of
that which will be useful or agreeable. I fear I shall have little
interesting to give you in return; but such news as my situation
affords, you shall be sure to receive. I pray you to be the bearer of
the enclosed letter to Mr. Jay, to accept my wishes for a favorable
passage, a happy meeting with your friends, and for every future
felicity which this life can afford, being with the greatest esteem,
Dear Sir,
</p><p>
your sincere friend
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
