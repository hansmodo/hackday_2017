Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It may perhaps be proper to mention one or two things, 
in relation to the objects treated of in my letters of last 
January. And first, of a commerce with the French Islands. 
Nothing has, I believe, been done in France, which may be 
favorable to our views ; but the commotions in the Islands 
themselves will, I presume, operate like liberal regulations of 
police, and probably the colonists will eventually demand as a 
right, what some time since they would have accepted as a favor. 
I am led to believe that we should not be over anxious on this 
subject just now, because circumstances will perhaps serve us 
better than we can serve ourselves.

My predictions respecting the Turk have been so far veri 
fied, as that he has got rid of one of his enemies upon tolerable 
terms, for he loses no dominion worth a contest. How far 
the intercessions now making to the Empress of Russia will 
produce the desired effect, seems not to be clearly ascertained. 
If a squadron of Dutch or English ships had arrived in the 
Baltic last May, it is more than probable that the peace of the 
north would have been restored ; but there are many events 
which would enable the Empress of Russia to carry on suc 
cessful operations against both the Turk and the Swede. 
The armies of the former, which opposed those of the Empe 
ror, cannot suddenly be transported to the quarter where they 
are now wanted ; neither will the expense of them cease during the campaign. It appears to me that the season is too 
far advanced for anything Prussia can do, let the inclination of 
the king be what it may ; and Sweden, unprotected by naval 
superiority, is exposed to the land force of its enemy, 
without much chance either of aid or diversion. Finland, 
which will probably be the object of the Czarina, cannot maintain forces needful to defend it, if the sea communication be 
cut off. Therefore the whole Prussian army, could it be 
transported thither, would be worse than useless. And thus 
the withdrawing of Austria from the war will have less influence than might have been expected. 
</p><p>
The people of Flanders seem to be given up, after having 
been used to distress the House of Austria. Heaven knows 
what desperation may prompt them to ; but it appears to me 
</p><p>
that a wise conduct on the part of France would have acquired for her the dominion of that country ; and if ever that 
should happen, France having at the same time a good constitution, the consequence of this island is gone. Antwerp 
seems intended by nature for the emporium of European 
commerce, and the navigation of the Scheldt would undoubtedly be opened if it belonged to a great naval power. That 
river and the Thames being nearly opposite to each other, 
mutual visits might be expected, and in these the superiority 
at land must at length prove decisive. 
</p><p>
The situation of France, however, seems at first sight to 
preclude all effort. The national bank, which was in contemplation, has never taken effect. After deliberating about it and 
about it, the thing dropped, and they expected to have made 
out with their new paper currency (the assignats) but my 
predictions on that subject seem to be verified. Still, how 
ever, the situation of their finances is not desperate. But 
their Assembly is losing ground daily in the public opinion. 
The army, long encouraged in licentious conduct, is now in 
revolt. All the bands of society are loosened, and authority 
is gone. Unless they are soon involved in a foreign war, it is 
impossible to conjecture what events will take place. For 
sometime past the ministers have been threatened with the Lanterne, and they would gladly get out of office. The 
great difficulty is, to find successors, or rather substitutes. 
Lafayette has been contriving an intermediate ministry to last 
for a few months, till, by the dissolution of the assembly, who, 
you know, passed a self-denying ordinance, a set could be taken 
from among the present members of that body. But this will 
prove a bad business ; for if the intermediaries are not able, 
then they will make things worse ; and if they are, they will 
not give up their places. 
</p><p>
We are in hourly expectation of hearing the decision of the 
Assembly upon the family compact. The Spanish Ambassa 
dor has required, in pointed terms, a compliance on the part 
of France. This, I have good reason to believe, was in concert with the French administration. If it were possible to answer for such a body as the Assemblee^ and so placed as they 
are, I would pronounce in favor of their adherence to the terms 
of that compact. If so, the tone o f the British ministy may 
be a little lowered. In the meantime, both the Spanish and 
English fleets are out, and were approaching towards each other. 
Probably each side means only to terrify at present; but Spain 
will not recede any farther, except in the last necessity. 
</p><p>
In a day or two I expect to learn something of their intentions here respecting us ; and if I do not hear from them, I shall 
make a final address to his Grace of Leeds. 
</p><p>
It is very flattering to me, Sir, that you are so kind as to ap 
prove of my communications with the ministers of this country, 
so far as they had gone in the beginning of May. I earnestly 
hope that my subsequent conduct may meet the same favorable interpretation. This you may rely on, that if in any case 
I go wrong, it will be from an error of judgment. I am, &c.
