My dear sir
</p><p>
I will only enclose a short note as Mary has written to you expressing my thanks for your kindness & regretting the trouble that may have devolved upon you in consequence as none of my family can go to Washington at present. My cousin Miss Heather Williams who lived with us at Arlington many years, will leave here on Monday for George Town & will confer with you on the subject of the removal of our property She will also go over to Arlington where she left many articles of her own with full authority from me to take anything she desires to Mrs Kennon is in George Town. We have a faithful woman still at Arlington who was left in charge of the house Selina Grey, who can give more information concerning all that is contained than any one else & who in vain exerted herself to save what was so dear to me from destruction - I am particularly anxious to recover my family Bible & a very old one with clasps. The frames of all my pictures which I left hang (Page 2) ing on the walls of the rooms & which could have been of little value to any one else, a small Mexican saddle mounted with silver left in the garret & a large package sewed up in linen containing very handsome crimson silk brocade curtains & an old fashioned brocade --?-- of my grandmother - all our house silver - I mention these things because Col Taylor was kind enough to say that he would institute some search for things that were missing I shall be very happy to receive the list of what has been left in the & can readily furnish one of what was there if it would be of any avail I write in great haste as I do not want to miss this mail. Can write more fully by Miss Williams if necessary
