Dear Brother : I think I have owed you a letter some 
time. I have nothing new. Days, weeks, and months 
glide by, and my mail brings the most conglomerate stuft 
possible, letters asking for autographs, photographs, 
donations, tokens, such as saddles, swords, muskets, 
buttons, etc., etc., which I used in the war, many letters predicting that I will be the next President, and 
that the writer foresaw it and was the first to conceive 
the thought. ... I notice with satisfaction that my 
name is being gradually dropped, and that my sincerity 
is recognized. What your party wants is a good, fair 
executive, and of these you have plenty, Edmunds, 
Harrison, Gresham, Logan, etc., etc. ... I wish to 
remain absolutely neutral. Gresham has a fine war 
record, and is as honest, outspoken, judicious a man as 
I know among my old soldiers. I also think highly of 
Calkins of Indiana and Ballantine of Nebraska. 
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
