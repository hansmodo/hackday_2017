My Dear Friend : I wrote you last by Chouteau that probably I would soon be at Mazatlan, whence I would write to 
you ; but events so transpired that Colonel Mason did not 
go there, but went to the Sacramento to examine into the 
truth of the rumors that were swelling each day the amount 
of gold found there. I, of course, accompanied him, and 
we had an agreeable tour by way of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san francisco" rel="city">San Francisco</a>. 
There we had our horses, and those of the escort, carried 
to the north side of the Bay of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san francisco" rel="city">San Francisco</a>, to Sousolito or Whaler's Harbor, whence we proceeded to Bodega. 
That is an old Russian port where the fur companies 
had located some families to raise wheat for the colony 
at Sitka, which is in too cold a region to raise wheat. 
The Russian company has broken up in California, and 
Bodega is in the hands of an enterprising American, 
named Smith, who, at great cost, has erected a steam 
saw -mill. It looked strange to see the puffing of an 
engine, and to witness once more its marvellous power. 
It is the only thing of the kind in this region of earth. 
Smith would have made his fortune by sawing lumber 
and grinding wheat, but the gold fever has stripped him 
of all his employees, and he himself was on the point of 
breaking up and going to the mines. From Bodega we 
crossed a range of hills into the valley of the Pataloma, 
which empties into the northwest corner of the Bay of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san francisco" rel="city">San Francisco</a>, and thence to Sonoma, which is on a 
stream of the same name. Each of these valleys are flat 
as a table and bounded by high hills. . . . The Sacramento, where we crossed it at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jas" rel="colleague met">Sutter</a>'s Fort, is a broad 
stream, with a current of two or three miles an hour ; 
the banks are low, so that, when the rainy season sets in, 
the vast plain on the east side is one sheet of water, but 
at ordinary seasons the stream is confined within its 
banks of about three hundred yards wide. We crossed 
ourselves in a boat, but our horses and mules swam the 
river. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jas" rel="colleague met">Sutter</a>'s Fort stands about three miles back from 
the river, and about a mile from the American Forke, 
which also is a respectable stream. The fort encloses a 
space of about two hundred yards by eighty ; the walls 
are built of adobe or sun-dried brick. All the houses are 
of one story, save one, which stands in the middle, which 
is two stories. This is the magazine, officers' mess-room, 
etc. It was in this that in former times <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jas" rel="colleague met">Sutter</a> held his 
state and issued orders amongst the tribes of Indians as 
peremptory and final as those of an emperor. This man 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jas" rel="colleague met">Sutter</a> has played a conspicuous part in the history of 
this country, and is likely to continue his onward career. 
His personal appearance is striking ; about forty or fifty 
years of age, slightly bald, about five feet six inches in 
height, open, frank face, and strongly foreign in his 
manner, appearance, and address. He speaks many languages fluently, including that of all Indians, and has 
more control over the tribes of the Sacramento than any 
man living. We spent many days at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jas" rel="colleague met">Sutter</a>'s, and were 
at the first Fourth of July dinner ever given publicly at 
the fort. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jas" rel="colleague met">Sutter</a> presided at the head of the table, Governor Mason on his right and I on his left. About fifty 
sat down to the table, mostly Americans, some foreigners, 
and one or two Californians. The usual toasts, songs, 
speeches, etc., passed off, and a liberal quantity of liquor 
disposed of, champagne, Madeira, sherry, etc. ; upon the 
whole a dinner that would have done credit in any frontier town. I have no doubt it cost the givers $1500 or 
$2000. At <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jas" rel="colleague met">Sutter</a>'s we began to see the full effect of the 
gold ; rooms in the fort were rented at $100 a month, 
and one indifferent house at $500 a month. A small oxload, hauled some twenty-five miles, cost $60, and a trip 
of the Lancet to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san francisco" rel="city">San Francisco</a> was worth $600. The 
mechanics employed by Sutter got $10 a day the month 
round, and common laborers one dollar an hour. Horses 
that a few months ago were worth $15 and $20 were 
then worth $75 and now $100. From Sutter's we went 
up the American Forke twenty-five miles to the Mormon 
diggings. This is a half-formed island of sand and gravel 
where the Mormons first began to wash for gold. They 
got out a great deal at about the rate of $25 per man a 
day. The gold is in fine bright scales and is very pure. 
It is separated from the earth and gravel by washing in 
the pans by hand, but the better plan is in a kind of 
inclined trough with cleats nailed across the bottom. A 
grate is placed over the highest part of this trough, upon 
which the gravel is thrown, afterwards the water. The 
gold passes into the trough, the gravel and stones are 
removed, and by a constant dashing of water and rocking 
the machine, the earthy matter is washed off, leaving the 
gold mixed with black sand in the bottom of the machine. 
These are separated by drying them in the sun and blowing off the sand, leaving the gold pure. You would be 
astonished at the ease with which the precious metal is 
obtained ; any man by common industry can make $25 a 
day. We visited a great many parties at work as high 
up the American Forke as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jas" rel="colleague met">Sutter</a>'s saw-mill, fifty miles 
above his fort, and there struck to the right and left into 
the mountains. In the bed of the stream the gold is in 
fine scales, whereas in the hollows and ravines it is of 
coarse and of irregular dimensions. I have seen a great 
many pieces as heavy as two or three ounces, one of six 
ounces, and have heard of one of six pounds. In the 
mountain ravine several men have made $8000 or $10,000 
a month. Everybody is at perfect liberty to go where 
he will, but the gold occurs so plentifully that there is 
no quarrelling, no collisions. We saw a great deal of 
gold, and, as near as we could then estimate it, about 
four thousand people were at work getting out about 
$50,000 of gold daily. This gold occurs in the whole 
western slope of the Sierra Nevada north and south of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jas" rel="colleague met">Sutter</a>'s. Exploring parties not satisfied with $25 and 
$50 a day are looking for the pure metal unmixed with 
earth. Gold is so common that it can be bought for $8 
or $9 the oun,ce, and it is worth in Valparaiso qr the 
United States $16 or $18. The sudden development of 
so much wealth has played the devil with the country. 
Everybody has gone there, save women and officers. 
Our soldiers are deserting, and we can't stop it. A 
tailor won't work a day, nor a shoemaker, nor any other 
tradesman, all have gone to the mines. The sailors 
desert their ships as fast as they come on the coast, and 
we have been waiting a month to send an express to the 
United States, but no vessel can get a crew to leave the 
coast. We remained up there among the mountains a 
few days, and saw enough gold to carry conviction of 
the truth of the most exaggerated accounts that had previously reached us. We hurried back to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> to 
despatch a courier to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, but no vessel has yet 
been able to leave the coast for want of a crew. We are 
now hourly expecting a small schooner from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san francisco" rel="city">San Francisco</a>, which is reported about to make an effort with 
three or four men to get to Valparaiso. When we were 
in the midst of despatches about the gold mines and 
mania, here comes the notice of the conclusion of the 
Treaty of Peace, and Great Jehovah, what a treaty ! A 
conquering army, in the country of an enemy, making 
such terms ! No wonder we could not impress the Mexicans with respect for us. Had we burned their capital, 
blown up San Juan d'Alloa, knocked down Mazatlan, 
and gone back to the United States, it would have been 
a better treaty than the present one. If we were at war, 
we should not have made apologies for it by paying 
fifteen millions and imposing on ourselves conditions 
that cannot be fulfilled. Every article of the treaty is 
just such a one as Mexico would have imposed on us 
had she been the conqueror. Mexico did not relinquish 
Lower California. It is many years since she has had 
more than a shadow of an authority here. But I have 
no doubt the treaty will be overhauled thoroughly by 
the papers at home. Peace increases our difficulties 
here tenfold. The Volunteers all have to be discharged, 
and in Upper California will not remain over a hundred 
soldiers at seven dollars per month. Of course, they are 
deserting as fast as they can, and in a very short time 
there will not be a dozen left, and we officers will be 
alone in this country, with heavy magazines and valuable stores unguarded. Peace, too, makes this American 
territory in which the military officers can exercise no 
constitutional authority. So that, at a critical moment, 
all force, civil and military, is withdrawn, and the 
country filled with the hardest kind of a population of 
deserters and foreigners. 
</p><p>
All are now so intent upon getting plenty of gold 
that they cannot think of the danger that envelops us. 
The administration have left Colonel Mason in a tight 
place, with no troops and no civil powers. A government of some kind must exist here soon, or the devil 
will be to pay. Sonoma is the residence of General 
Guadelupa Vallejo, who was the great man of that section at the time of the change of flags. He is far better 
educated than any of his countrymen, lives in some comfort and style, and managed to secure some fifty or one 
hundred leagues of land in the olden time. 
</p><p>
These people don't care a for a man who can't 
enforce his orders by soldiers. Two years ago they revolted at having garrisons in their towns, but now that 
these garrisons are about to be broken up, they beg and 
implore for protection, saying the Indians will ravage 
and destroy, steal their women, the horses and cattle. 
All this is true, but no human power or feeling will 
draw from the mines as heterogeneous a crowd as were 
ever crowded in a small corner of earth's surface. I 
suppose the official documents sent to the adjutantgeneral will be called for by Congress, and will be 
printed. The maps accompanying are the best that 
have yet been compiled. Ord drew the large one, and I 
the small ones. If I have time I'll sketch you a sheet 
to show the position of the Gold District.
