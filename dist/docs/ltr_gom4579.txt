My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I received a few days past your kind letter from Warsaw, 
without date. The enclosures shall be applied as you desire, 
both in this city and in London, to which latter place I expect 
soon to repair. I have delivered your message to the Countess 
de Segur, and desired Mr Short to send the bust, which he has 
promised, and presents his compliments to you.

Mr Jefferson is, you know, departed, with intention to return 
next spring. All the accounts received from our country are 
flattering. Freedom, order, and justice are established. Abundance reigns, and there is every just hope of future prosperity. 
As yet, the government have not turned their attention to naval affairs, which, though perhaps more necessary, are less ur 
gent than many others. I do not think that establishments of 
that kind will take place for two or three years to come. Con 
sequently, any views which you may have directed towards 
that object can be for some time suspended. 
</p><p>
You ask me, my dear friend, to give you my advice. This 
is a task both difficult and delicate. A journey to this city can, 
I think, produce nothing but the expense attending it ; for neither pleasure nor advantage can be expected here, by one of 
your profession in particular ; and, except that it is a more dangerous residence than many others, I know of nothing which 
may serve to you as an inducement.

Whether the Turk will be able to make battle for another 
campaign seems to be considered as uncertain. But from the 
troubles in Brabant, and from the necessity of supporting Sweden through the contest she has been led to engage in, I conclude that peace will not take place this winter ; and if not, the 
Baltic will witness some warm work next year. The cabinet 
of St Petersburg must know what can be depended on before 
the first day of January next, and as it is possible that Sweden 
will get help, (perhaps from Holland,) everything must depend 
on striking early. Hence t conclude, that the ball will be opened in April next, and if you can devise any good plan, it will be 
well to communicate it to the Empress early. I am not sufficiently master of facts to give hints, but I should suppose that 
a manoeuvre towards the mouth of the Baltic, so as to cover 
any assistance that Denmark may feel inclined to give, and pre 
vent the junction of any aid sent from the southward, might be 
no unwise procedure.

I am, &tc.
