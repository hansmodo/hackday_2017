DEAR FRIEND, Thinking it may be acceptable I put pen to paper to write thee 
a few lines, in part to inform thee of the manner in which we got along and my safe 
return home. The kind reception we met with when at thy dwelling has caused my 
mind to be much with thee and thine. Since WQ parted from thee particularly so, 
dear Dorothy, for several days after, when at a clear, flowing brook, with the help of 
thy kindness, we poor pilgrims were refreshed on the way, which seemed to satisfy as a sit meal at a full spread table ; and 
though we were strangers in a strange land, yet at times were enabled to rejoice 
that the Lord had counted us worthy to suffer shame for his sake. We were favored to get along very well, and arrived 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> the day preceding the yearly meeting, where I received a letter from 
home, and was informed that my dear babe was ill and by account could not expect to recover. 
</p><p>
The next day after this news my beloved companion, Sarah Scull, was taken sick. 
This centred my mind in deep humility before the Lord, and thankful of my own 
health, desirous that every trying dispensation may be prosperous in their errand to 
me, I endeavored to resign my will to the Divine will, and parting with my companion 
in good hands at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, set out for home, where through the protection of Divine mercy I found my husband and children in good health, and my dear babe recovered of her sickness. And now, my 
dear friend, having visited thy dwelling 
much bowed down in mind under a sense of my weakness, having none but the Lord to appeal to, to justify me in my 
visit, to relieve my mind of much that was on it. Dear friend, thou hast a precious 
talent committed to thy trust by the King of kings, and my soul s desire for thee is 
that thou may more and more come out of all that cumbers the earth, and redeem 
thy soul from all difficulties that do or may attend it. My wishes for thee and 
thine is that thou may be supported under every exercise of mind, and witness the 
living presence of Jesus Christ, to war against vanity, pleasure, ambition, and avarice, and to put from thee all the fading 
pleasures of this world, but rather prize the crown immortal that fadeth not away. 
Assuredly, dear Dorothy, I think I shall ever remember thee with gratitude of 
heart, thee and thy beloved companion, your kind and Christian entertainment of 
us ; God will not be wanting to reward your love. Desirous to be had in remembrance by thee, dear Dorothy, in love, I 
conclude, and remain thy soul s best wisher,
