<p>
TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY 
</p><p>
[ALEXANDER HAMILTON] 
</p><p>
THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, February 2d, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR : 
</p><p>
On the 5th of December last I had the honor of writing 
you relative to the loan of 800,000 dollars, which has been 
proposed, and to the interest due and not paid upon the 
Antwerp loan. 
</p><p>
Since that time a total revolution has taken place in the 
political state of this country, but hitherto without operat 
ing any change of circumstances favorable to the success 
of the intended loan. The shyness and timidity of wealth 
are not yet removed, and the numerous recent deficiencies 
of payments at once diminish the usual quantity of superfluous money, and shake the confidence of individuals in all 
public engagements. 
</p><p>
The interest due upon the loans of the Emperor of Russia, 
of Poland, of Sweden and of the Dutch East India Company 
are all suspended. The province of Holland itself is more 
than insolvent, and the only securities which have not considerably depreciated are those of the United States. 
</p><p>
The advices from Lisbon upon which at all events the 
opening of the loan is to depend, have not been received. 
The bankers have repeatedly urged to me, and they have also 
written to you, Sir, their opinion of the expediency of an 
unconditional authority to take advantage of any favorable 
opportunity which may present itself. They say that from 
the nature of these transactions an occasion frequently 
occurs, which opens for a few days an avenue to the object 
which is totally barred before and afterwards. 
</p><p>
They have written to Hamburg to make inquiries whether 
the loan could be made there, in case it should continue to 
be impracticable in this country. They have received 
orders to transmit money for the payment of the interest 
due upon the Antwerp loan, orders which it has hitherto 
been impossible for them to execute. At the time when the 
interest became due the communication between <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> and Antwerp was interrupted, and a prohibition of the 
government here prevented the remittance. The inter 
course is now perfectly free, but Mr. de Wolf's compting house is shut up, and I have been told that he is himself 
detained as an hostage to secure the payment of a contribution imposed upon the city of Antwerp. 
</p><p>
Should he be speedily liberated and his compting house 
again opened, the holders of the Brabant obligations who 
arc already impatient and uneasy will become clamorous 
unless they are immediately paid, and the delay, which I 
fear will then be inevitable, must have some temporary 
effect upon our credit. 
</p><p>
Whether this delay in the case supposed shall be unavoidable or not, must depend upon the capacity and disposition of Mr. de Wolf to advance the money, for I confess 
I have little expectation that it will be remitted from hence. 
</p><p>
In a conversation which I had a few days since with Air. 
William Willink and Mr. Hubbard they informed me, that 
when their payments of this month and of March shall be 
made, they shall be in advance with the Treasury Depart 
ment. And the former of these gentlemen intimated that 
in case Mr. de Wolf should be liberated, the obligation of 
making advances upon his loan was incumbent upon him, 
as those upon their loans would be a sufficient burden upon them. 
</p><p>
This circumstance is mentioned in order to warrant an 
observation which becomes indispensable. It is, that no exertions beyond what a sense of duty prescribes are to be expected from the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> gentlemen to secure the fulfillment of our stipulations in the contract made at Antwerp. 
</p><p>
It was also hinted that even in case there should be funds 
in possession at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> sufficient for the remittance, the 
possibility of an appropriation to other than the intended 
purposes of the money after its reception at Antwerp ought 
to be considered. 
</p><p>
The character of the house at Antwerp is altogether un 
known to me. The suspicion discovered on this occasion 
may, perhaps without injustice, be attributed in part to 
motives more immediately concerning the interest of the 
gentlemen at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> than those of the United States. 
But in the revolutions of property and of principles which 
have become so frequent at this time, the inconvenience 
and danger of multiplying great pecuniary trusts cannot 
escape observation. 
</p><p>
These trusts are necessarily so great, and at the same time 
accompanied with so little real responsibility, that it is to 
be wished the United States may seldom have occasion in 
future of recurring to the resource of European loans. 
</p><p>
When payments of the principal are made a certain 
number of specific obligations are usually called in and 
cancelled. An instance has lately occurred in which the 
bankers who had negotiated a loan for the Danish government, instead of cancelling the obligations they had paid 
off, issued them into circulation again, and by this infidelity 
have loaded their employers with a double payment of the 
same debt. 
</p><p>
The Emperor's bankers towards the close of the last 
year, advertised in the public papers that the interest pay 
able on the then ensuing new year's day would be paid as 
usual. By a subsequent advertisement they gave notice 
that the payments would be suspended for want of remittances. In the interval between the two publications they 
are said to have sold out all the obligations upon the loan 
held by themselves. 
</p><p>
The Swedish bankers at Antwerp have paid the interests 
due since the arrival of the French in that city in assignats, 
whether by order of their government or otherwise, I am 
unable to say. In either case the creditors are without 
remedy. In the latter the Swedish government is in the 
same situation. 
</p><p>
The bankers of the United States at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> are 
men of so much integrity that nothing is to be apprehended 
from their transactions disgraceful to themselves, or deroga 
tory to the honor of their employers. But the confidence 
which is safe in their hands, cannot with equal security be 
entrusted to a variety of commercial houses in different 
parts of Europe, among foreigners not amenable to our 
jurisdictions, and subject to no other control than their 
individual fidelity. 
</p><p>
Upon this occasion it may be proper to suggest to consideration the propriety of some arrangements to ensure the 
payments of interest upon the Antwerp loan in future, 
independent of any gratuitous exertions at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>. 
Great confidence maybe reposed in the dispositions of those 
gentlemen to maintain the credit of the United States in 
their own city, and they will not hesitate in case of necessity 
to anticipate from their own chest a payment of interest, 
rather than suffer a failure of punctuality in the performance 
of stipulations contracted by their agency. The credit of 
</p><p>
the United States at Antwerp they do not conceive to be so 
much within their department, nor of primary importance. 
It has nothing to expect from them but neutrality. I have 
the honor, etc.
