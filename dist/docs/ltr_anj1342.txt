</p><p>
SIR: Your letter of the 19th July, apprizing me of the course to be pursued 
in relation to the Floridas, has been received. In a future communication 
it is my intention to submit my views of all the questions springing from 
the subject, with the fulness and candor which the importance of the topic, 
and the part I have acted in it, demand. At present, I will confine myself 
to the consideration of a part of your letter, which has a particular bearing on myself, and which sterns to have originated in a misconception of the 
import of the order under which I have commenced the Seminole campaign. 
In making this examination, I will make use of all the freedom which is 
courted by your letter, and which I deem necessary to afford you a clear 
view of the construction which was given to the order, and the motives 
under which I proceeded to execute its intentions. 
</p><p>
It is stated in the second paragraph of your letter, that I transcended the 
limits of my order, and that I acted on my own responsibility. 
</p><p>
To these two points I mean at present to confine myself. But, before 
entering on a proof of their applicability to my acts in Florida, allow me 
fairly to state, that the assumption of responsibility will never be shrunk 
from when the public can thereby be promoted. I have passed through 
difficulties and exposures for the honor and benefit of my country; and 
whenever still, for this purpose, it shall become necessary to assume a further liability, no scruple will be urged or felt. But when it shall be required of me to do so, and the result be danger and injury to that country, the inducement will be lost, and my consent will be wanting. 
</p><p>
This principle is held to be incontrovertible, that an order, generally, to 
perform a certain service, or effect a certain object, without any specification 
of the means to be adopted, or limits to govern the executive officer, leaves 
an entire discretion with the officer as to the choice and application of 
means, but preserves the responsibility for his acts on the authority from 
which the order emanated. Under such an order all the acts of the inferior 
are acts of the superior; and in no way can the subordinate officer be impeached for his measures, except on the score of deficiency in judgment and 
skill. It is also a grammatical truth, that the limits of such an order cannot 
be transcended without an entire desertion of the objects it contemplated; 
for as long as the mam legitimate design is kept in view, the policy of the 
measures adopted to accomplish it is alone to be considered. If these be 
adopted as the proper rules of construction, and we apply them to my order of December 26, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1817">1817</a>, it will be at once seen, that, both in description and operative principle, they embrace that order excatly. 
The requisitions of the order are for the commanding general to assume the immediate command at fort Scott, to concentrate all the contiguous and disposable 
force of the division on that quarter, to call on the executives of adjacent 
States for an auxiliary militia force, and concludes with this comprehensive 
command: (: With this view you may be prepared to concentrate your 
forces, and adopt the necessary measures to terminate a conflict, which it 
has ever been the desire of the President, from motives of humanity, to 
avoid, but which is now made necessary by their settled hostility." 
</p><p>
In no part of this document is there a reference to any previous order, 
either to myself or another officer, with a view to point to me the measures 
thought advisable, or the limits of my power in choosing and effecting them. 
It states that Gen. Gaines has been ordered to Amelia island, and then 
proceeds to inform me that " subsequent orders have been given to General 
Gaines, (of which copies will be furnished you,) that you would be directed 
to take the command, and directing him to re-assume, should he deem the 
public interest to require it the command at fort Scott, until you should 
arrive there." Lastly, it mentions that he was instructed to penetrate the 
Seminole towns through the Floridas, provided the strength of his command at Amelia would justify his engaging in offensive operations. The 
principle determining the weignt of references, in subsequent orders, to 
instructions previously given, is well settled. Such references are usually 
made with one of these two intentions either the order is given to a second officer, to effect a certain purpose which was intended to be effected by 
another officer, and the instructions of the first are referred to as the guide 
of the second; or the order contains and is designed for an extension of authority, and only refers to anterior communications to give a full view of 
what has been previously attempted and performed. In the first case it is 
always necessary to connect the different orders by a specific provision, 
that no doubt may exist as to the extent of the command; and thus the 
several requisitions and instructions are amalgamated, and the limits of the 
agent plainly and securely established. In the second, no such provision is 
necessary; for an entire discretion in the choice and use of means being 
previously vested, the reference, if there be any, is only descriptive of the 
powers antecedently given, and the results of measures attempted under 
such specifical limitation. But admitting, that, in my order of December 26, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1817">1817</a>, there is such a reference as I contemplated in the first case, allow 
me to examine its character and amount It is stated that "orders have 
been given to General Gaines, (copies of which will be furnished you,)" but 
without affirming that they are to be considered as binding on me, or in any 
way connected with the comprehensive command that I should terminate 
the Seminole conflict. On the contrary, so far are they from being designated as my guide and limits in entering Florida, that, in stating their substance in the ensuing sentence, no allusion whatever is made either to means 
or limitation. 
</p><p>
How, then, can it be said with propriety that I have transcended the 
limits of my orders, or acted on my own responsibility? My order was 
as comprehensive as it could be, and contained neither the minute original 
instructions, or a reference to others previously given, to guide and govern 
me. The fullest discretion was left with me in the selection and application 
of means to effect the specifical legitimate objects of the campaign; and for 
the exercise of a sound discretion on principles of policy am I alone responsible. But allow me to repeat, that responsibility is not feared by me, if 
the general good requires its assumption. I never have shrunk from it, and never will; but against its imposition on me contrary to principle, 
without the prospect of any politic result, I must contend with all the feelings of a soldier and a citizen. Being advised that you are at your country 
seat in Loudoun, where I expect this will reach you, I enclose you a copy of 
the order to me of the 26th December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1817">1817<a/>, and copies of the orders to 
General Gaines therein referred to; from a perusal of which you will perceive that the order to me has no reference to those prohibitory orders to 
General Gaines that you have referred to. 
</p><p>
It will afford me pleasure to aid the Government in procuring any testimony that may be necessary to prove the hostility of the officers of Spain to 
the United States. I had Supposed that the evidence furnished had established that fact- that the officers of Spain had identified themselves with 
our enemy, and that St. Mark's and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pensacola" rel="city">Pensacola</a> were undier the complete control of the Indians, although- the Governor of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pensacola" rel="city">Pensacola</a> at least had force 
sufficient to have controlled the Indians, had he chosen to have Used it in that 
way. For the purpose of procuring the necessary evidence of the hostile 
acts of the Governor of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pensacola" rel="city">Pensacola</a>, I despatched Captain Young, topographical 
engineer, and as soon as obtained will be furnished you. I trust, on a view 
of all my commimrcations, (copies of which have been forwarded by Capt. 
Gadsden,) you will find that they do not bear the construction you have 
given them. They Were written under bad health, great fatigue, and in 
Haste. My bad health continues: I labor under great bodily debility.

Accept assurances of my sincere regard and esteem; and am, respectfully

Your most obedient servant,
