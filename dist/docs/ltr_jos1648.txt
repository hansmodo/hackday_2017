My Dear Brother: Yours of the 12th instant was 
received when I was very busy, and therefore I did not 
answer in time for you at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lancaster" rel="city">Lancaster</a>. I sent Gales and 
Seaton the six dollars for the paper.

Your estimate of the relative positions of Speaker and 
Chairman of Ways and Means Committee is not accurate. 
The former is worth struggling for ; it is high in dignity, 
influence, and when its duties are well performed it is 
an admirable place to gain reputation. I confess I had 
set my heart upon it and that I could have discharged 
its duties. . . . My present position is a thankless, 
laborious one. I am not adapted to it. It requires too 
much detailed labor and keeps me in constant conflict ; 
it is the place of a schoolmaster with plenty of big boys 
to coax and master. I will get along the best I can. . . . 
You need not fear my caution about extreme views. It 
is my purpose to express my political views in the State 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> in April, and to avoid hasty expressions, I 
will write it out in full for publication. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours,
