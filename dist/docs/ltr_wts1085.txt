My Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
The examination is just over ; the result is favorable 
toward me, as usual. In Engineering I am fourth in my 
class, in Geology and Rhetoric and Moral Philosophy 
each sixth; as to demerits I have also a respectable 
number, about one hundred. The studies and exercises 
will be for the remainder of the academic year exclusively military and important, and will engage us sufficiently to make the time pass pleasantly and rapidly. 
You may well suppose that we are all anxious for the 
arrival of June; the thoughts of graduation, the freedom from academic labors and restraints, already engross 
our minds and form the subjects of all our conversations 
and talks. Already have we given directions for a class 
ring, for graduating trunks, for swords, epaulettes, hats, 
chapeaux, and feathers, and in a couple of months the 
military tailor will be here from the city to take our 
measures for uniform dress and undress coats, cit's 
clothes, pants, etc., etc. Thus you see that by adding 
things of this nature, which will constantly keep the 
future before our minds, we break in upon and enliven 
our otherwise monotonous life.

What have you been doing all winter? Studying, or 
nothing? I am beginning to think that engineering is 
not the thing it is cracked up to be. It does not give 
constant employment to the engineer, who cannot, therefore, rely upon a sure and constant reward for his labors. 
His duties, whilst engaged, are exceedingly laborious and 
irksome, or of the other equally disagreeable extreme; 
beside these, the prosecution of the different improvements depends upon the States within which they lie, 
and there is but little doubt that the policy of most of 
the State governments will soon change in reference to 
their internal works, to paying more and borrowing less, 
and allow the improvements to grow with their wealth 
and population. By examining the public records you 
will see that the State debts are truly enormous, and if 
they attempt to pay them, they will undoubtedly stop 
all expenditures which are not absolutely necessary. I 
noticed in yesterday's paper that the governor of Pennsylvania vetoed six or seven bills granting money for different purposes, and returned them to the Legislature, 
assigning as a reason the absolute necessity of paying 
the debts. I have mentioned these things to you that 
you may reflect, while there is still time, of the propriety 
of selecting means to be resorted to in case of necessity. 
What more naturally suggests itself than a farm ? Who 
can be more independent, more honest and honorable, 
who more sure of a full reward for his labor, who can 
bestow more benefits on his fellow-beings, and consequently be more happy, than an American farmer ? If 
by any meaus you may be able to get some land in Ohio, 
Iowa, or Wisconsin, you should do so by all means, and 
more especially if it is partially improved. I do not 
mean for the purpose of speculation, but to make use of 
yourself. 
</p><p>
Give my love to all the family, and oblige me by 
writing soon. 
</p><p>
Your affectionate brother,
