Day before yesterday we left our fort in command 
of Major Brown and garrisoned by the Seventh In 
fantry and two companies of artillery with eight 
pieces. We started at three in the afternoon and 
marched eight miles through the chaparral by sunset 
and arrived here, thirty miles, after a terrible forced 
march, before noon yesterday. Before reveille this 
morning we heard the guns from our fort near Mata- 
moras, which has undoubtedly been attacked. It is 
now ten in the morning and we still hear the cannon. 
What will be the result no one can conjecture, for in 
truth we know little in regard to the forces of the 
enemy, their numbers being variously reported from 
five to fifteen thousand. Probably it does not exceed 
six thousand. We are to march from here at one 
o clock today to the rescue, as we suppose, of our little 
command before <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a>. We are about two 
thousand strong and may be interrupted in our march.
