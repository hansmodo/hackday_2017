My Dear Old Friend:--I am again engaged filling up a letter to you. I am "Old Dad," still unchanged and unchangeable.

The National Guards had a grand encampment at Paoli. They were on the ground four days. Some ten companies were in attendance. Some wild scenes were enacted on the ground on Friday night, which could probably be beaten only in California. A lot of lewd girls were on the ground, and did a lively business. The "Pennsylvania Protectors" were there.

I am sorry for poor Clint. If he must come home, and if it is necessary for you to make up money to send him, his friends at home will make up the amount to pay you back. It is not fair that he should be so much of a burden upon you. I told some of his friends that you said Clint was sick and you thought he ought to come home, but did not tell them that you had, or would have, funds to send him, fearful that they would make no effort to pay you. You have certainly acted very generously towards him, in attending to his wants while he was sick. I rejoice to find in you so much devotion to a companion.

When you bid West Chester farewell I was then going it strongly with Cad. Now we look upon each other as strangers. I never intended to marry her, and I am glad that I have escaped from the difficulty as I have. I would like to have a wife. It would be so
comfortable. But I am afraid the luxury would be too expensive for me just now.

California appeared to be a bone of contention among members of Congress. I suppose you in California watched the proceedings in relation to your State with great interest. It is at last one of the states of the Union.
</p><p>
The last mail from California brought a paper in your handwriting, printed at Sonora on the 4th of July. I presume you are at that place now. Where is it?
</p><p>
Yours truly, farewell,
</p><p>
