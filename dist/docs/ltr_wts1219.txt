HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a>, Mo. , March 10, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1876">1876</a>.

Dear Brother : I have purposely refrained from writing to you my opinions and feelings on the terrible fate 
that so suddenly has befallen General Belknap, because 
I want to say truthfully that I have never asked you to 
advocate my cause or to be compromised by my mistakes. I am proud of your position in the Senate, and 
would not have you to risk it by even the faintest partiality to your brother. But people will ask you what 
was the real reason why I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>; did I have 
knowledge of frauds and peculations? and was I not 
bound to reveal them? You may answer positively that 
I had no knowledge except what Congress and the President had. It was not my office to probe after vague 
rumors and whispers that had no official basis. The 
President and Belknap both gradually withdrew from 
me all the powers which Grant had exercised in the 
same office, and Congress capped the climax by repealing that law which required all orders to the army to go 
through the General, and the only other one, a joint resolution that empowered the General to appoint "traders." 
</p><p>
The consequence was that orders to individuals of the 
army went over my head to them, and reports went back 
without coming through me, as required in every military service on earth. . . . 
</p><p>
I have now from Moulton two letters, and from Dayton one. In all which is stated that the new Secretary, 
Judge Taft, has spoken kindly of me, and expressed a 
desire to meet me in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. I will not go to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> unless ordered, and it would be an outrage 
if Congress, under a temporary excitement, should compel my removal back. I came out at my own expense, 
and never charged a cent for transportation, which I 
could have done. I can better command the army from 
here than from there. The causes that made a Belknap 
remain and will remain. . . . 
</p><p>
If you see Judge Taft, say to him that my opinion is 
that I can fulfil any general policy he may prescribe, and 
enforce any orders he may give better from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a> 
than <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. 
</p><p>
Affectionately, etc., 
</p><p>
