I -- I am disgusted with myself. No unusual 
thing, but I am peculiarly disgusted this time. Last 
evening, I went to Mrs. Brunot's, without an idea 
of going beyond, with my flag flying again. They 
were all going to the State House, so I went with 
them; to my great distress, some fifteen or twenty 
Federal officers were standing on the first terrace, 
stared at like wild beasts by the curious crowd. I had 
not expected to meet them, and felt a painful conviction that I was unnecessarily attracting attention, 
by an unladylike display of defiance, from the crowd 
gathered there. But what was I to do? I felt humiliated, conspicuous, everything that is painful and 
disagreeable; but strike my colors in the face of 
the enemy? Never! Nettie and Sophie had them, 
too, but that was no consolation for the shame I 
suffered by such a display so totally distasteful to 
me. How I wished myself away, and chafed at my 
folly, and hated myself for being there, and every 
one for seeing me. I hope it will be a lesson to me 
always to remember a lady can gain nothing by 
such display.

I was not ashamed of the flag of my country, 
I proved that by never attempting to remove it in 
spite of my mortification, but I was ashamed of 
my position ; for these are evidently gentlemen, not 
the Billy Wilson's crew we were threatened with. 
Fine, noble-looking men they were, showing refinement and gentlemanly bearing in every motion. One 
cannot help but admire such foes! They set us an 
example worthy of our imitation, and one we would 
be benefited by following. They come as visitors 
without either pretensions to superiority, or the insolence of conquerors; they walk quietly their way, 
offering no annoyance to the citizens, though they 
themselves are stared at most unmercifully, and pursued by crowds of ragged little boys, while even 
men gape at them with open mouths. They prove 
themselves gentlemen, while many of our citizens 
have proved themselves boors, and I admire them 
for their conduct. With a conviction that I had al 
lowed myself to be influenced by bigoted, narrow-minded people, in believing them to be unworthy of 
respect or regard, I came home wonderfully changed 
in all my newly acquired sentiments, resolved never 
more to wound their feelings, who were so careful 
of ours, by such unnecessary display. And I hung 
my flag on the parlor mantel, there to wave, if it 
will, in the shades of private life ; but to make a show, 
make me conspicuous and ill at ease, as I was yesterday, never again !

There was a dozen officers in church this morning, 
and the psalms for the nth day seemed so singularly 
appropriate to the feelings of the people, that I felt 
uncomfortable for them. They answered with us, 
though.
