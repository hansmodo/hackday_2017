There are no negro sexual relations half so shocking as Mormonism. And yet the United States Government makes 
no bones of receiving Mormons into its sacred heart. Mr. Venable said England held her hand over " the malignant 
and the turbaned Turk " to save and protect him, slaves, seraglio, and all. But she rolls up the whites of her eyes 
at us when slavery, bad as it is, is stepping out into freedom every moment through Christian civilization. They do not 
grudge the Turk even his bag and Bosphorus privileges. To a recalcitrant wife it is, " Here yawns the sack; there 
rolls the sea," etc. And France, the bold, the brave, the ever free, she has not been so tender- footed in Algiers. But 
then the ll you are another " argument is a shabby one. " You see," says Mary Preston sagaciously, " we are white 
Christian descendants of Huguenots and Cavaliers, and they expect of us different conduct."

Went in Mrs. Preston's landau to bring my boardingschool girls here to dine. At my door met J. F., who wanted 
me then and there to promise to help him with his commission or put him in the way of one. At the carriage steps I 
was handed in by Gus Smith, who wants his brother made commissary. The beauty of it all is they think I have some 
influence, and I have not a particle. The subject of Mr. Chesnut's military affairs, promotions, etc., is never mentioned by me.
