I am made exceedingly happy by the receipt of 
your friendly letter of the 10th instant, which is this 
moment come to hand ; and the young gentleman 
that brought it, a son of Colonel George Morgan, 
waits while I write this. It had been sent to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and on my not being there, was returned, 
agreeably to directions on the outside, to Colonel Morgan at <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a>, who forwarded it to this place. 
I most sincerely thank you for your good wishes and 
friendship to me, and the kind invitation you have 
honored me with, which I shall with much pleasure 
accept. 
</p><p>
On the resignation of <a href='/results.php?tla=rol' rel='colleague friend'>Mr. Livingston</a> in the winter, and likewise of <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Robert Morris</a> , it 
was judged proper to discontinue the matter which took place when you were in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. It was 
at the same time a pleasure to me to find both these gentlemen (to whom I was, before that time, but little known), so warmly disposed to assist in 
rendering my situation permanent; and <a href='/results.php?tla=rol' rel='colleague friend'>Mr. Livingston's</a> letter to me, in answer to one of mine to him, 
which I inclose, will serve to show that his friendship to me is in concurrence with yours. 
</p><p>
By the advice of <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Morris</a>, I presented a letter 
to Congress expressing a request that they would be 
pleased to direct me to lay before them an account 
of what my services, such as they were, and situation, had been during the course of the war. This 
letter was referred to a Committee, and their report 
is now before Congress, and contains, as I am informed, a recommendation that I be appointed Historiographer to the Continent. I have desired some members, that the further consideration of it be postponed, 
until I can state to the Committee some matters 
which I wish them to be acquainted with, both with 
regard to myself and the appointment. And as it 
was my intention, so I am now encouraged by your 
friendship, to take your confidential advice upon it 
before I present it. For, though I never was at a 
loss in writing on public matters, I feel exceedingly 
so in what respects myself 
</p><p>
I am hurt by the neglect of the collective, ostensible body of America, in a way in which it is probable they do not perceive my feelings. It has an effect in putting either my reputation, or their generosity, at stake ; for it cannot fail of suggesting that 
either I (notwithstanding the appearance of service) 
have been undeserving their regard, or that they are 
remiss towards me. Their silence is to me something like condemnation, and their neglect must be justified 
by my loss of reputation, or my reputation supported 
at their injury ; either of which is alike painful to 
me. But, as I have ever been dumb on every thing 
which might touch national honor, so I mean ever to 
continue so. Wishing you. Sir, the happy enjoyment 
of peace, and every public and private felicity, I remain, your Excellency's

Most obliged and obedient, humble servant,
