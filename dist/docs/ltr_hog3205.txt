SIR, 
</p><p>
In obedience to the orders contained in your Excellency's letters of the 1st and 2d instant, I marched the whole of the Continental troops from the 
State of Rhode Island, and arrived yesterday morning, with the first division, consisting of a detachment of Colonel Crane's artillery, with two six-pounders, Colonel Livington's, Colonel Jackson's, and Colonel Webb's regiments, at <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>. The second division, 
consisting of the rest of Colonel Crane's, with the 
like artillery, <a href='/results.php?tla=chg' rel=''>Colonel Greene</a>'s, Colonel Angell's, and 
Colonel Sherburne's regiments, will be here this evening. As I find no orders here, and have not received 
any letter from your Excellency since that dated the 
2d instant, I shall encamp the troops, and wait your further commands. I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
