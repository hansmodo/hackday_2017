We crossed the Equator Sunday afternoon, January 6th, in longitude 110 deg. 18[min] W. It was cloudy and much cooler. Until yesterday, since leaving Valparaiso, we have been favored with the southeast Trade Wind which carried us some 3,600 miles northwest, but yesterday we had the wind from every quarter with intervals of perfect calmness, and a half dozen heavy showers. Today we were becalmed under a burning sun until about four o'clock P.M., when a fair wind from the northeast sprung up, and since then we have been moving gently forward. This is supposed to be the regular northeast Trade and we
congratulate ourselves on the good luck we have had in thus meeting this wind without waiting for it.

While lying in the harbor in Valparaiso we were almost devoured by fleas, but we were not troubled long after we left. Since then a new scourge has been sent to trouble us. For a few weeks past some have been unable to sleep on account of something biting and creeping over them. Upon search they found their bunks to be infested with bedbugs of monstrous growth and in great numbers, and now almost every one is trying his own expedients to get rid of these troublesome customers. Some oil them and others burn them.

Mr. Sterling has made his first appearance on deck since the fracas between him and Murphy. Mr. and Mrs. H. have again become, in a measure, reconciled with each other and now room together. It is hoped that there may be no further occasion of brawls between them.

This afternoon some of the passengers had a great deal of sport at "Jeremiah's" expense. He had washed out a shirt and hung it in a convenient place to dry, and some one out of mere wantonness and for the joke, took it away and hung it near the top of the mast in such a position that he could not get it. As a consequence he became very wrathy, but after they had plagued him awhile, he got in a better humor and some one promised to get it for him tomorrow.

The vessel now presents a pretty fair appearance, as the seamen have been engaged in painting the rigging and masts. For a long time past, cards had become quite unpopular, but they are again coming in vogue and this evening two or three sets are "at it." Also we had several tunes on the violin and "Murph"
favored us with a series of nigger steps that we christened "The North Carolina War Dance." Last evening we had considerable sport by having a mock auction of the goods and chattels of Section No. 2.

To the north and south now hang dark heavy clouds, and ever and anon vivid flashes of lightning glare along the horizon, lighting up the surrounding darkness.
