DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor to inclose your Excellency 
a letter to Congress, under flying seal. The variety 
of affairs, which claim my attention, does not permit 
me time to communicate to your Excellency and 
Congress, separately, such information as it may be 
necessary both should know. You will, therefore, 
please to excuse the mode I take. 
</p><p>
Our numbers are so few to the northward, and we 
have so little prospect of their increasing, that should 
a disaster befall us at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, we should have 
very few troops indeed to oppose them. If the enemy should make an attempt to penetrate into the 
country, I shall probably be under the necessity of 
calling for assistance from <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. Perhaps your 
Excellency may think proper to lodge an order with 
the commanding officer to comply with my requisition, 
if I should make one, ascertaining the number you 
may think proper to spare. Be assured that I shall 
not ask any aid, as long as there is a possibility of 
doing without. 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 11th of May, to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a>, 
was this day delivered to me by Brigadier-General 
Learned. The clothing for Colonel Shepherd's regiment, if at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, will be immediately sent 
down. I am, dear Sir, with the sincerest esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
