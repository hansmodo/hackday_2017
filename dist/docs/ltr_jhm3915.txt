SIR: 
</p><p>
I received your letter of the 16th late last evening. The officers of 
Col. Maham's corps seem to imitate the principle upon which the incorporation is founded. They appear to imagine it to be an admission of 
Major Conyer's corps into Col. Maham s; but this is not the case. 
There is a material difference between drafting one regiment into 
another, and consolidating two regiments into one. In the first in 
stance, the drafted regiment is either disbanded altogether, or the 
officers sent out to recruit; in the second, there is an indiscriminate 
mixture of men, without giving a superiority in either one or the other, 
and the officers are commonly retained according to their rank; but 
sometimes the arbitrary rule of retaining them, according to their merit, 
has been adopted from this state of the case. The objection that Conyers is disliked by Maham and some of his officers, is frivolous, because Conyers can with equal propriety make the same objection to Maham 
and his officers; and these gentlemen deceive themselves very much 
when they set up a claim of superiority, for they have no manner of 
pretension to it, for the reasons I have given ; and as to the abilities of 
Major Conyers, I believe, sir, you are no stranger to them, and that 
they entitle him to a claim equal to most officers; his merit stands confessed by every impartial man who knows him. If, after these considerations, gentlemen will suffer themselves to be guided by private 
pique, and rather resign their commissions than submit to the established rules of propriety and justice, why, they must do so, and we 
must endeavor to find men that will engage in the service from a pure, 
ardent zeal to love their country. Such will be less governed by pas 
sions, when they can t have their own humour gratified. I send you an 
extract of the minutes of the Council, from which time the commissions 
of Conyers and his officers are to bear date. It is true the corps was 
ordered by Gov. Rutledge to be raised in September; but, as it was 
afterwards rejected by the Legislature, the whole of that arrangement 
was done away, and can only be considered as commencing from the 
re-establishment by me after I came into office. On consulting <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>, I find Maham's must be considered as a State corps, on Continental pay. I should be very glad to be furnished with a return of Maham's and Conyer's corps as soon as you can procure it with accuracy. 
</p><p>
I am very sorry to hear of poor (rough's fate; but it is astonishing to 
me that gentlemen will venture themselves in that part of the country, 
when they see we cannot afford protection to it, and that it is a nest for 
a great part of the devils in the British service. I have sent you an 
order for 100 stand of arms. I have some faint idea that there is 
some medicine at Richardson s, on the high hills of Santee. When 
you send for the arms, pray enquire if there is no one there. I know 
of no mode of getting them but from <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> ; I, therefore, enclose 
you a letter to Heriot and Tucker, desiring them to endeavor to procure 
you a supply agreeably to such list as you may send them. The Continental hospitals here are but scantily supplied at present. Your 
presence is very much wanted in this quarter; indeed, every day renders 
it more and more necessary. I enclose you two brevets for Messrs. Huggins and Rothmahler, agreeably to your request, and have left the 
name blank. <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> was completely evacuated on the llth instant. 
Wayne, who is usually very sanguine, supposed, upon the commencement of the evacuation, it would have been pushed forward with great 
rapidity, and this led me to say to you that it was evacuated; indeed, it would have been so in three days, were it not for the Tories, and 
their negroes, whom they were obliged to carry off. Our prospects are flattering, and, if rightly improved, there is reason to expect we shall 
soon be at ease. It affords me very singular pleasure to hear you have finally settled the tranquility of the district of Little Pee Dee; so happy 
a conclusion to an affair, which, in its first stage, wore but a gloomy aspect, reflects great honor on you, sir, and promises lasting advantage 
to the State. Pray, is Graney returned; I wish he may not be playing 
a fast and loose game. Mr. David Rumph has proposed to me to raise a party of militia horse for the protection of the part of the country he 
lives in. I have directed him to apply to you to know whether you approve of the plan. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
