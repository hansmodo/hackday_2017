</p><p>
DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I received <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague">Mr. Monroe</a>'s letter, mentioned to you by 
Mrs. Read, near a fortnight since. It is dated January 28th, 
but the day before that of Mr. Skipwith to you, but it docs 
not contain a syllable upon the subject which he requests 
you to recommend, and indeed this affair appears to me so 
very mysterious, that I think it necessary at least to under 
stand and be understood before I act. 
</p><p>
I would write to the lady herself, was I not restrained by 
considerations of prudence. I must therefore request you 
to answer Mr. Skipwith by the first mail, that I fully concur 
in the sentiments and dispositions expressed in his letter 
to you, and that I am not only willing but anxiously desirous 
to contribute as far as in my power to the same purpose, 
but I have no discretionary authority whatever over my 
public monies ; that if I had, it would be impossible for me 
to make any advance upon the single document he sent for 
me ; that as the demand upon me expressly purports to be 
a recurrence to our nation, it asks what as the representative 
of the nation I have no power to grant ; that, nevertheless, 
I will with pleasure take measures to have the sum demanded 
paid according to the request, if it is desired, but that in order to enable me even to ask repayment from the Ameri 
can government, I must have some document to show that 
the charge is equitable ; that at present I do not even know 
what the charge would be. That if the present state of 
affairs necessitates particular discretion, I will be content 
with an assurance from our Minister at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, from Mr. Skipwith, or from the lady herself, that I shall in future be 
provided with documents to warrant a solicitation for indemnity on my part. That if nothing of this can be done, 
I will, if the lady will consent, have the money paid and 
consider it as a private debt repayable by her or by whoever receives it. 
</p><p>
I know not a human being upon earth entitled upon so 
many principles, and by such imperious obligations, to the 
exertions for relief of every American citizen, the inhabit 
ants of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> particularly, and of me individually, as 
the person to whom this demand may be supposed to allude ; 
and it is painful to me that the request comes under circum 
stances which compel me to a moment's hesitation or delay. 
But compliance to the thing required of me is impossible, 
and I think I cannot execute another thing as a substitute, 
without knowing whether it will answer as such. . . .
