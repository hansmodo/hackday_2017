Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
To-morrow Generals Sheridan and Pope will meet here 
to discuss the Indian troubles. We could settle them 
in an hour, but Congress wants the patronage of the 
Indian bureau, and the bureau wants the appropriations 
without any of the trouble of the Indians themselves. 
I don't suppose in the history of the world there is 
such a palpable waste of money as that bestowed on the 
Kioways, and no wonder our government is sinking 
deeper and deeper into debt. We have spent in the past 
seven months, at least half a million dollars in bringing 
down these Indians, and this is the fourth time since I 
have personal knowledge of the fact. . . . 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately,
