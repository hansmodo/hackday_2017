My Dear Brother Smith:  The question which was the subject of my
earnest consultation with you on the 18th inst. has in my own mind
been decided.  After the most anxious inquiry as to the correct course
for me to pursue, I concluded to resign, and sent in my resignation
this morning.  I wished to wait till the Ordinance of secession should
be acted on by the people of Virginia; but war seems to have commenced,
and I am liable at any time to be ordered on duty which I could not
conscientiously perform.  To save me from such a position, and to
prevent the necessity of resigning under orders, I had to act at once,
and before I could see you again on the subject, as I had wished.  I
am now a private citizen, and have no other ambition than to remain
at home.  Save in defense of my native State, I have no desire ever
again to draw my sword.  I send you my warmest love.
</p><p>
                             Your affectionate brother,
</p>
