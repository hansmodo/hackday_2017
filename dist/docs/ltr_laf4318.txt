My dear General, 
</p><p>
I most heartily thank you for your letter, elated 
March the 19th ; the more welcome to me, as I had 
long lamented your silence, and was panting for news 
from you, wherein I could be informed of every thing 
respecting your public and private concerns. I rejoice and glory in the happy situation of American 
affairs. I bless the restoration of your health, and 
wish I could congratulate you on your side of the 
Atlantic. 
</p><p>
But we are not in that state of tranquillity, which 
may admit of my absence ; â€” the refugees hovering 
about the frontiers ; intrigues in most of the despotic 
and aristocratic Cabinets; our regular army divided 
into Tory officers and undisciplined soldiers ; licentiousness among the people not easily repressed; the 
capital, that gives the ton to the empire, tossed about 
by anti-revolutionary or factious parties ; the Assembly fatigued by hard labor, and very unmanageable. 
However, according to the popular motto, ga ira, it 
will do. We are introducing, as fast as we can, religious liberty. 
</p><p>
The Assembly has put an end to her existence by 
a new convocation ; has unfitted her own members for 
immediate reelection and places in the Executive; and 
is now reducing the Constitution to a few principal 
articles, leaving to the Legislative Assemblies to examine and mend the others, and preparing every thing 
for a Convention, as soon as our machine will have 
had a fair trial. I stand the continual check to all 
interior factions and plots. By the inclosed speech 
of mine, and the giving up my commission, I gave a 
spring to the power of law over licentiousness ; and 
was I equally supported in repressing it, as I should 
be against aristocratic exertions, the people could 
soon be brought to a proper sense of liberty. As to 
the surrounding Governments, they hate our revolution, but do not know how to meddle with it, so 
afraid they are to catch the plague. We are going to 
take measures to discipline the army, both officers 
and soldiers. They will prepare to encamp and leave 
the cities. They will have the same power as in 
time of war. M. de Conde and his party will be 
summoned to explain themselves, and, if they continue caballing and enlisting, declared traitors. To 
M. de Ternant I refer for more particulars. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> and myself had long thought that Ternant was a very proper man to act as French 
Minister in America. He in great measure belongs to both countries. He is sensible, honest, well-informed, and has a plain and decisive way of doing business, which will be very convenient. He has 
long been an officer under your command, feeling and acting in an American capacity. He is personally much attached to you ; and I had, in this revolution, many instances to experience his friendship to 
me. He might have been a Minister in the Council, but was rather backward on the occasion, and behaved as a prudent, not an ambitious man. So that 
I take him to be fit to answer your purpose. He will let you know what has passed in the Assembly respecting American affairs. 
</p><p>
The last transactions are an undoubted proof of their sentiments, . and show that the faux pas, in the regulation of duties, is to be attributed to the want 
of knowledge or sense, not of friendship. They have considered me as an American, who did only mind 
American profit, and did not know matters so well as a few mercantile men, most of them on the aristocratic side of the House, who presented foolish calculations; and you know the difficulties to unmake our 
decrees. But you may depend on this point, that brotherly measures to unite the two nations with the ties of most intimate affection, of common principles 
and common interest, will be most heartily received in France; and on that ground you may work your 
plan, and send it to France, with a private copy for me. The United States and France must be one 
people, and so begin the confederation of all nations who will assert their own rights. 
</p><p>
I have, in the affair of the black free men, acted according to my conscience, not to policy. Should 
the British look for advantage of honesty, I hope you will influence the Colonies to submit to a decree so conformable to justice. 
</p><p>
Mr. Short, who does the business of the United States with all the zeal and ingenuity of a most patriotic and most sensible man, who is respected and 
loved in France in a manner equally useful to the public and honorable to himself, has written to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> respecting <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>. France will do 
every thing in her power to bring Spain to reason; but will have a difficult and probably unsuccessful 
task. Upon the whole, that navigation we must have ; and, in case the people of Louisiana wish to make a 
fifteenth State, who can help it? and who ought, Spaniards excepted, not to rejoice at it? For my part, certainly, I should not be a mourner. 
</p><p>
My best respects to Mrs. Washington. My compliments to the family ; to my dear Aid, George, and 
his family. Most respectfully and affectionately, my 
beloved General, 
</p><p>
Your filial friend, 
</p><p>
