</p><p>
SIR: I received this morning your letter of the 12th instant, and, in giving 
to it an immediate and explicit answer, I trust you will perceive the propriety of my confining myself to the direct object of your inquiries. 
</p><p>
In the course of the last summer, I received a letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>, 
referring to the consultations of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Monroe</a> with the heads of the Departments, in the summer of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>, upon the proceedings of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a> in 
Florida, on the occasion of the Seminole war, and alluding to a letter from 
General Jackson to Mr. Monroe, which he stated to have been produced at 
one of those meetings, and to which his own letter appeared to attach some 
importance. 
</p><p>
Mr. Crawford did not state to me the purpose of his inquiries, nor was I 
aware that any previous correspondence in relation to the subject had taken 
place. But as the contents of his letter appeared to me to be of peculiar interest to the character of Mr. Monroe, I answered him that I had no recollection of the production of such a letter as that te which he referred, and 
requested his permission to communicate his letter to Mr. Monroe himself. 
To this answer I have received no reply. 
</p><p>
Neither the letter of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>, nor the letter book containing the 
copy of my answer to it, are at this moment in my possession, having left 
them both at my residence in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=quincy" rel="city">Quincy</a>. The letter from Mr. Crawford did not purport to be confidential; but, as it related to transactions sacredly confidential in the cabinet of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Monroe</a>, I have not thought myself at liberty 
to furnish a copy of it without his permission, even to Mr. Monroe: the 
same principle applies to your request for a copy; but I will immediately 
write and direct a copy of my answer to be made, which, when received shall be cheerfully communicated to you. 
</p><p>
I am, with respectful consideration, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
