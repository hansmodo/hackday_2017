THE IMMENSE resources of California, as yet only partially developed, afford to the political economist and to business men a fruitful theme of contemplation. Although there is now much individual suffering and misfortune, the elements of prosperity are at work which, in an unparalleled short period in the history of
nations, must place it among the most prominent States of the Union for wealth and extensive business operations. With a most prolific soil, a genial climate, with vast mineral wealth, the genius of the people only requires the fostering protection of a liberal government to develop these resources, and where public effort fails in many instances to carry out important ends, individual associations will not be wanting for their consummation. In a country so new as California, having so vast a field for varied enterprise, Government cannot at once effect all the facilities necessary for the transaction of the immense business carried on by its citizens; and the commercial world, but for individual association, would labor under immense disadvantages. The transmission of dust and coin from one extreme point to another, from the most distant mines over almost impracticable mountain roads to the Atlantic States, would be next to impossible, with certainty, by any Government provision. The merchant at home or in the cities along the Pacific seaboard might look in vain for remittances if dependent on Post Offices, and at isolated points the poor, toil-worn miner would live for months without the gratification of hearing from home or of sending a portion of his hard-earned gains to those who are dearer to his memory than life, were it not for the express companies which individual enterprise has established. These, in fact, have grown out of the necessity of the case, and by system, energy, and perseverance have grown into an important link in the great chain of commercial enterprise.

At first established for the speedy transmission of letters, money, and small packages from one important town to another along the principal roads and thoroughfares of the Atlantic States, by degrees they have spread, like the veins of the human system from the principal arteries, not only over the body corporate of our own country, but their fibres reach Europe, Asia--in fact, the whole civilized globe; and no country has felt their vivifying influence more than California. These connected links reach every mountain and dell where civilized man finds an abiding place. Almost every bar and diggings beyond the reach of mail arrangements has its connecting express line, and the glistening eye of the sunburnt miner, as through them he receives the missive of love from home, attests the estimation in which they are held in California. But for them, how many hearts would be sad--how many hopes disappointed!

Why, I myself had toiled a year, suffering all that human nature could endure on the plains and in the mines, without hearing a single word from my family, and although they had written monthly by the mail, the first letter I received to tell me they were still alive was delivered into my hands by a mountain express To Californians and those connected with them, this is a matter of infinite
importance, and a grand consideration is that of responsibility. No man likes to trust valuable packages to irresponsible hands, and it is a matter of public congratulation that companies of undoubted means, as well as of indomitable energy, are in existence. Livingston and Wells are known among the successful pioneers of expresses, and I see by the public papers that they are extending their operations by association to California, under the name of Wells, Fargo and Company. These veterans of the Express are too well known for comment. Some of those connected with them I have known from childhood, and I speak understandingly when I say that more energetic, faithful, and perfectly responsible men do not exist in any express company than these. They have commenced their California Express with an actual capital of three hundred thousand dollars, have contracted for the transmission of parcels with the U. S. Mail steamers, thus avoiding the possibility of delay, and they send a trusty messenger with every ship. Their arrangements for crossing the Isthmus are such that speed and certainty are assured, and drafts drawn by them are honored as surely as those of any bank in the Union.

The ramifications of their express will extend to every mining district in California, as it does now to nearly every town in the Atlantic States; and the estimation in which they are held on the Atlantic will insure their success on the Pacific side of the continent. As an old miner, knowing the wants and feelings of that busy class of our California community, I most humbly wish them success. I sail on the 5th for San Francisco, and you will hear from the again as usual, from time to time
