Dear Robert, 
</p><p>
The pleasure I expected from a junction of all our families at Bristol has vanished. Dr. Bard tells me the waters 
there would be injurious to Mrs. Jay's complaints ; so that 
I shall again take a solitary ride to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, whenever the Convention, who directed me to abide here until their 
further order, shall think proper to dismiss me. 
</p><p>
Messrs. Alsop and Lewis set out next Saturday for 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. <a href="/results.php?tla=jad" rel="colleague">Mr. Duane</a> informs me that he is about to 
return home, and considering how long he has been absent 
from his family, I think him entitled to that indulgence. I 
pray God that your health may enable you to attend constantly, at least till it may be in my power to relieve you. 
Is Mr. Clinton returned? 
</p><p>
Our Convention will, I believe, institute a better government than the present, which in my opinion will no longer 
work anything but mischief; and although the measure of obtaining authority by instructions may have its advocates, 
I have reason to think that such a resolution will be taken as will open a door to the election of new or additional 
members. But be the resolution what it may, you shall have the earliest advice of it. And should my conjectures 
prove right, I shall inform the members of Duchess of your readiness to serve, and advise them to elect you. 
</p><p>
Don't be uneasy at receiving so few letters from me. I have been so distressed by the ill health of my wife and parents, that I have scarce written any thing. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Robert, your affectionate friend, 
</p><p>
