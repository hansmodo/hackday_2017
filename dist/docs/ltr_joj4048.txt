Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Wherever and however occupied, I rememher my friends, 
and always find my own satisfaction promoted when I have 
reason to think that I am conducing to theirs. This has 
led me to make your sons the subject of this letter. It is 
an interesting one to you, and therefore not indifferent 
to me. 
</p><p>
On my arrival here, I found them placed in a. pension at 
Passy. My daughter was ill with a whooping-cough, and, 
lest your sons should catch it, we denied ourselves the pleasure of having them with us until after that obstacle had 
ceased. I have frequently seen them at <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a>'s, as 
well as at my own house. They had promised to dine with 
us every Wednesday, but Mr. Ridley prolonged it to every 
other Wednesday. They are fine boys, and appear to possess a full share of natural talents. I am told that theyhave made a progress in French proportionate to the time 
they have been learning it. Of this I am not an adequate 
judge myself, and therefore must depend on the judgment 
of others. The pension at which they are has been so far 
well enough; but I think, with Mr. Ridley, that a better is 
to be wished for, and to be sought. He is at present 
making the necessary inquiries, and I have every reason to 
believe that the trust you have reposed in him will be conscientiously and faithfully executed. 
</p><p>
Mr. Ridley finds it difficult to decide on the expediency 
of carrying them to Geneva ; and, from what 1 have heard, 
I think he has reason to entertain doubts on that head. As 
I have no materials to judge from but the report of others, 
and those perhaps not altogether well-founded, it is difficult for me to form a decided opinion on the subject. I 
can only say, that I have heard more against it than for it. 
</p><p>
My opinion may perhaps seem singular, and the more so as it cannot be properly explained in the compass of a letter. 
I think the youth of every free civilized country should, if 
possible, be educated in it, and not permitted to travel out 
of it till age has made them so cool and firm as to retain 
their national and moral impressions. Connexions formed 
at school and college have much influence, and are to be 
watched even at that period. If judiciously formed, they 
will often endure and be advantageous through life. American youth may possibly form proper, and perhaps useful, 
friendships in European seminaries, but I think not so probably as among their fellow-citizens, with whom they arc to 
grow up, whom it will be useful for them to know and be 
early known to, and with whom they are to be engaged in 
the business of active life, and under the eve and direction 
of parents whose advice, authority, and example are frequently of more worth than the lessons of hireling professors, particularly on the subjects of religion, morality, 
virtue, and prudence. 
</p><p>
The fine, and some of the useful, arts may doubtless be 
better acquired in Europe than America, and so may the 
living European languages ; but when I consider that a 
competent knowledge even of these may be gained in our 
countrv, and that almost all of the more substantial and 
truly valuable acquirements may, in my opinion, with more 
facilitv and certainty be attained there than here, I do not 
hesitate to prefer an American education. 
</p><p>
I fear that the ideas which my countrymen in general 
conceive of Europe are in many respects rather too high. 
If we should ever meet again, you shall know my sentiments 
very fully on that head. 
</p><p>
But your sons are here, and what is to be done ? !Mr. Ridley is about doing what I think, with him, is the best 
thincr that can at present be done, viz. to put them in one 
of the best pensions that can be found, and to give them 
the advantage of such extra tutors as may be requisite. 
</p><p>
Perhaps further information may place Geneva in a more 
favourable light. You shall have frequent letters from me 
on this subject ; and while I remain here, you may be 
assured of my constant attentions to these promising boys. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
With great esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend and servant, 
</p><p>
