DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have just received yours of yesterday, and will 
duly attend to those things you recommend to my 
consideration. At present I have to inclose you a 
letter from Congress, which I suppose contains their 
resolves of the 20th instant; but as the President 
does not say, in his letter to me, that they are in 
closed to you, and as it is necessary you should 
have them, I take the liberty to send herewith a copy of them.
</p><p>
I am well pleased to see the attention they pay 
General Lee ; and I shall make it a point to collect 
and send your Excellency, soon as possible, the 
one hundred half Johannes they order. You will 
observe Mr. Clymer, Mr. Walton, and myself are appointed a Committee to transact the Continental business here, that may be necessary and proper ; and I 
apprehend that it will frequently be necessary that 
we should know the substance of your correspondence with Congress.! Your letters to the President, 
if sent open under our cover, shall always meet despatch, and their contents kept secret; and when you 
think it improper we should see them before the 
Congress, seal them, and they shall go forward untouched ; and, if you do not approve of submitting 
them to our inspection at all, write us freely, and 
your wishes in that respect shall be complied with. 
</p><p>
We have just heard of your success at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>. The account is but imperfect ; but we learn you are 
master of that place, and all the baggage and stores our enemy had there, and of three hundred prisoners and that your troops were still in pursuit of the 
flying enemy. I have just wrote to Congress, and 
told them thus much, as the substance of an account 
just come down; and I told them further, I had been 
informed that you had executed in this matter your 
part of a well-concerted plan; that <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='colleague'>General Heath</a>,- at Hackensack, had orders from you, and that General Ewing and Colonel Cadwalader, also, had orders to 
cross the Delaware at the same time you did, but had been prevented by driving ice. 
</p><p>
Good news sets all the animal spirits to work. 
The imagination is heated, and I could not help adding , that I expected <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='colleague'>General Heath</a> was to continue 
his march towards Brunswick, which would draw the 
attention of any troops posted there and at Prince 
ton, while you would pursue the flying heroes to Bordentown and Burlington, where Ewing and Cadwalader would stop them, and cut off their communication with the two thousand Hessians and 
Highlanders, that came after Griffin ; nay, I almost 
promised them that you should, by following up this 
first blow, finish the campaign of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a> with that 
eclat that your numerous friends and admirers have 
long wished for. I congratulate you most heartily on 
what is done ; and am, with perfect esteem, dear Sir, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
