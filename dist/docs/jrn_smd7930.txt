Mother has come to me ! O how glad I was to see her this morning! And the Georgia project, which I 
dared not speak of for fear it should be mere talk and nothing more, is a reality. -- Yes! we are actually 
going! I can hardly believe that such good fortune as getting out of that wretched <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> really awaits 
us. Perhaps I shall not like <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a> either ; a stranger in a strange city is not usually enchanted with 
everything one beholds; but still a change of scene a new country new people it is worth 
while! Shall we really go? Will some page in this book actually record "<a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a>, Georgia"? No! I 
dare not believe it ! Yet the mere thought has given 
me strength within the last two weeks to attempt 
to walk. Learning to walk at my age ! Is it not amusing? But the smallest baby knows more about it 
than I did at first. Of course, I knew one foot was to be put before the other; but the question was how it 
was to be done when they would not go? I have conquered that difficulty, however, and can now walk 
almost two yards, if some one holds me fast.

Sunset. Will [Pinckney] has this instant left. 
Ever since dinner he has been vehemently opposing 
the Georgia move, insisting that it will cost me my 
life, by rendering me a confirmed cripple. He says he 
could take care of me, but no one else can, so I must 
not be moved. I am afraid his arguments have 
about shaken mother's resolution. Pshaw! it will do 
me good! I must go. It will not do to remain here. 
Twenty-seven thousand Yankees are preparing to 
march on Port Hudson, and this place will certainly 
be either occupied by them, or burned. To go to 
<a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> is to throw myself in their hands, so why not 
one grand move to <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a>?
