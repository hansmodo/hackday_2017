Thursday morning I commenced work upon a lot in partnership with two men, and after ditching and clearing off the top of the ground, we came to the top of the blue clay. We washed a few panfuls from which we found enough dust as we think will pay us for washing with a cradle. We intend to wash in that way and see how it turns out. If it pays well, we intend to get a pump as one is now kept steadily bailing water out of the hole, and we have to work in soft mud and water six inches deep. But yesterday upon going to the hole we had dug, we found that it was entirely filled and overflowed with water, and it was deemed impracticable to work unless we stood in water up to our knees. Not feeling at all well, I concluded that we would have to abandon it for the present, and we did nothing the remainder of the day. We saw several lumps of gold belonging to an Irishman who is in partnership with a colored man and an American. The largest lump was a beautiful specimen of pure gold weighing just a pound.

Mr. Speeden returned our rifles, but not in half as good order as when he received them, as well as losing the extra tube out of the box of Atkins'. Neither did
they replace the bullets or powder that they used, as they promised they would upon taking them away. So much for lending.

The party found the young man, Smith, about 14 miles distant, still alive and in very good spirits, with the marks of eight arrow shots. They brought him in but it is feared his wounds will yet prove mortal. I understand a strong party contemplates scouring the mountains thoroughly in a few days, in search of the bloody savages.
