DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have been honored with your Excellency's two 
letters of the 26th and 28th April, and am extremely sorry to find it should be thought there was a necessity of postponing my trial to so late a period 
as June or July, from no other reason than the President and Council of this State representing that 
the period appointed for the purpose, and the previous notice given, were too short to admit of the 
necessary evidence being produced in time. 
</p><p>
Their pretence of the witnesses being in Virginia 
and Carolina, and the time being too short to produce them, I can view in no other light than a base, 
pitiful evasion; evidently calculated to put off the 
trial, that my character, unjustly aspersed, may still 
suffer, while the villains who have injured me cowardly cloak themselves under office. They have had 
three months to look for evidence, and cannot produce one against me v I suppose the gentlemen they mention being in Carolina are my two Aids, gone there, as volunteers, to spend the summer. They left 
this city long since the Court-Martial was ordered, 
and might easily have been detained, had the Council thought proper to do it. 
</p><p>
Believe me, my dear General, the whole is nothing 
more than pretence and artifice to delay the matter, 
the final determination of which must make the President and Council appear to the world in their true 
colors, as a set of unprincipled, malicious scoundrels; 
who have prostituted their honor and truth, for the 
purpose of gratifying their private resentment against 
an innocent person. 
From a candid view of the charges and whole proceedings against me, contained in the papers transmitted to your Excellency, you must be fully persuaded I have been unjustly accused, and that I have 
been refused justice from Congress on the report of 
their Committee. 
</p><p>
From a knowledge of my public conduct, since I 
have been in the army, no man is a better judge if 
I have merited the treatment I have received. If 
your Excellency thinks me criminal, for Heaven's sake 
let me be immediately tried, and, if found guilty, 
executed. I want no favor ; I ask only for justice. 
If it is denied me from your Excellency, I have 
nowhere to seek it but of the candid public, before 
whom I shall be under the necessity of laying the 
whole matter. Let me beg of you, Sir, to consider 
that a set of artful, unprincipled men, in office, may 
misinterpret the most innocent actions; and, by raising the public clamor against your Excellency, place 
you in the same disagreeable situation I am in. 
</p><p>
Having made every sacrifice of fortune and blood, 
and become a cripple in the service of my country, 
I little expected to meet the ungrateful returns I 
have received of my countrymen; but, as Congress 
have stamped ingratitude as a current coin, I must 
take it. I wish your Excellency, for your long and 
eminent services, may not be paid in the same coin. 
</p><p>
I have nothing left but the little reputation I have gained in the army. Delay, in the present case, is 
worse than death ; and, when it is considered that 
the President and Council have had three months to 
produce" their evidence, I cannot suppose the ordering a Court-Martial to determine the matter immediately, 
in the least precipitating the matter, which, in justice, 
the President and Council wish to put off until the 
campaign opens \ concluding, undoubtedly, that the 
service will then prevent the Court from sitting, the 
trial postponed until the end of the campaign, and 
their cruel and villanous purposes answered. I must,therefore, entreat your Excellency that a Court-Martial 
may be ordered to sit as soon as possible ; and, if 
the Court find sufficient reasons, they will of course 
adjourn to a longer time. Not doubting my request 
will be granted, I have the honor to be, with the 
highest respect and esteem, your Excellency's 
Most obedient, humble servant,
