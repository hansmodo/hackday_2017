Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Several affairs, more interesting to others than to me, 
have for some months past so pressed upon me, as, together 
with official business, to leave me little leisure to attend 
even to my own concerns. Hence I have been constrained 
into delays respecting my correspondents, which could not 
have been less agreeable to their feelings than to my own. 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the several communications with 
which you have favoured me. The facts which you have 
given to the public relative to the conduct of France in our 
revolution, as well as your strictures on the designs and 
intrigues of the illumines, have, to a certain extent, been 
useful. They have made proper impressions on many 
sedate and candid men, but I suspect they have detached 
very few of the disciplined adherents of the party. As 
yet, there appears but little reason to believe that philosophism is losing ground in our country. There is indeed 
less said about it, but indications of immorality are neither 
less frequent, nor more odious and disgraceful in common 
estimation than heretofore. A moral epidemic seems to 
prevail in the world. What may be its duration, or the 
limits of its ravages, time only can ascertain. 
</p><p>
The approaching general election in this State will be 
unusually animated. No arts or pains will be spared to 
obtain an anti-federal representation, in order to obtain an 
anti-federal president, &c. and through him divers other 
objects. 
</p><p>
The late revolution in France does not appear to have 
dissipated the clouds which veiled from our view the fate 
of that and other countries. As yet, I see little reason to 
expect the restoration of the Bourbon family ; nor is it 
certain that great good would result from it. Of the issue 
of the present interesting campaign, no satisfactory conjectures can yet be formed; and nothing at present appears 
which presents a fair prospect of a speedy termination of 
the miseries of Europe. Your envoys in France will probably succeed; but whether that success would ultimately 
promote our tranquillity and happiness, is a point on which 
many judicious men differ in opinion. 
</p><p>
We have lost much in <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>General Washington</a>, whose death 
you and others have made the subject of eloquent discourses. From the state of our parties and affairs, some 
are persuaded that he has been taken from evil to conic It 
may be so ; but I fear that such apprehensions are sometimes indulged too far, and that they often disqualify men 
from meeting either good or evil in a becoming manner. 
With great esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant.
