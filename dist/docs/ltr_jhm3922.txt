SIR: 
</p><p>
I received yours of the 27th the last evening. The information 
both <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> and myself had received, agree that there were two 
parties going out one Northwardly, and the other Southwardly. How 
ever, I am very happy to find they have dropped the Northern expedition, which I am in great hopes will leave you at leisure to form some 
plan, if possible, to put a stop to this infamous traffic, that is carried 
on with the town through Goose Creek and down Cooper River. I 
cannot help thinking it reflects no great credit on our cavalry in this 
part, to lie still in their quarters and suffer about a dozen or twenty 
negroes to come out almost every night in the week, and carry off 
cattle, horses, and anything else they want, within twelve or fifteen 
miles of their camp; but I have spoke of it so often, that I am deter 
mined never to mention the matter again. I must entreat you, sir, to 
form some plan which will be most effectual to stop such a shameful 
commerce; it is no less villainous than true that the Charlestown mar 
kets are now daily supplied with the greatest plenty of everything they 
want. There is no political consideration whatever that can induce me 
to alter the substance of my proclamation. I must request you to have 
it carried into the most rigid execution. I am clearly convinced nothing 
will do with the Southern militia until you are at leisure to undertake 
the management of them. The news contained in the paper you sent 
me is very important indeed, and I trust will lead to happy consequences. 
I observe they are contending for a restoration of the confiscated estates. 
This, I knew, would be the case, and told the House of Assembly so 
when they were about passing the Confiscation Act ; for it is a matter 
</p><p>
that must be finally settled by negociation. I enclose you a copy of a letter I have just received from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>. Poor <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Laurens</a> ! I am 
very sorry for his fate. I also enclose you twenty blank commissions, which were omitted to be sent before. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
