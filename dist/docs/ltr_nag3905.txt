DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 13th inst. is this moment came to hand. The 
prospect of a general action is not so immediate as I expected a few 
days ago. You will, therefore, halt in the neighborhood of Strawberry 
</p><p>
Ferry, and wait there, or in that neighborhood, until you hear further 
from me. I don t believe the enemy will make another excursion soon 
into St. Thomas , but they may. I should be obliged to you to get an 
account of all the forage in that quarter; with us it is scarce. I begin 
to feel afraid our cavalry will be obliged to cross the Edisto for subsistence. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
