Rev. Sir, 
</p><p>
I received by the last mail your letter of the 19th September, containing a copy of " An act to incorporate the 
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions," 
and an abstract from their minutes, purporting, that at a meeting of the board in September last, I had been elected a member of it. 
</p><p>
Such institutions become the religion we profess, and the 
blessings we enjoy. Be pleased to assure the board that I 
am very sensible of the honour they have done me; and 
that I wish it was as much in my power, as it is in my 
inclination, to attend their meetings and take an active part 
in the business committed to them. For several years my 
health has been declining, and my age, as well as the nature 
of my complaints, do not permit me to expect the restoration of it. 
</p><p>
Reflecting that they who consent to accept a place or 
office do impliedly engage to perform the duties of it, I 
think it right to declare my inability to perform those in 
question. If, therefore, any active services should be expected from me, I hope and request that the board will 
consider themselves at liberty to give to this declaration 
, the effect of a resignation, and proceed to elect another in 
my stead. 
</p><p>
I am, reverend sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
