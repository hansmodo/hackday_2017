In all my life I have never been grossly insulted until now -- and that by my husband
</p><p>
Do not dare to write me again, or expect ever to receive another line from me until you can assure me of your unlimited confidence in me and feel sincerely repentant for the terrible things you have said to me. I have never lived with you on other terms than those of the most perfect love and trust and equality.

I never intend to live with you on other terms. I love you and I hope to be your true wife for time and eternity but I cannot (God helping me) will not) cast my womanhood from me. I trust you fully in spite of circumstances if need be -- —I will receive nothing less in return.
