<a rel='month origin' value='1'>January</a> <a rel='day origin' value='22'>22d</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. At Mrs. Lyons's met another beautiful 
woman, Mrs. Penn, the wife of Colonel Penn, who is making shoes in a Yankee prison. She had a little son with her, 
barely two years old, a mere infant. She said to him, " Faites comme Butler. " The child crossed his eyes and 
made himself hideous, then laughed and rioted around as if he enjoyed the joke hugely.

Went to <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis's</a>. It was sad enough. Fancy having to be always ready to have your servants set your, house 
on fire, being bribed to do it. Such constant robberies, such servants coming and going daily to the Yankees, carrying 
one's silver, one's other possessions, does not conduce to home happiness.

Saw <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> on his legs once more. He rode off on a fine horse, and managed it well, though he is disabled in one 
hand, too. After all, as the woman said, " He has body enough left to hold his soul. " " How plucky of him to ride 
a gay horse like that. " " Oh, a Kentuckian prides himself upon being half horse and half man ! il And the girl who 
rode beside him. Did you ever see a more brilliant beauty ? 
Three cheers for South Carolina ! ! "

I imparted a plan of mine to Brewster. I would have a breakfast, a luncheon, a matinee, call it what you please, 
but I would try and return some of the hospitalities of this most hospitable people. Just think of the dinners, suppers, 
breakfasts we have been to. People have no variety in war times, but they make up for that lack in exquisite cooking. 
</p><p>
" Variety? " said he. " You are hard to please, with terrapin stew, gumbo, fish, oysters in every shape, game, 
and wine as good as wine ever is. I do not mention juleps, claret cup, apple toddy, whisky punches and all that. I 
tell you it is good enough for me. Variety would spoil it. Such hams as these Virginia people cure ; such home-made 
bread there is no such bread in the world. Call yours a cold collation. ! " Yes, I have eggs, butter, hams, game, 
everything from home; no stint just now; even fruit." 
</p><p>
" You ought to do your best. They are so generous and hospitable and so unconscious of any merit, or exceptional 
credit, in the matter of hospitality. " They are no better than the Columbia people always were to us." So I fired 
up for my own country.
