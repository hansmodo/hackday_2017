On the eighth, as I anticipated, we met the enemy 
on the prairie and fought them five hours whipping 
them severely. It was mostly a cannonade, the Fifth 
being the only regiment closely engaged. To describe 
more particularly our position on the eighth we 
had proceeded quietly on our route until near twelve 
at noon when we learned that the enemy were in 
great force in our front some two miles. We almost 
immediately halted at some ponds, all getting a re 
freshing drink. We were then deployed in order 
of battle and marched steadily forward until we saw 
the enemy s line more than a mile distant. The 
Fifth Infantry was the right of our line, then Ring- 
gold s battery, next the Third and Fourth Infantry, 
next two eighteens under Lieutenant Churchill, then 
eleven companies of artillery, the Eighth Infantry, 
and on the extreme left Duncan s battery protected 
by a squadron of Dragoons. Our force in the aggregate was less than twenty-one hundred men and we 
were encumbered by a large wagon train (about two 
hundred) loaded with stores and ammunition for the 
fort. The Mexican lines extended far beyond our 
right and left, and we have since ascertained that they 
had more than seven thousand regular troops in the 
field. The action commenced by a cannonade from 
the enemy s right and was soon followed by the pieces 
at the intervals through their entire line. Ringgold s 
and Duncan s batteries were at once thrown forward 
replying with a most deadly fire. The enemy s shot 
were playing briskly through our ranks, the wounded 
and dying at our feet producing no effect upon the 
admirable discipline of the men the occasional expression of a wish to charge being the only evidence 
that they felt their position out of musket range and 
exposed to the deadly fire of many cannon. Our 
eighteens opened at the same time with the other 
guns and evidently produced confusion in the enemy s 
centre. We soon saw the movement of a large force of 
cavalry from the Mexican left toward our right with 
the evident intention of taking us in the flank. It 
was seen by our General, and the Fifth were ordered 
to the right and front to intercept them. After 
rapidly marching more than one-fourth of a mile the 
word was, " Here they come ! " and we at once formed 
square against cavalry and stood firmly at a shoulder. 
They rode upon us eight hundred strong. When about 
a hundred feet from us they delivered their fire and 
continued their charge. A few of our men fell wounded 
but not a man wavered. At this moment the fire of 
our second front was delivered with as much precision 
as on drill, and with a most withering effect. Walker s 
rangers, about twenty of whom were on our right, 
gave them their rifle balls with their usual coolness 
and deadly aim. They immediately broke to the left 
and went off at a run. During the charge, two pieces 
from Ringgold s battery under Ridgely had come up 
in our rear and as the ground would not allow them 
to pass on our flanks, we by a side movement gave 
them room to fire and their deadly grape and canister 
completed the rout which we had so well begun. 
The cannonade continued until night closed in when 
the spectacle was magnificent. The prairie was burn 
ing brilliantly between the two armies and some 
twenty pieces of artillery thundering from right to left, 
while through the lurid scene was heard the tramp 
ing of horses and the wild cheering of the men. After 
dark our train was parked upon the battle field and 
we lay upon our arms until daylight. This ended the 
battle of Palo Alto. Major Ringgold and Captain 
Page mortally wounded. The enemy suffered horribly, 
having by their own statement about five hundred 
killed.

In the morning our line was formed, our train left 
entrenched, defended by a rear guard and four twelve- 
pounders. The Fifth was pushed forward by heads 
of companies to a point of chaparral a half mile in 
advance of the line. The ground was reconnoitred 
and it was ascertained that the main body had re 
treated during the night, having buried a portion of 
their dead. Skirmishes under Captains McCall and 
C. F. Smith were thrown in advance to feel the enemy 
and ascertain their position. 
</p><p>
Between eleven and twelve we marched, the Fifth 
in advance followed by Ringgold s battery under 
Ridgely. After marching six miles we learned that 
the skirmishers had discovered the enemy strongly 
posted two miles in our advance. It is almost im 
possible to understand with what our little army had 
to contend unless the ground is seen. On each side 
extending for miles was a dense thorny thicket or 
chaparral cut by deep ravines and narrow ponds 
through which passes the road to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a>. As 
we advanced we heard the skirmishers engaged - 
halted to let Ridgely s battery pass, and then immediately deployed as skirmishers to the left of the 
road and pushed for the enemy. The chaparral broke 
us into small parties and when I came up to the 
skirmishers under McCall I had not more than twenty 
of my men with me and not another of the Fifth in 
sight. The enemy s grape and canister from ten 
pieces, nines, and sixes were whipping the bushes about 
our ears, the small shot falling thickly amongst us. 
I, at this time, examined their position. They were 
strongly posted on a ravine which crosses the road 
where it makes a slight turn. It was deep and the 
crest opposite us entrenched to protect their Infantry 
- the whole surrounded by a thicket so dense that we 
could not see into it. The few of us who were in this 
advanced position saw at once the absolute necessity 
of charging their guns to gain the battle, and for this 
purpose moved to the right where we were joined by 
many more of the Fifth on the edge of the road. We 
had already begun our charge when the shout came 
down the road, " Charge Fifth ! " A squadron of 
Dragoons charged by us immediately into their batteries. Most gallantly was it done while the welkin 
rung with our tremendous cheers. May dispersed 
the party at their guns but could not of course, with 
horse, maintain them. The Fifth dashed into the 
ravine after them and from right to left the most 
desperate hand-to-hand fighting ensued. The enemy 
here fought like devils. Our men, however, knew that 
if conquered they would get no quarter and there was 
no possibility of a retreat, and though surrounded by 
vastly superior numbers fought with desperation. 
Their aim was steady and often with a rest in the 
fork of a bush. In the hand-to-hand conflicts which 
were occurring in every part of the field our officers 
and men were decidedly superior. 
</p><p>
The desperate conflict could not last and the Mexicans fled utterly routed. They were followed to the 
neighborhood of the fort where they took the river in 
every direction receiving the fire of the eighteens on 
the parapet as they were swimming over. We have 
heard that three hundred were drowned in crossing, 
including their priest and several officers. Thus terminated one of the most desperate actions in which 
our army was ever engaged. We lost in killed and 
wounded about one hundred and forty. Lieutenant 
Inge fell in May s charge. Lieutenants Chadbourne 
and Cochrane on the eighth. Colonels Mclntosh and 
Payne, Captain Hove, Lieutenants Gates and Jordan 
were badly wounded and many others slightly. The 
enemy must have lost at least one thousand men in 
the action and in the retreat. Of the Tampico Guarda 
Costas, one of the best regiments in their service, only 
twenty-six escaped. We took eight pieces of artillery, 
fifteen hundred stand of small arms, two hundred and 
forty thousand rounds of musket cartridges, about 
six hundred pack mules with all their packs, their 
camp equipage and the personal baggage of the officers, 
General Arista s portfolio, plate, tent, etc. The artillery battalion under Childs was held in reserve dur 
ing the action, so that we actually had only about 
fourteen hundred men engaged while the enemy had 
a larger force than on the eighth, having been reenforced during the night by one thousand choice troops 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a>. They thought they had us in a 
cul-de-sac and cannot account for our victory. Edmund behaved with great gallantry taking a piece 
and bringing it from the midst of the enemy. But it 
is impossible to make distinctions where all fought 
with equal courage. I saw no man falter and the object of each seemed to be to find the largest crowd of 
Mexicans. It is a glorious fact for the army that there 
were no volunteers with us. What will Mr. Black 
say now about the little drill sergeants, etc. ?
