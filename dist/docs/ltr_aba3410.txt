MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
I do not expect to date you any more letters from this 
place. Delightful and blooming garden, how much 
shall I regret your loss ! The fish-pond and the 
fountain are just put in order : the trees are in blossom, 
and the flowers are coming on in succession ; the 
forest trees are new clad in green, several beautiful 
rows of which form arched bowers at the bottom of 
our garden, the tops being cut so that they look like 
one continued plain ; their leaves and branches entwine, and shade you entirely from the rays of the 
sun. It will not be easy to find in the midst of a city 
so charming a scene. I shall quit it, however, with 
less reluctance, on account of my son's absence, 
which would be more irksome to me here, than in a 
country the language of which I shall be able to speak 
without an interpreter, or so much twisting and 
twirling of my tongue, and then pronouncing badly 
at last. I expect to be more scrutinized in England 
than here. " I said, I will take heed to my ways," 
is a text of holv writ fruitful of instruction in all 
situations of life, but speaks more loudly to those who 
sustain public characters.

It is so long since I heard from my American 
friends, that I begin to grow impatient. I had hopes 
that another year's wandering would have put an 
end to our pilgrimage. You can hardly form an 
idea how difficult and expensive it is to be housekeeping a few months at a time in so many different 
countries. It has been <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a>'s fortune, ever 
since he came abroad, not to live a year at a time 
in one place. At the Hague he has a house and 
furniture, but they could not be removed five hundred miles ; therefore it was necessary to hire a 
house and furniture here, to buy table linen, bed 
linen, china, glass, and plate. Here we have resided eight months, and now we must quit this for 
England. Removal in these countries is not so 
easy a matter as in ours ; for, however well you may 
pack up your things for the purpose, they must undergo so many scrutinies, besides paying heavy duties for passing from one country to another. Of this 
I can give you one instance, which happened a few 
moments ago. A gentleman in one of the provinces 
sent <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> a present of five bottles of wine 
which he wished recommended in America, and this 
was to serve as a sample. The duties, which we 
had to pay upon only those five bottles, mounted 
them up to three livres a-piece, and the real value 
of the wine might be nine or ten coppers a bottle ; 
be sure, not more.

The injury which clothing sustains, in such long 
journeys upon paved roads, is incredible. I fancy 
I never related to you a droll adventure which happened to me on my journey here. My friends advised me, when I came abroad, to take my money in 
crowns and dollars, as being the most advantageous 
for me ; but, when arrived, I found I could not part 
with them without much loss, so I concluded to take 
them with me to France. There were about two 
hundred, which I had put into a strong bag, and at 
the bottom of my travelling trunk they were placed, 
in the middle of which I had put a large band-box 
in which I had packed a very nice gauze bonnet, 
four caps, handkerchiefs, &c, (to the amount of about 
five guineas,) which I had made for me whilst I was 
in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>. The third day of our journey, when I 
had occasion to open the trunk, I found a prodigious 
black dust upon the top. I directed it to be taken 
out, when O ! terrible to behold, " dust to dust, and 
ashes to ashes," nothing was left of all my rigging 
but a few black rags ; so that, when I got to Paris, I 
could not be seen until I had sent to the milliner's 
and bought a cap. You can carry nothing with any 
safety, but what is upon the top of the carriage. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
A. A.
