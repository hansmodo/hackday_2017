<a rel='month origin' value='9'>September</a> <a rel='day origin' value='21'>21st</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. Went with Mrs. Rhett to hear Dr. Palmer. I did not know before how utterly hopeless was 
our situation. This man is so eloquent, it was hard to listen and not give way. Despair was his word, and martyrdom. 
He offered us nothing more in this world than the martyr's crown. He is not for slavery, he says ; he is for freedom, and 
the freedom to govern our own country as we see fit. He is against foreign interference in our State matters. That is 
what Mr. Palmer went to war for, it appears. Every day shows that slavery is doomed the world over; for that he 
thanked God. He spoke of our agony, and then came the cry, " Help us, God! Vain is the help of man." And 
so we came away shaken to the depths.

The end has come. No doubt of the fact. Our army has so moved as to uncover Macon and Augusta. We are going 
to be wiped off the face of the earth. What is there to prevent <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> taking <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>General Lee</a> in the rear? We have 
but two armies, and <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> is between them now. l
