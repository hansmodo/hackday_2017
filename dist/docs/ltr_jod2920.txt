AFTER a series of the severest and harshest weather 
that ever I felt in this climate, we are at last blessed 
with a bright sun and a soft air. The weather here 
has been like our old easterly winds to me and southerly winds to you. The charms of the morning at 
this hour are irresistible. The streaks of glory dawning in the east ; the freshness and purity in the air, 
the bright blue of the sky, the sweet warblings of a great variety of birds intermingling with the martial 
clarions of a hundred cocks now within my hearing, all conspire to cheer the spirits.

This kind of puerile description is a very pretty employment for an old fellow whose brow is furrowed 
with the cares of politics and war. I shall be on horseback in a few minutes and then I shall enjoy the 
morning in more perfection. I spent last evening at the war office with General Arnold. He has been 
basely slandered and libelled. The regulars say, u he fought like Julius Ca?sar." l I am wearied to death with the wrangles between military officers, 
high and low. They quarrel like cats and dogs. They worry one another like mastiffs, scrambling for 
rank and pay, like apes for nuts. I believe there is no one principle which predominates in human nature 
so much, in every stage of life, from the cradle to the grave, in males and females, old and young, black 
and white, rich and poor, high and low, as this passion for superiority. Every human being compares 
itself in its imagination with every other round about it, and will find some superiority over every other, 
real or imaginary, or it will die of grief and vexation. I have seen it among boys and girls at school, among 
lads at college, among practitioners at the bar, among the clergy in their associations, among clubs of friends, 
among the people in town meetings, among the members of a House of Representatives, among the grave 
councillors, on the more solemn bench of Justice, and in that awfully august body, the Congress, and on many of its committees, and among ladies every where ; but I never saw it operate with such keenness, ferocity and fury, as among military officers. They will 
go terrible lengths in their emulation, their envy and revenge, in consequence of it.

So much for philosophy. I hope my five or six babes are all well. My duty to my mother and your 
father, and love to sisters and brothers, aunts and uncles. Pray how does your asparagus perform ? &c. I would give three guineas for a barrel of your cider. 
Not one drop is to be had here for gold, and wine is not to be had under six or eight dollars a gallon, and that 
very bad. I would give a guinea for a barrel of your beer. The small beer here is wretchedly bad. 
In short, I can get nothing that I can drink, and I believe I shall be sick from this cause alone. Hum at 
forty shillings a gallon, and bad water will never do, in this hot climate, in summer, when acid liquors are necessary against putrefaction.
