From Salt Lake City we returned by stage to the Pacific road, and proceeded on our way westward by rail. For many miles we ran along the margin of the great Salt Lake valley through a region whitened with a crust of soda or alkali, which appeared to the eye as if there had been a recent fall of snow. In many other parts of this country the soil is encrusted in a similar manner, and so deeply impregnated with this alkaline substance, as to destroy all vegetation.
</p><p>
On leaving the valley, we ascended Promontory Point, winding our way up by zigzag lines along the ledges of rock, which crop out and overlook the great Salt Lake basin. The view is as grand as it is extensive. We dined at the station on the summit. The dining hall is constructed with rough boards outside, and lined inside with white muslin. The dinner was excellent and
politely served. Here for the first time our dessert consisted of California fruits, grapes, pears, and apples, very large, fine and delicious. The charge was one dollar in gold. From this station westward gold is the general circulating medium, but as a matter of accommodation to passengers, greenbacks are received at the stations in payment of traveling expenses.

After we left Promontory Point we frequently passed gangs of Chinamen at work, repairing and finishing up the road. They are a strange looking set of chaps, and look as much alike as two peas. They are much smaller in stature than Americans, have dark yellowish skins, smooth, round faces, black hair and black almond eyes; and as we passed them, they grinned and smiled in a manner that was truly comical. They are a quiet, submissive and respectful people in their demeanor. Some were dressed in Chinese costume, and others in half American style. They lodge in very low cloth tents, three or four feet high, and in some instances, instead of tents, they burrow in earth-mounds which resemble kennels. As laborers, they are faithful and efficient, working from sunrise till sunset, without regard to the ten hour system, and if they do not always mind their P's, they certainly do their queues. When at work they wear their queues, which are about
four feet long, coiled up, like a lady's switch, on the back part of the head.

We had now entered upon the vast plain, through which flows the Humboldt river, with here and there a bald-headed mountain and low range of equally bald hills. At this season of the year no green thing is seen, not even a tree, shrub, or blade of grass. It is a barren desert, silent as it is vast, producing nothing but sage brush. The soil is strongly impregnated with alkali. The dust which arises from the plain as the cars pass, is anything but agreeable. It parches the lips and skin, and irritates the throat and nasal linings to a degree that is often tormenting.

At most of the stations along this part of the route, we saw groups of Indians, men, women and children, standing idle and curious to see the train and its novelties, and begging for money, bread, meat, clothing, or anything else the passengers might please to give them. Dressed partly in Indian costume, and partly in old cast-off American garments, they created quite a sensation among the passengers, who enjoyed hugely their comical appearance. These Indians are remnant tribes, known as Shoshones, and Piutes, who are now regarded as quite harmless, but were once numerous and formidable; often at war with each other; and sometimes plundered and murdered
emigrants. But now "the wing of their spirit is broken." The onward march of civilization has overtaken them, and will soon extinguish the race.

The Humboldt river is comparatively small, larger in the direction of its source than at its termination, owing to the absorption of its waters in the sand as it flows. It is two hundred and fifty miles long, and empties into a lake of the same name. Along its course there are some grand and sublime scenes--especially the pass between the Palisades, a twin range of perpendicular rocks, fifteen hundred feet high, and apparently split asunder by volcanic action. In other places you will see granite rocks projecting from the faces of the round headed hills, resembling dragon's teeth, and reminding you that you are entering the dismal realms--if not the very jaws of destruction--yet this valley, in some seasons of the year, wears a cheerful aspect, as compared with the dry season, and affords excellent pasturage. The old emigrant trail may still be traced through its entire extent.

On reaching Reno, which is located on the eastern slope of the Sierras, we again stopped off, and took the stage to Carson City, the capital of Nevada, distant thirty-three miles. On the way we passed the famous "Steamboat Springs," near the road-side. They derive their name from the fact
that they puff like a steamboat under sail, and throw out on the air a trailing wreath of smoke or cloud, which induces you to look for the passing boat. But on examination, instead of a steamboat, you find several extensive fissures in the rocky surface of a treacherous spot, where the steam issues, and where it seems to be generated by a current of heated water, which you can hear bubble and hiss beneath your feet, and which is hot enough to boil potatoes in a few minutes. Whether the water is heated by a combination of chemical ingredients deep down in the earth, or by volcanic fires, is a question for science to settle; but at present the phenomenon remains a mystery. If you were to stand on the spot where I stood, I am sure you would think the infernal regions something more than a theological fiction.

Soon after passing the springs we entered Washoe, a small village in a deep valley, famous for its silver mines. It has several quartz mills at work, day and night, and turns out a large amount of bullion. It is located midway between Reno and Carson City. Like Washoe, Carson is also located in a deep valley, known as Eagle Valley, and is surrounded by picturesque mountains, clad with pines. The city is situated on the Carson river, which winds its way gracefully along the valley, and contains a population of four or
five thousand. It is a much larger and richer town than Washoe, and is alike famous for its quartz mills and production of bullion, It now has a railroad connecting it with Virginia City, whence it derives most of its silver ore to supply its Mills. Being the seat of government for Nevada, nearly all the State officials reside here, the Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, and Judges of the Supreme Court. The State officials are all gentlemen of intelligence and pleasing manners. In a word, they are not only men of brains and refined manners, but an honor to the State. The salary of the Supreme Judges is seven thousand dollars each, and this is paid in gold coin. One of them, Judge Johnson, was Governor of California, in the days of the famous Vigilance Committee. As yet, Nevada has no State House, and for the present, the Legislature and Supreme Court hold their sessions in rented halls, and the public offices are kept in side-rooms. The State Library is quite extensive for so young a State.

Nevada has exhibited her wisdom in making liberal provision for common schools, both by taxation and appropriation of public lands. She is about to erect for herself a magnificent State House. She has already built a Penitentiary, a very fine, substantial stone edifice, which is kept in excellent condition, and under a strict system of
discipline. It has, at this time, thirty-six inmates or convicts, three of whom are Chinamen; but no women. There is also a splendid Mint at Carson, which has just been erected by the Federal Government. The structure is of stone, spacious in its dimensions, and an ornament to the town. The quartz mills in the vicinity are doing a prosperous business. The rock mineral is pulverized by immense hammers or stamps, to a fine powder, and then run through vats in currents of water, the silver settling at the bottom from its weight. It is then collected by commingling quicksilver with the mass and separating it. I saw masses of silver bullion lying about loose, as large as I could lift, and vainly wished I could have as much as I could carry on my shoulder. If my wish had been granted, doubtless, I should have felt the need of more backbone than I possess. Nevada abounds, not only in the precious metals, but in copper, tin, lead, iron, coal, and quicksilver. In fact, her elements of wealth are inexhaustible. Every mountain is a mine, and every valley a granary. A thousand years will not disclose the half of her hidden treasures.
