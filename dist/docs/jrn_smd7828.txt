Yesterday, and day before, boats were constantly arriving and troops embarking from here, destined 
for <a href='/results.php?city=vicksburg' rel='city'>Vicksburg</a>. There will be another fight, and of course it will fall. I wish Will was out of it; I don't 
want him to die. I got the kindest, sweetest letter from Will when Miriam came from Green well. It 
was given to her by a guerrilla on the road who asked if she was not Miss Sarah Morgan.
