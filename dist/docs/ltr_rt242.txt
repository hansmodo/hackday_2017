<p> To Darling:
<p> I&#8217;ve been thinking of you a lot today and wish you could have shared the day with me. No, - it wasn&#8217;t exciting, just comfortable- and our first warm Sunday! Seemed so good to get outside with out a coat on and just know you had plenty of time to go somewhere- anywhere- just as long as you were out. Four of us went down to the Capital and walked around it and the Supreme Court. I hate to admit it- but that was the first time for me and I&#8217;ve been here nearly eight months! We took 2 rolls of films and if any come out well I&#8217;ll send you a few. 
<P> I got two letters from you the first part of the week- and thanks. You seem to be very happy in your last letter- maybe partly because you were going to be on the move again. Also, you say that I&#8217;m so good to you- I can&#8217;t figure that out- for I&#8217;m not nearly as good to you as you are to me. However, let that be as it may be- I&#8217;m glad that I can give you a ray of sunshine now and then- and hope I don&#8217;t fall short too much. 
<p> I do hope you received my letter written in answer to yours of the 20th before you left. I&#8217;ve been wondering what you think of it and the following one written a few days later. I dream also, I must admit, but I also have streaks of being most horribly matter of fact about the whole business and arguing pro and con mentally with myself- and it always ends up with the same things I set down in the letter. 
<p> Goodnight dear, and I hope selfishly that I hear from you tomorrow- or sometime this week, aren&#8217;t I self centered though? But if I don&#8217;t, I know that you are doing a bang up job and I&#8217;m so proud of you. 
<p> No, I didn&#8217;t get the Valentine, but that is a very minute matter, now there are much more important things than Valentine&#8217;s.

<p> Monday, Feb. 22
<p> Darling, your Valentines arrived today- and I&#8217;m so thrilled and happy I&#8217;m practically silly! They are beautiful, and for a wonder I had a vase to put them in- quite an item living as I am- out of dresser drawers you might say! Oh, they are lovely- 1 doz. Red roses- and also the thought that lies behind them too! I feel as if I don&#8217;t deserve them- but thanks anyway- and you certainly know how to get me happy! And everyone else is envious too! In fact, 2 were so envious they couldn&#8217;t even remember to say the things they should have! Well I don&#8217;t blame them, for it is a big thrill, and made more so when you can imagine how difficult it must have been!
<p> Donna and I went to see &#8220;Yankee Doodle Dandy&#8221; tonight- and it is simply wonderful. James Cagney does really good acting and is very well supported too. It&#8217;s one picture I know I&#8217;ll see several more times. Surprisingly too- the stage show was excellent. First good one- all good- I&#8217;ve seen here in Washington. Bye for now-
and thanks again- wish I could thank you personally but this will have to do until I can.
