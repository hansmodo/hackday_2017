HOST. JOHN SHERMAN, 
</p><p>
United States Senate. 
</p><p>
When a senator or member of Congress discovers in 
some newspaper a statement which he considers offensive to himself, he rises to a question of privilege, 
and makes his statement of facts. Now when an outsider finds himself misrepresented in the Congressional 
Eecord, I suppose he may rise and make his statement 
of facts. 
</p><p>
In the Congressional Eecord, Saturday, February 25th, 
the Hon. James B. Beck is reported as having said that 
General Sheridan had come to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> at an expense 
to the United States of a thousand dollars, to assist in 
having his father-in-law, General Rucker, made a brigadier-general and quartermaster-general for the purpose 
of being retired with increased pay. I know that General Sheridan was ordered to come to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> by 
Secretary of War Lincoln, for an entirely different matter, at an expense of not to exceed $200, viz. eight cents 
a mile, coining and going by the shortest possible mail 
route, according to a law made by the Congress of which 
Mr. Beck was a member. 
</p><p>
Mr. Beck is further reported to have said that General 
Sherman was in the habit of travelling, with his large 
staff, in palace cars at the expense of the United States, 
nominally to inspect posts, but really for pleasure. Now 
this is so totally untrue, and so diametrically opposed 
to my usage, that I am simply amazed. Not a cent can 
be drawn from the Treasury of the United States without the warrant of law. I never hired a palace car in 
my life, surely not at the expense of the United States, 
for no quarter-master would pay the voucher, and if such 
voucher exist, it can be had on demand of any senator. 
</p><p>
General Sherman, like every army officer, is entitled 
by law, and receives eight cents a mile when travelling 
on duty. My duty and inclination carry me to the 
remotest parts of our country, where travel usually costs 
from ten to twenty-five cents a mile. 
</p><p>
I think the law ought to provide me a palace car, 
and I think Mr. Beck agrees with me, and supposes such 
to be the fact. I have not a particle of doubt he supposed such to be the fact, else he would not have asserted 
it on the floor of the Senate ; but I beg you will on some 
opportune occasion tell him it is not true, but on the 
contrary, that the Government expects me to make tours 
of the Indian frontier chiefly at my own cost. The 
general or lieutenant-general draws the same travelling 
allowance as a second lieutenant. No more and no 
less. 
</p><p>
The general of a department has the right to inspect 
every post of his command, so the General of a division 
is expected to be familiar with the condition of every 
post within his sphere of command; and, of course, the 
commanding general has a similar right. Without this 
right an intelligent commander would be impossible. 
By this system I am kept informed of everything pertaining to the military establishment in peace as well as 
war, and the constant inquiries by Committees of Congress can thus alone be answered, and I will not alter 
or change my plans to suit Senator Beck. 
</p><p>
I believe it is construed as discourteous to refer to 
a senator in debate by name, thus you are addressed 
as the Honorable Senator from Ohio, but I infer the 
rules of the Senate are not so punctilious about the names 
of outsiders. Thus Senator Beck spoke of Generals 
Sheridan and Sherman by name, and not by office. 
</p><p>
We are not ashamed of our names, and have no objection to their free use on the floor of the Senate. We 
fear nothing, not even a positive misstatement, but it 
surely adds nothing to the dignity or manliness of a 
senator to attempt to misrepresent an absent officer of 
the common Government, sworn to obey its laws, and to 
submit to such measures as it, in its wisdom, may prescribe. . . .
