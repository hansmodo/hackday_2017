MY DEAR PORTIA, 
</p><p>
I YESTERDAY received a letter of the 26th of April 
from brother Cranch, for which I thank him and will 
answer as soon as possible. He tells me you have 
drawn a little bill upon me. I am sorry for it, be 
cause I have sent and should continue to send you 
small presents, by which you would be enabled to do 
better than by drawing bills. I would not have you 
draw any more. I will send you things which will 
defray your expenses better. The machine is horribly dear. Mr. C. desires to know if he may draw on 
me. I wish it was in my power to oblige him, but it 
is not. I have no remittances, nor any thing to depend 
on. Not a line from Congress, nor any member, since 
I left you. My expenses through Spain were beyond 
all imagination, and my expenses here are so exorbitant, that I can t answer any bill from any body, not 
even from you, excepting the one you have drawn. 
I must beg you to be as prudent as possible. Depend 
upon it, your children will have occasion for all your 
economy. Mr. Johonnot must send me some bills. 
Every farthing is expended and more. You can 
have no idea of my unavoidable expenses. I know- 
not what to do. Your little affairs and those of all 
our friends, Mr. Wibird, &c., are on board the Alii-, and have been so these four months, or ready 
to be. Pray write me by way of Spain and Holland, 
as well as France. We are all well. My duty to 
your father, my mother, and affection and respects 
where due. My affections, I fear, got the better of 
my judgment in bringing my boys. They behave 
very well, however.

<a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> is in the horrors. Governor Hutchinson fell 
down dead at the first appearance of mobs. They 
have been terrible. A spirit of bigotry and fanaticism mixing with the universal discontents of the nation has broken out into violences of the most dreadful nature, burned Lord Mansfield's house, books, 
manuscripts ; burned the king's bench prison and 
all the other prisons, let loose all the debtors and criminals, tore to pieces Sir George Saville's house, insulted all the lords of Parliament, &c., &c. Many 
have been killed, martial law proclaimed, many 
hanged. Lord George Gordon committed to the 
Tower for high treason, and where it will end, God 
only knows. The mobs all cried, peace with America, and war with France. Poor wretches ! as if this were possible ! 
</p><p>
In the English papers they have inserted the death 
of Mr. Hutchinson with severity, in these words. 
" Governor Hutchinson is no more. On Saturday last 
he dropped down dead. It is charity to hope that his 
sins will be buried with him in the tomb, but they must 
be recorded in his epitaph. His misrepresentations 
have contributed to the continuance of the war with 
America. Examples are necessary. It is to be 
hoped that all will not escape into the grave with 
out a previous appearance either on a gibbet or a 
scaffold."

Governor Bernard, I am told, died last fall. I wish 
that, with these primary instruments of the calamities 
that now distress almost all the world, the evils them 
selves may come to an end. For although they will 
undoubtedly end in the welfare of mankind, and accomplish the benevolent designs of providence towards 
the two worlds, yet, for the present, they are not joyous but grievous. May heaven permit you and me 
to enjoy the cool evening of life in tranquillity, undisturbed by the cares of politics or war, and above all, 
with the sweetest of all reflections, that neither ambition nor vanity, nor avarice, nor malice nor envy, nor 
revenge nor fear, nor any base motive or sordid passion through the whole course of this mighty revolution, and the rapid, impetuous course of great and 
terrible events that have attended it, have drawn us 
aside from the line of our duty and the dictates of 
our consciences. Let us have ambition enough to 
keep our simplicity or frugality, and our integrity, and 
transmit these virtues as the fairest of inheritances to i 
our children.
