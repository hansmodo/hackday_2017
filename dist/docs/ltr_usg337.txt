DEAR FATHER:
</p><p>
I received your two letters announcing the death of Clara. Although I
had known for some time that she was in a decline, yet I was not
expecting to bear of her death at this time.--I have had no heart to
write earlier. Your last letter made me feel very bad. I will not state
the reason and hope I may be wrong in my judgment of its meaning.
</p><p>
We are now having fine weather and I think will be able to wind up
matters about Richmond soon. I am anxious to have Lee hold on where he
is a short time longer so that I can get him in a position where he
must lose a great portion of his army. The rebellion has lost its
vitality and if I am not much mistaken there will be no rebel army of
any great dimensions in a few weeks hence. Any great catastrophe to any
one of our armies would of course revive the enemy for a short time.
But I expect no such thing to happen.
</p><p>
I do not know what I can do either for Will. Griffith's son or for
Belville Simpson. I sent orders last fall for John Simpson to come to
these Head-Quarters to run between here and Washington as a mail
messenger, but he has not come. I hope this service to end now soon.
</p><p>
I am in excellent health but would enjoy a little respite from duty
wonderfully. I hope it will come soon.
</p><p>
My kindest regards to all at home. I shall expect to make you a visit
the coming summer.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p>
ULYSSES.
