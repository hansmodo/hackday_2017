Nov. 14th <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1854">1854</a> My dear sister
</p><p>
You must excuse this short letter and also my not having written to you at an earlier day, for my eyes have become so bad as to make me very careful with them. You wrote to me that should your health not prevent your coming to see me that I might have expected your arrival several days since.
Elinor Jackson obituary
I went to the Hotel to see whether you had attempted such a journey. Though I would like to see you, and appreciate your very sisterly affection, yet I would not like for you to attempt coming over such a road, with all its harassments, so do not attempt it. When my next vacation will enable me to leave (which I cannot do now without neglecting my duties) I trust that God will again permit me to see your face.

My Dear Ellie thought to pass over the stage route from here to Beverly was a hard undertaking for her. After she returned home she was pleased with her visit. She has now gone on a glorious visit though through a gloomy portal. Her companion are of the glorified Host. I look forward with delight to the day when I shall join her. Religion is all that I desire it to be. I am reconciled to my loss and have joy in hope of a future reunion where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest. I am much obliged to you for you kind desire to come and stay with Ellie.

Your affectionate brother, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jjt" rel="me">Thomas</a>.
