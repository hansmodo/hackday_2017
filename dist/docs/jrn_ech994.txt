This morning the Captain went ashore and purchased a considerable addition of flour and potatoes. About four P.M. we hoisted our anchor and set sail again for Eldorado. One of the passengers, R. C. Stocton, not being aboard, a sharp lookout was kept as we expected he would overtake us in a small boat. When we had proceeded about three or four miles, we espied a small boat making its way for us, but the sea being very heavy, it made little progress and we had to "bout ship" and stand in for them. Four oarsmen were in the boat and when they reached us they were very tired.

It is 165 days since we left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and we have made about two-thirds of the way. We hope to land again in sixty daysthe distance yet is about five or six thousand miles. Many of the passengers are seasick, and I begin to feel a little that way myself.
