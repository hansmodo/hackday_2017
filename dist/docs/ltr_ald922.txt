ONCE more a miner--once more a delver in earth in search of its hidden treasures. Speculation, merchandise, literary efforts, idling and the various employments which men are forced into in this unparalleled country, unparalleled for good and evil, have again settled into primitive operations, and I am again a mountaineer, my castle a cabin, my frills a red shirt, my hope in the mines, and my heart with my family beyond the Missouri. But gracious heaven! what a change two years has produced.
</p><p>
When I detailed to you, in my first letters, the toils and hardships of the miner exemplified in my own experience, I little thought that in so brief a space of time such a mighty change would occur. Where we then climbed mountains weary and fainting under the heavy loads we carried on our backs, where by difficult paths a mule brought us our hard and homely fare, where the bare means of existence was all we expected--now good roads are opened with daily stages running over them from the principal towns in the Valley; these roads are lined with comfortable houses for the accommodation of travellers, where the luxuries of life may be had in profusion, and a vast number of teams loaded with all the necessaries and comforts for man are constantly passing. Villages and towns are springing up among the hills which exhibit the life and bustle of trading towns, and society,though by no means purified of its excrescences, begins to assume the form of civilization. Immense works are undertaken which might daunt the resolution of wealthy capitalists at home, and are carried through with success. In short, in every direction you behold a sublime spectacle of the energy and indomitable perseverance of a free people, who think and act for themselves, and make science and art their slaves in securing the talisman of Earth--gold. Rivers and creeks are turned from their channels and carried by canals miles along mountains, over hills, across gulches, by means of aqueducts, for forty miles or more, thus distributing the indispensable element to the miner for separating the gold from the earth and opening to man rich deposits which could not be worked without water.

The water of Deer Creek is thus turned and by ditches, troughs and hose is carried many miles in various directions, giving employmen to thousands who without it would be idle; and a canal is in progress, to be forty miles in length, which will turn the water of Bear River from its bed for a similar purpose, as well as expose its
own rich deposits to the miner. Another gigantic scheme was in agitation, and the stock of the company was subscribed. This was to turn the Yuba for similar purposes, high in the mountains, with a canal of sufficient capacity to float lumber and ice to the Valley. It was then projected to continue the canal across the plain to the mouth of the American River, thus supplying Sacramento City with lumber and ice--the latter an essential article in this fervid climate. The engineer assured me the route and work were feasible, except about forty or fifty rods, where it would have to pass along a perpendicular cañon so high that there were no means of erecting works for a flume, and so many difficulties presented themselves at that point which seemed to require the whole wealth of California to overcome, that the plan was reluctantly abandoned, for the present at least.

Since the discovery of gold in its matrix, which are the quartz veins extending apparently through the whole length and breadth of the country, a new impulse has been given to the energies of Californians. There is at this place perhaps more machinery in active operation at this time than at any other point in the State, although it is highly probable that many other places are quite as rich which still remain undiscovered. At this time there are six steam quartz mills and one water mill in operation, and one steam mill and another water-crushing mill are in progress of erection. Instead of one hill and one vein of quartz, it appears by examination that many veins exist in nearly all the hills in this region, and this gives such a certainty for continuing operations for a term of years--a permanency of business--that the mountain valleys are being taken up for farms and cultivated; good buildings are erected in the villages, and this hitherto wild and inhospitable mountain country is fast assuming the settled condition of the active, bustling, yet permanent towns of the iron mountains of Pennsylvania.

Notwithstanding the horde of villains who throng in our midst, the high character of the miners and operatives for intelligence and various acquirements still deservedly continues. Among them I have for a neighbor and friend, Mr. Frederick M. Catherwood, celebrated the world over as an artist and traveler You would little dream that that modest, quiet man, standing by that puffing, stamping, noisy crushing mill, without a particle of ostentation in his manner, dressed in a plain, coarse, drab corduroy dreadnought coat and pants, with high coarse leather boots reaching above his knees, his head covered with a broadbrim California hat and his somewhat
prominent nose bridging a pair of spectacles, was the artist who illustrated the admirable works of Stephens' Petraea and Yucatan, with drawings taken on the spot It is even he, and if you would make him blush, why speak to him of his works? He has too much modesty to intrude himself on your notice, but if you will draw him out you will find him a gentleman as well as an artist, and he is the president of his company and one of the proprietors of the mill.

A year ago there were no inhabitants here.--Occasionally a solitary miner might be seen resting his weary limbs in the shade of a magnificent pine, or while prospecting under the weight of his blankets, mining tools and transient supply of pork and hard bread, keeping a cautious watch with his hand on his trusty rifle to guard against surprise, not knowing but in another instant an arrow from the bow of some lurking treacherous savage might terminate his toil and earthly career at one and the same moment. Now in this immediate vicinity there are probably two thousand men at work, with all the comforts of life within their reach, and the only danger is from the robber and midnight assassin, and these are now held in check. Families are coming in, and although female influence is but little felt, still the germ is laid, and the lower mines will soon present that feature in the happiness of isolated man.
</p><p>
I must confess, however, that my former ideas of the purity and stern morality of the opposite sex have been somewhat lowered--perhaps my ideas have been too exalted--but it too often happens here that females who have borne unexceptionable characters at home adopt the code of morals of the country and instead of endeavoring to stem the current, float along with it. I am no casuist and will not seek for the cause. This sentiment may draw down upon me the frowns of my fair countrywomen at home, but I can't help it, and as I am no candidate for even a place in their affections, I shall take the world as I find it and ask no favors.

Near us is an Indian ranch filled with dirty, squalid, disgusting savages, but as I have given you a picture of Indian life, I will not advert to it now. They are peaceable and quiet, and their chief is friendly to the whites. The nights are getting cold, and my blankets are scarcely sufficient to keep me warm, but the days are hot.
