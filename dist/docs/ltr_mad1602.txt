DEAR SIR, The Convention of New Hampshire has afforded 
a very disagreeable subject of communication. It has not rejected the Constitution, but it has failed to adopt it. Contrary 
to all calculations that had been made, it appeared, on a meeting 
of the members, that a majority of three or four was adverse to 
the object before them, and that, on a final question on the merits, 
the decision would be in the negative. In this critical state of 
things, the federalists thought it best to attempt an adjournment; 
and having proselyted some of the members who were positively 
instructed against the Constitution, the attempt succeeded by 
a majority of 57 against 47, if my information as to the numbers be correct. It seems to be fully expected that some of the 
instructed members will prevail on their towns to unfetter 
them, and that, in the event, New Hampshire will be among the 
adopting States. The mischief elsewhere will, in the mean time, 
be of a serv.us nature. The second meeting is to be in June. 
This circumstance will probably be construed in Virginia as 
making contemporary arrangements with her. It is explained 
to me, however, as having reference merely to the conveniency 
of the members, whose attendance at their annual elections and 
courts would not consist with an earlier period. The opposition, I understand, is composed precisely of the same description of characters with that of Massachusetts, and stands contrasted to all the wealth, abilities, and respectability of the 
State. 
I am preparing to set out for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=orange" rel="city">Orange</a>, and promise myself the 
pleasure of taking Mount Vernon in the way. 
</p><p>
I remain, yours most respectfully and affectionately.
