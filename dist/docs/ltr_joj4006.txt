Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Mr. Cuyler informs me, that some of my friends in your 
county have done me the honour of naming me, among 
other candidates, for the office of governor. 
</p><p>
In my opinion I can be more useful in the place I now 
hold ; and therefore, though the other is far more respectable as well as lucrative, yet, sir, the regard due to the public good induces me to decline this promotion. 
</p><p>
I thought it necessary that you and others should be 
informed of my sentiments on this subject ; and it would 
give me pleasure to hear, that the electors in <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> had 
united in a design of voting for some one gentleman whose 
spirit, abilities, and reputation might recommend him to 
that important office. 
</p><p>
Our constitution is universally approved, even in NewEngland, where few New-York productions have credit. 
But, unless the government be committed to proper hands, 
it will be weak and unstable at home, and contemptible 
abroad. For my own part, I know of no person at present 
whom I would prefer to <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a>. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>.
