DEAR SIR, The prospect in Massachusetts seems to brighten, 
if I view in the true light the following representation of it: 
" This day, (January 30,) for the first time, our President, Mr. 
Hancock, took his seat in Convention, and we shall probably 
terminate our business on Saturday or tuesday next. I cannot 
predict the issue, but our hopes are increasing. If Mr. Hancock does not disappoint our present expectations, our wishes 
will be gratified." Several reflections are suggested by this 
paragraph which countenance a favorable inference from it. I 
hope, from the rapid advance towards a conclusion of the business, that even the project of recommendatory alterations has 
been dispensed with. 
</p><p>
The form of the ratification of Georgia is contained in one 
of the papers herewith enclosed. Every information from 
South Carolina continues to be favorable. I have seen a letter 
from North Carolina, of pretty late date, which admits that a 
very formidable opposition exists, but leans towards a federal 
result in that State. As far as I can discover, the state of the 
question in North Carolina is pretty analogous to that in Virginia. The body of the people are better disposed than some 
of a superior order. The Resolutions of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> for calling 
a convention appear, by the paper, to have passed by a majority 
of two only in the House of Assembly. I am told this proceeded in some degree from an injudicious form in which the 
business was conducted, and which threw some of the federalists into the opposition. 
</p><p>
I am just informed by a gentleman who has seen another letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, of the same date with mine, that the plan of 
recommendatory alterations has not been abandoned, but that 
they will be put into a harmless form, and will be the means of 
saving the Constitution from all risk in Massachusetts. 
</p><p>
With the highest respect and attachment, I remain, Dear 
Sir, y r affect 6 and hum 16 serv.
