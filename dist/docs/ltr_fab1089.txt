I rec'd your letter of the fifth all right, and I must give you the credit of writing a very interesting one. Your muse must have been inspired with news for you told me more than ever I knew. I see Bucksport has lost none of its propensity for gossip.

As to Tim's being intemperate, it's the first that ever I heard of it. I never saw him the least disguised from drinking. He wishes me to refute the charge but we had a good laugh about it.

As to the story about me, it is just as I expected and wonder that I have not heard of something of the kind
before. But they have got on the wrong track. The old maids in B. will have hard work to find out when I am engaged to any girl. I have not seen the Thompsons since they moved from Brooklyn last Nov. You appear to be having some parties at Bucksport, but the idea of having whist is a new one there. I am glad they are introducing it. I suppose you and those other families left out constitute an Upper Ten-dom, in the place. People will do so in every place, small or large. I have to adapt myself to all classes of men and women and small children but always move in the first society if you can, that is my motto. I have found out that it is altogether better to get an honest living and live in a parlor and wear kid gloves than live in a camp and haul cord wood, a life which I once thought would suit me.

I attended the great Mendelssohn Concert at Castle Garden. The tickets were gratis. Of course there was something of a crowd, probably 10,000 persons. It took us an hour to get out. Last night Arthur and I went to a concert given by the young ladies of the Female Academy. There was a grand display of kids and white dresses and curls. About two hundred of the scholars did the singing. Some of the pieces were very fine and as many pretty girls as ever I have seen in one room together.

If you want something to amuse you in Bucksport why don't you get up some Model Artistes. They are all the rage out here. There are a dozen troupes in the city now. Statue of the Greek Slave is completely outdone by living models. Nobody goes to see marble statues now. What an age we live in!--to say nothing of chloroform.

I do not attend dancing school. Reason: not money enough.

I am perfectly willing for you to show Mother my letters. I don't intend to do anything that I am ashamed to have her know.
