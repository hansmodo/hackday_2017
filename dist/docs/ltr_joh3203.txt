SIR, 
</p><p>
It is now above two years since I have had the 
honor of presiding in Congress ; and I should esteem 
myself happy to have it in my power to render further service to my country in that department ; but 
the decline of health, occasioned by so long and unremitting an application to the duties of my office, 
both in Congress and out of Congress, joined to the 
situation of my own private affairs, has, at length, 
taught me to think of retiring for two or three months ; and I have determined to take my leave 
the ensuing week, and set out immediately for <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> after this express returns. 
</p><p>
As the Congress will doubtless proceed to appoint a successor in my stead, on him, therefore, will devolve the business of the chair. It will fall within 
the line of his duty to keep up that connection and 
correspondence with you, which has heretofore been 
mine; and I sincerely hope he may do it, as well as 
discharge every other duty incident to the office, 
with more advantage than I have done. Upon the 
review, however, of the intercourse that has subsisted 
between us, I cannot avoid saying, that I feel a 
great degree of pleasure in having, to the utmost of 
my power, endeavoured to execute the business committed to my care, and in a particular manner with 
regard to the army under your command. I flatter 
myself my conduct, in this instance, will meet with 
your approbation. The politeness and attention I have 
ever experienced from you, in the course of our correspondence, will always be a source of the most pleasing satisfaction to me. 
</p><p>
As it is probable I shall meet with some difficulty 
in crossing the North River, and shall run a considerable risk in passing through some Tory towns 
on the east side, I must ask the favor of you to 
give me authority to order a few light-horse from 
thence, to escort me through that part of the country. I apprehend I may safely go from hence to the 
North River, though I should be happy in having 
your opinion, and as to the best route. 
</p><p>
On my arrival in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, I shall think myself happy to be favored with any commands from you; and 
should any thing of a public nature occur, I will do 
myself the honor of letting you hear from me. 
</p><p>
With the most sincere wishes that you may soon 
triumph over the enemies of America, and meet with 
every public and private prosperity, and with the ut 
most respect, I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
