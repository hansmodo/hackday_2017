SIR, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of receiving, yesterday, yours of 
the 19th, containing the agreeable information of the 
Ministerial troops having abandoned <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. The 
partial victory we have obtained over them, in that 
quarter, I hope will turn out a happy presage of a 
more general one. Whatever place may be the object of their destination, it must certainly give a sincere pleasure to every friend of this country, to see 
the most diligent preparations everywhere making to 
receive them. What may be their views, it is in 
deed impossible to tell with any degree of exactness. 
We have all the reason, however, from the rage of 
disappointment and revenge, to expect the worst. 
Nor have I any doubt that, as far as their power 
extends, they will inflict every species of calamity 
upon us. The same <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> that has baffled their 
attempt against the Province of Massachusetts Bay 
will, I trust, defeat the deep-laid scheme they are 
now meditating against some other part of our country. 
</p><p>
The intelligence that our army had got possession 
of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, you will readily suppose gave me heart 
felt pleasure. I beg/ Sir, you will he pleased to accept my warmest thanks for the attention you have 
showed to my property in that town. I have only 
to request that Captain Cazneau will continue to 
look after it, and take care that it be no ways destroyed or damaged. 
</p><p>
This success of our arms naturally calls on me to 
congratulate you, Sir, to whose wisdom and conduct 
it has been owing. Permit me to add, that, if a 
constant discharge of the most important duties, and 
the fame attending thereon, can afford genuine satis 
faction, the pleasure you feel must be the most rational and exalted. 
</p><p>
I have it in charge from Congress to direct, that 
you send an account of the troops in your camp, 
who are deficient in arms, to the several Assemblies 
or Conventions of the Colonies to which those men 
belong, and request them to send a sufficient number of arms for the men coining from the respective 
Colonies ; and that, if arms cannot be procured, such 
as have not arms be dismissed the service. 
</p><p>
The Congress being of opinion, that the reduction 
of Quebec and the general security of the Province 
of Canada, are objects of great concern, I am commanded to direct that you detach four battalions 
into Canada from the army under your command, as 
soon as you shall be of opinion, that the safety of 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and the Eastern service will permit. 
</p><p>
Your several letters are at this time under the 
consideration of a Committee. As soon as any determination is made thereon, I will immediately for 
ward it to you. I have the honor to be, with the 
greatest esteem, Sir, your most obedient and very 
humble servant, 
</p><p>
