</p><p>
DEAR SIR: My recollection having been called to a letter received from 
the Hon. W. H. Crawford in- July, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1830">1830</a>, wherein he asks my attention to 
"circumstances that transpired during the cabinet deliberations on the 
events of the Seminole war," and my reply thereto: It is proper for me 
to state, that I answered <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> as though he alluded to transactions which took place while I was in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Monroe's</a> cabinet; but, since 
my arrival here this session, I learn, for the first time, that the cabinet 
meeting alluded to by Mr. Crawford, was held after I retired from the 
cabinet. I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>, in company with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">President Monroe</a> and 
yourself, for Norfolk, by the way of Annapolis, on the 28th May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>. 
Now, Sir, I do not pretend to know one word of what was said or done at 
any subsequent meeting; and I do therefore disclaim and say that my letter in answer to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> must not be interpreted so as to affirm or 
deny any cabinet transactions which took place after I left the cabinet. 
</p><p>
It is difficult for me to account how I could have blended other things, so 
as to connect them with events of which I could know nothing. It is a long time since those things occurred, and memory is treacherous; and that, 
I beg you to believe, is the only reason of the misapprehension on my part, 
</p><p>
I am, with high consideration, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bwc" rel="me">B. W. CROWNINSHIELD</a> 
</p><p>
Hon. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">J. C. CALHOUN</a>, Vice President. 
</p>
