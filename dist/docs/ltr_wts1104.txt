My Dear Brother : The steamer sails to-day, and will 
bring you news of the same character as the two past. 
The Vigilance Committee is in full blast, still exercises 
entire control, has Judge Terry in their power, and had 
the man Hopkins died, they would have hung him. 
Now the probabilities are they will send him away. 
Where the matter is to end, I cannot imagine, but I 
think the community is getting sick and disgusted with 
their secrecy, their street fools, and parades, and mock 
trials, worse, far worse, than the prompt, rapid executions of a mob or lynch court.

Since my resignation I have kept purposely aloof from 
all parties, either one way or the other; being in a business where large interests are at stake, I cannot act with 
that decision otherwise that would suit me. I do not 
think there is any necessity for the interference of the 
federal authorities, but that before we can hear from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> the matter will be over and forgotten.
