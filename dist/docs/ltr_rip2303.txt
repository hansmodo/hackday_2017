Headquarters, 25th February, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1779">1779</a>.
</p><p>
SIR,
</p><p>
The general wishes you to detain the best officers and men, for five
complete parties of sixty: and, as soon as Major Hull can be made
acquainted with your posts, and the nature of your command, he desires
you will ride up to headquarters if there is no probability of a
movement from below, and he will concert with you such measures as
shall be thought expedient.
</p><p>
The combustible balls are not yet come to hand. Five or six boxes of
ammunition will be sent down to Tarrytown by water the first
opportunity. 'Tis necessary that Dr Eustis, if not at the Plains,
should be sent for.
</p><p>
I am your obedient servant,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rip" rel="met">Richard Platt</a>, Aid-de-camp.
</p><p>
P.S.--Please to inform the general whether Colonel Poor's men have
accomplished the business they were sent upon or not.
</p>
