Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter, by the return express, I had the honor 
to receive, at three o'clock, this morning. It would 
have given me pleasure, had a residence at my house 
met with your approbation. 
</p><p>
I observe you had proposed taking an early dinner 
at <a href='/results.php?city=watertown' rel='city'>Watertown</a>, and proceeding to <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, and from 
thence to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, on Saturday afternoon. I beg leave, 
if it should not interfere with your determination, or 
prove inconvenient, to request that you would so far 
vary your former intention, as to arrive in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> by 
one o'clock. In case this request should meet your 
approbation, I beg the favor that you, with the gentlemen of your suite, would honor me with your 
company at dinner on Saturday en famiUe, at any 
hour that the circumstances of the day will admit. 
</p><p>
I shall esteem it an honor, if you will favor me 
with a few lines, by the return express, with your 
determination on the subject. I have the honor to 
be, with every sentiment of esteem and respect. Sir, 
</p><p>
Your very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">John Hancock</a>.
