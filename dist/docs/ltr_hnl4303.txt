My dear General,

You desired to hear from me, now and then, when I left Virginia. I obey your wishes with pleasure, and must assure you that I continue to feel the same 
unabating zeal to administer to your happiness which my public duty formerly commanded from me. I wish that my communications may be always agreeable. I apprehend your solicitude for the honor and 
prosperity of a nation formed under your auspices, 
will illy relish intelligence ominous of its destruction. 
But, so circumstanced is the Federal Government, that 
its death cannot be very far distant, unless immediate and adequate exertions are made by the several 
States.

The period is hurrying on, when no longer delay 
can be permitted. The late returns from the Continental Receivers, in the different States, prove unanimity in one point among the members of the Union, 
â€” no money. Congress, impressed with the lamentable effects which await the United States, from their 
adherence to temporary and disunited exertions, again 
have addressed the States. I inclose it. If success 
attends, we may divert the evils which menace our 
existence, and may still enjoy that happiness which 
we so arduously contended for. But, should the same 
supineness continue in our counsels, and jealousy, instead of patriotism, direct the measures of our Governments, consequences most distressing must certainly ensue. Part of the principal of our foreign 
loans is due next year, and no certain means yet devised to pay even the interest. 
</p><p>
Our agents have arrived in Morocco and Algiers, 
and we have some hopes that their negotiations may 
be successful. 
</p><p>
It is very doubtful, how our Commissioners may 
succeed with the Indians. We have too much reason 
to fear a war, which, among other evils, will increase 
our finance embarrassments. People here are very 
inquisitive about the progress of the Potomac navigation. The moment that business wears the prospect 
of certainty, rich emigrants from all the Eastern 
States will flock, to our towns. The Assembly of this 
State are in session, and will emit two hundred thousand pounds in paper. They are violent enemies to 
the impost; and, I fear, even the impending and approaching dangers to the existence of the Union will 
not move them. Please to present my respects to 
Mrs. Washington, and accept the best wishes of
