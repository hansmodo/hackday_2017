<a rel='month origin' value='7'>July</a> <a rel='day origin' value='25'>25th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. Now we are in a cottage rented from Doctor Chisolm. <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> is a full general. <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Johnston</a> has been removed and superseded. Early is threatening Washington City. Semmes, of whom we have been so proud, risked the 
Alabama in a sort of duel of ships. He has lowered the flag of the famous Alabama to the Kearsarge. Forgive who 
may ! I can not. We moved into this house on the 20th of July. My husband was telegraphed to go to Charleston. 
General Jones sent for him. A part of his command is on the coast.

The girls were at my house. Everything was in the utmost confusion. We were lying on a pile of mattresses 
in one of the front rooms while the servants were reducing things to order in the rear. All the papers are down on the 
President for this change of commanders except the Georgia papers. Indeed, Governor Brown's constant complaints, I 
dare say, caused it these and the rage of the Georgia people as <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Johnston</a> backed down on them.

Isabella soon came. She said she saw the Preston sisters pass her house, and as they turned the corner there was 
a loud and bitter cry. It seemed to come from the Hampton house. Both girls began to run at full speed. " What is 
the matter? " asked Mrs. Martin. " Mother, listen; that sounded like the cry of a broken heart," said Isabella; 
" something has gone terribly wrong at the PrestonsV

Mrs. Martin is deaf, however, so she heard nothing and thought Isabella fanciful. Isabella hurried over there, and 
learned that they had come to tell Mrs. Preston that Willie was killed Willie ! his mother's darling. No country ever 
had a braver soldier, a truer gentleman, to lay down his life in her cause.
