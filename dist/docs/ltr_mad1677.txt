DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 4th ult. by Col. Lee was received from his hands on Sunday last. I have since received 
that of the 3d instant. The antecedent one from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">ALEXANDRIA</a>, 
though long on the way, was received some time before. In all 
these, I discover strong marks of the dissatisfaction with which 
you behold our public prospects. Though in several respects 
they do not comport with my wishes, yet I cannot feel all the 
despondency which you seem to give way to. I do not mean 
that I entertain much hope of the Potowmac; that seems pretty 
much out of sight; but that other measures in view, however 
improper, will be less fatal than you imagine.

The plan of discrimination has met with the reception in 
Virginia on which I calculated. The towns would for obvious 
reasons disrelish it, and for a time they always set public 
opinion. The country in this region of America,, in general, if 
I am not misinformed, has not been in unison with the cities, 
</p><p>
I think with you that the Report of the Secretary of the 
Treasury is faulty in many respects; it departs particularly 
from that simplicity which ought to be preserv. in finance 
more than anything else. The novelty and difficulty of the task 
he had to execute form no small apology for his errors, and I 
am in hopes that in some instances they will be diminished, if 
not remedied. 
</p><p>
The proposed assumption of the State debts has undergone 
repeated discussions and contradictory decisions. The last 
vote was taken yesterday in a Committee of the whole, and 
passed in the negative, 31 vs. 29. The minority do not abandon, however, their object, and tis impossible to foretell the 
final destiny of the measure. It has some good aspects, and 
under some modifications would be favorable to the pecuniary 
interests of Virginia, and not inconsistent with the general 
principle of. justice. In any attainable form it would have 
neither of these recommendations, and is, moreover, liable to 
strong objections of a general nature. It would certainly be 
wrong to force an affirmative decision on so important and controvertible a point by a bare majority, yet I have little hope of 
forbearance from that scruple. Massachusetts and S. Carolina, 
with their allies of Connecticut and N. York, are too zealous 
to be arrested in their project, unless by the force of an adverse 
majority. 
</p><p>
I have received your reflections on the subject of a public 
debt with pleasure. In general they are, in my opinion, just 
and important. Perhaps it is not possible to shun some of the 
evils you point out, without abandoning too much the re-establishment of public credit. But as far as this object will permit, 
I go on the principle that a public debt is a public curse, and in 
a Republican Government a greater than in any other.
