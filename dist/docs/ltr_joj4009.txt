Dear General, 
</p><p>
I hope you will seriously determine to serve your country, 
at least in a legislative capacity. Class yourself with those 
great men of antiquity, who, unmoved by the ingratitude 
of their country, omitted no opportunities of promoting the 
public weal. In this field malice cannot prevent your 
reaping laurels, and remember that the present state of our 
affairs offers you a plentiful harvest. Set about it then, my 
dear sir, in earnest. I know not w T ho will be the bearer of 
this letter, and therefore forbear enlarging. 
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
