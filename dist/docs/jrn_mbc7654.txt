<a rel='month origin' value='7'>July</a> <a rel='day origin' value='1'>1st</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. No more news. It has settled down into this. The general battle, the decisive battle, has to be fought yet. Edward Cheves, only son of John Cheves, killed. His sister kept crying, " Oh, mother, what shall 
we do; Edward is killed," but the mother sat dead still, white as a sheet, never uttering a word or shedding a tear. 
Are our women losing the capacity to weep. The father came to-day pMfT John Cheves. "He Has been making infernal machines in Charleston to blow up Yankee ships. "

While Mrs. McCord was telling me of this terrible trouble in her brother's family, some one said: " Decca's 
husband died of grief." Stuff and nonsense; silly sentiment, folly! If he is not wounded, he is alive. His 
brother, John, may die of that shattered arm in this hot weather. Alex will never die of a broken heart. Take my word for it.
