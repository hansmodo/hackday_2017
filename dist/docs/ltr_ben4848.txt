SIR : I thank you for the pamphlets proposing to establish 
Life Annuities in Parishes, &c. I think it an excellent one. 
In compliance with your wish, pages 25, 26, I send it back 
with a few marginal notes (perhaps of no great importance) 
made in reading it, requesting it may be returned to me. 
</p><p>
In page 118 of Dr. Price's book on Annuities, 2d edition, 
you will find mention made of an institution in Holland. 
He had that information from me. Those houses are handsome, neat buildings, with very comfortable apartments. 
Some form the sides of a square, with grass-plots and gravel 
walks, flowers, &c., and some have little separate gardens 
behind each apartment. Those for men are called Oude 
Mannen Huyzen; for women, Oude Vrouwen Huyzen. 
I think the different kinds sometimes make different sides 
of the same square. There is a chapel for prayers, a common 
kitchen, and a common hall in which they dine together. 
Two persons, such as best like one another, and choose so 
to associate, are generally lodged in one apartment, though in separate beds, that they may be at hand to assist each other 
in case of sudden illness in the night, and otherwise be mutually helpful. 
</p><p>
The Directors have also a room to meet in, who form rules, 
for the government of the house, hear complaints, and rectify 
what is amiss. Gentlemen are directors of the Oude Mannen 
Huyzen, ladies of the Oude Vrouwen Huyzen. A committee 
of two are chosen every year, who visit often, see the rules 
observed, and take care of the management. At the end of 
the year these are thanked off, and as an honourable memorial 
of their services, their names, with the year they served, are 
added to the Gold Letter List on the walls of the room. All 
the furniture is neat and convenient, the beds and rooms 
kept clean and sweet by the servants of the house ; and the 
people appear to live happily. 
</p><p>
These institutions seem calculated to prevent poverty, 
which is rather a better thing than relieving it. For it keeps 
always in the public eye a state of comfort and repose in old 
age, with freedom from care held forth as an encouragement 
to so much industry and frugality in youth as may at least serve 
to raise the required sum (suppose 50) that is to entitle a 
man or a woman at fifty to a retreat in those houses. And 
in acquiring this sum habits may be acquired that produce 
such affluence before that age arrives, as to make the retreat 
unnecessary and so never claimed. Hence if 50 would 
(as by your table) entitle a man at fifty years of age to an 
annuity of 19,3,6^, I suppose that in such a house, entertainment, and accommodations to a much greater value might 
be afforded him ; because the right to live there is not transferable, and therefore every unclaimed right is an advantage to 
the house, while annuities would probably all be claimed. 
Then it seems to me that the prospect of a distant annuity 
will not be so influencing on the minds of young people, as 
the constant view of the comfort enjoyed in those houses, 
in comparison of which the payment and receipt of the annuities are private transactions. 
</p><p>
I write this in hopes you will, after consideration, favour 
me with your opinion whether (in addition to your plan, 
which will still have all advantages for smaller sums) one or 
more such houses in every county, would not probably be 
of great use in still farther promoting industry and frugality 
among the lower people and of course lessening the enormous 
weight of the poor- tax? 
</p><p>
I enclose a little piece I wrote in America, to encourage 
and strengthen those important virtues, of which I beg your 
acceptance, and am, with great esteem, Sir, your most 
</p><p>
obedient and humble Servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
