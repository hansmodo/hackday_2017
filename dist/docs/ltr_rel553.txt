<i>[Biographer's note: The people of Virginia and of the entire South were continually giving
evidence of their intense love for General Lee.  From all nations,
even from the Northern States, came to him marks of admiration and
respect.  Just at this time he received many applications for his
photograph with autograph attached.  I believe there were none of the
little things in life so irksome to him as having his picture taken
in any way, but, when able to comply, he could not refuse to do what
was asked of him by those who were willing and anxious to do so much
for him.</i>

<i>In the following letter the photographs referred to had been sent to
him for his signature, from a supply that my mother generally kept on
hand.  She was often asked for them by those who very considerately
desired to save my father the trouble:]</i>

My Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse sweetheart met">Mary</a>:  I have just received your letter of the 17th, and return
the photographs with my signatures.  I wrote to you by the boat of
yesterday morning.  I also sent you a packet of letters by Captain
Wilkinson [commander of the canal packet], which also ought to have
reached you to-day.  I have nothing to add to my former letters, and
only write now that you may receive the photos before you leave.  I
answered Agnes' letter immediately, and inclosed her several letters.
I was in hopes she had made up her mind to eschew weddings and stick
to her pap.  I do not think she can help little Sallie.  Besides, she
will not take the oath--how can she get married?  The wedding party
from this place go down in the boat to-night to Lynchburg--Miss
Williamson and Captain Eoff.  They are to be married in church at
eight P. M. and embark at eleven.  I wish them a pleasant passage
and am glad I am not of the party.  The scenery along the river will
no doubt be cheering and agreeable.  I think the repairs of the house
will be completed this week; should the furniture arrive, it will be
habitable next.  The weather is still beautiful, which is in our
favour.  I am glad Caroline is so promising.  I have engaged no servant
here yet, nor have I found one to my liking.  we can get some of some
kind, and do better when we can.  I have heard nothing of the wedding
at 'Belmead,' and do not think Preston will go.  Mrs. Cocke is very
well, but the furniture she intends for your room is not yet completed.
It will be more comfortable and agreeable to you to go at once to the
house on your arrival.  But if there is anything to make it more
desirable for you to come before the house is ready, you must come to
the hotel.  If we could only get comfortable weather in December, it
would be better not to go into the house until it is dry, the paint
hard, etc.  It will require all this week to get the wood done; then
it must be scoured, etc., and the furniture properly arranged.  Tell
Rob he will soon be well.  He must cheer up and come and see his papa.
Give my love to Mrs. Cocke, Miss Mary, etc., etc.  Tell Agnes, if she
thinks Sallie is IN EXTREMIS, to go to her.  I do not want her to pass
away, but it is a great disappointment to me not to have her with me.
I am getting very old and infirm now, and she had better come to her
papa and take care of him.

                        Most affectionately yours,  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="me">R. E. Lee.</a>.
