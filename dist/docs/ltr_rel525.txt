<p><i>[In the next letter to my mother he describes a visit to the grave of
his father at Dungeness, on Cumberland Island, Georgia.  Dungeness was
presented to General Nathaniel Green by the State of Georgia for
services rendered her in the Revolution.  General Henry Lee, returning
from the West Indies, where he had been for some months on account
of his health, landed there, and in a few days died, March 15, 1818.
He was most kindly cared for by the daughter of his old commander,
and was buried there in the garden of Dungeness.  At the time of my
father's visit the place belonged to a great-nephew of General Green,
Mr. Nightingale.]</i>

On my return, day before yesterday, from Florida, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse sweetheart met">Mary</a>, I received
your letter of the 1st inst.  I am very glad to find that you had a
pleasant family meeting Christmas, and that it was so large.  I am
truly grateful for all the mercies we enjoy, notwithstanding the
miseries of war, and join heartily in the wish that the next year may
find us at peace with all the world.  I am delighted to hear that our
little grandson [his first grandchild--son of my brother Fitzhugh.  He
died in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1863">1863</a>] is improving so fast and is becoming such a perfect
gentleman.  May his path be strewn with flowers and his life with
happiness.  I am very glad to hear also that his dear papa is promoted.
It will be gratifying to him and increase, I hope, his means of
usefulness.  Robert wrote me he saw him on his way through
Charlottesville with his squadron, and that he was well.  While at
Fernandina I went over to Cumberland Island and walked up to
'Dungeness,' the former residence of General Green.  It was my first
visit to the house, and I had the gratification at length of visiting
my father's grave.  He died there, you may recollect, on his way from
the West Indies, and was interred in one corner of the family cemetery.
The spot is marked by a plain marble slab, with his name, age, and her
daughter, Mrs. Shaw, and her husband.  The place is at present owned
by Mr. Nightingale, nephew of Mrs. Shaw, who married a daughter of
Mr. James King.  The family have moved into the interior of Georgia,
leaving only a few servants and a white gardener on the place.  The
garden was beautiful, inclosed by the finest hedge I have ever seen.
It was of the wild olive, which, in Mrs. Shaw's lifetime, during my
tour of duty in Savannah in early life, was so productive, had been
destroyed by an insect that has proved fatal to the orange on the coast
of Georgia and Florida.   There was a fine grove of olives, from which,
I learn, Mr. Nightingale procures oil.  The garden was filled with roses
and beautiful vines, the names of which I do not know.  Among them
was the tomato-vine in full bearing, with the ripe fruit on it.  There
has yet been no frost in that region of country this winter.  I went
in the dining-room and parlour, in which the furniture still
remained....  The house has never been finished, but is a fine, large
one and beautifully located.  A magnificent grove of live-oaks envelops
the road from the landing to the house....  Love to everybody and God
bless you all.

                       Truly and faithfully yours,
