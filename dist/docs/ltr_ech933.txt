My Ellen:--A year has passed since I held thy hand and bid thee a sad adieu. What a short time! Yet how
many trials, difficulties and dangers have we passed through during that time! How many midnight hours have we spent upon a sleepless pillow, thinking of each other and perhaps building castles in the air which have as soon passed away as they were created, without any evidence that they ever existed except that we feel in our own disappointment. But do not let us get to musing too much on the past or we shall become melancholy, but let us trust on and look to the future.
</p><p>
As you will see by the date of this letter, I have journeyed to Sonora. I left all my letters in my trunk when I came here on horseback from Stockton, in care of a gentleman who promised to forward it to me next morning.

I have received nothing from you since your letter of March 5th. Your letters are of the utmost importance and were I to be as unfortunate as Theodore in not receiving any for a whole year, I don't know what I should do. You say you cherish a letter from me. Then how much more must I cherish a letter from you? You are surrounded by old associations. I am in a strange land among strangers, battling hard to climb the mountain now before me.
</p><p>
I can well appreciate your caution when you say that should I be among the unlucky ones, I must not be discouraged but return to those who love me devoutly and let well enough alone. I will return--but when? Some time since, rather a dark cloud obscured my vision, but it has cleared away and a bright sunshine now plays upon me. I am doing much better, having found employment at my trade at a good salary.

Poor Clint truly has had a tough time of it. He has been sick ever since his arrival in the country until within a few weeks. He has not as yet worked more
than two or three days, but proposes going at it this week. In his long and severe illness, I expected to see him die any day for a long time, but he now reports himself quite well. This removes a great weight off my shoulders.
</p><p>
Last night I lay down to sleep and dreamed that you were here but when I first beheld you, you were just being married to another. I thought I looked on with indifference at first but soon got much perplexed. When I awoke I was chagrined that we were so far apart, yet rejoiced to realize that you were still my own.
</p><p>
Write me often.
</p><p>
God bless you.
