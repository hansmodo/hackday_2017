My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your esteemed & interesting letter of the 25th  inst has just reached 
me & I hardly need say how much gratification it afforded us to hear you, 
Ann & the girls were all well, & when last heard from the boys were in 
good health, & getting on as well as could be expected 
</p><p>
I returned last night from a trip to Woodville to which place I had 
determined on going for some time past but was prevented from doing so 
for several weeks by an attack of neuralgic affection in my leg, which I 
mentioned to you in my last communication ; alth not entirely recoverd 
I left home last Sunday was a week, & alth the weather was quite unfavorable, I succeeded in getting through with the undertaking with but 
little inconvenience, & got back if not entirely recovered in greatly 
improved health ; at any rate able to get about without the aid of a 
crutch or a cane I have but little doubt the change from a very active, 
to an inactive life, may in some measure have aided in bringing on the 
attack from which I experienced so much inconvenience; but I do not 
believe that too high living at Baton Rouge, or indulging too freely in 
the plain diet which every one here are from necessity of confining them 
selves to, had much to do in bringing on the same; however I trust I will 
escape from a return of the same, or any similar disease, at any rate for 
some time to come

The communication referred to by Mr Hunt addressed to me & 
signed by several members of Congress wishing me to define more clearly 
my position than I have heretofore done, I have just rec d by Col Van Allen 
the gentleman who carried despatches to me from the war dept just as I 
was leaving Mexico; he was also the bearer of an invitation from the 
Senate & House of Representatives of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">N. York</a> through Governor Young 
to visit that state, which as a matter of course I must decline ; & I must 
in a great measure if not alltogather decline going father in explaining my 
views on political matters than I have already done ; I now feel perfectly 
satisfied the contest for the presidency will sittle down so far as the office 
seekers & trading politicians are concerned of both the great parties to a 
strict party vote ; in which I do not wish to be concerned ; the contest, 
should an independent or third party spring up between now & the first 
Monday of Nov r next will be between them & the politicians ; but 
whether the former will be able to contend successfully with the latter the 
result must determine ; I much fear the devotion of a portion of the Whigs 
would rather be defeated with Mr Clay as their candidate than to succeed 
with any one else, such is devotion to a party which absorbs every other 
consideration; but if the present party in power is saddled on the country 
the responsibility will be with Mr Clay & his Whig friends 
</p><p>
I was gratified to know the convention which met on the 22 d to 
nominate Taylor Electors for the presidency passed off with so much 
unanimity & good feeling & without drawing strict party lines; had my 
friends in other states done likewise the result I think would not be 
doubtful. Majr Eaton & lady are here; he brings no news of importance. 
I am indebted to Majr Sumner 1 for his kind regards. Jarvis no doubt 
gives you a faithful picture of Gen Wool, & his proceedings, it may be 
truly said of him, he is a "little great man" 
</p><p>
I am pleased to hear you have put Wesley under medical treatment, 
& flatter myself his case is not beyond the reach of medicine, & that he 
will soon be so far recovered as to return to the plantation On the 
subject of the horses, I would prefer if an other course has not been 
adopted, the receipts to be made out in Dicks name, but if they have been 
in mine, I will will sign them on their reaching me, & immediately return 
them I deeply regret to hear of the fate of poor Conrad, as well as 
the violent death of Dr Glen, but you do not say how or by whom the 
latter came to his end 
</p><p>
All things considered you did wisely in declining the charge of the 
U. S. Gen Hospital to be established in or near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> on acct of 
the unhealthiness of the position, but even that would be preferable to 
going to Mexico, & be seperated from your family ; if you can get 
a pleasant Northern or Eastern station it will be more desirable, particularly on account of educating the girls ; but if you have to remain in the 
South I still entertain the opinion if it can be possibly done, it it would 
be better to keep a teacher or governess in the house as being more economical as well as the most judicious course which could be pursued ; 
however we must do the best we can as regards such matters. Either of 
the stations named by you would be most desirable

While at Woodville I met with an old brother officer who I served 
with soon after entering the army Col W m S. Hamilton who informed me 
a young son of his about 18 years of age, Franklin Hamilton who he 
sent to Ohio had joined one of the Volunteer Regt s from that state & went 
with it to Mexico by the way of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a>, that he had not heard from 
him for some time which caused him great uneasiness ; & as volunteers were sent out of the country to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> very frequently sick, he 
might chance to be among the number ; & wished me to make som 
inquiries about him which I promised to do ; I have therefore to request 
you to examine & see if he is among the sick who have been sent to 
the Hospital under your charge, or may reach there hereafter, in either 
case I hope you will pay him every attention in your power to bestow 
until he is able to join his family 
</p><p>
I intend going to my plantation in 5 or six days where I expect to remain until the latter part of March

Mrs Taylors health is improving Betty is not very well, but is about, 
they join me in love to Ann & the girls & wishing you & yours continued 
health & prosperity remain your
