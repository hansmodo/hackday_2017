MY DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
I have just received your letter sent by the General 
Green, Capt. Sheldon, via Rhode Island, dated August 27th. I believe I have scarcely lost a letter 
from you or your brother, notwithstanding the many 
hazards and chances to which they have been liable. 
Accept my thanks for your last communications. 
</p><p>
I rejoice at the return of your health, strength and 
spirits ; and most sincerely wish that your constitution may be mended by the ordeal you have passed. 
</p><p>
I have much upon my mind which I could say to 
you ; prudence forbids my committing it to writing. 
At this eventful period, I can judge of your solicitude 
to learn, through a channel upon which you could 
depend, whatever affects the interests of our country. 
In a quotation from the Chronicle you cannot expect 
truth. Falsehood and malevolence are its strongest 
features. It is the offspring of faction, and nursed bysedition, the adopted bantling of party. It has been 
crying monarchy and aristocracy, and vociferating 
anathemas against the " Defence," as favouring monarchy ; and making quotations of detached sentences, 
as the atheist endeavoured to prove from scripture 
that " there is no God," by omitting, " the fool hath 
said in his heart." 
</p><p>
One writer asserts, that " <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> has immortalized himself as an advocate for hereditary government, 
as much as <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='friend met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> has distinguished himself, 
in and out of office, as a true republican. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> 
has sons placed in high offices, and who are, no doubt, 
understood to be what he calls the well-born, and 
who, following his own principle, may as he hopes, 
one time become the seigneurs or lords of this country. <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='friend met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> has daughters only, and had he 
the wish, has no male successor." 
</p><p>
By such false and glaring absurdities do these miserable beings endeavour to deceive and delude the 
people into a distrust of their most disinterested 
friends, the real guardians of their liberties and defenders of their privileges. 
</p><p>
I feel anxious for the fate of my country. If the 
administration should get into hands which would 
depart from the system under which we have enjoyed 
so great a share of peace, prosperity and happiness, 
we should soon be involved in the wars and calamities which have deluged other nations in blood. We 
should soon become a divided and a miserable people. 
I have been too long a witness to the scenes which 
have been acted for years past, and know too well 
what must be endured, to have any other sensations, 
when I look to an elevated seat, than painful solicitude and anxiety. It is a mark at which envy, pride 
and malevolence will shoot their envenomed arrows. 
Joy dwells in these dear silent shades at <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a> ; 
and domestic pleasures, in peace and tranquillity. If 
I should be called to quit you, with what regret shall 
I part from you. 
</p><p>
I feel perhaps too keenly the abuse of party. 
Washington endured it ; but he had the support of 
the people and their undiminished confidence to the 
hour of his resignation, and a combination of circumstances which no other man can look for. First, a 
unanimous choice. Secondly, personally known to 
more people by having commanded the armies, than 
any other man. Thirdly, possessed of a large landed 
estate. Fourthly, refusing all emoluments of office 
both in his military and civil capacity. Take his 
character all together, and we shall not look upon his 
like again ; notwithstanding which, he was reviled 
and abused, his administration perplexed, and his 
measures impeded. What is the expected lot of a 
successor ? He must be armed as Washington was 
with integrity, with firmness, with intrepidity. These 
must be his shield and his wall of brass ; and religion too, or he never will be able to stand sure and 
steadfast. Dr. Priestley, in a dedication of some sermons which he delivered last winter, and which he 
dedicated to the Vice President of the United States, 
observes to him, " that religion is of as much use to a 
statesman as to any individual whatever ; for christian principles will best enable men to devote their 
time, their lives, their talents, and what is often a 
greater sacrifice, their characters, to the public good ; 
and in public life, he observes, this will often be in a 
great measure necessary. Let a man attain to eminence of any kind, and by whatever means, even the 
most honorable, he will be exposed to envy and jealousy. And of course he must expect to meet w r ith 
calumny and abuse. What principles can enable a 
man to consult the real good of his fellow citizens 
without being diverted from his generous purpose by 
a regard to their opinion concerning him, like those 
of the christian who can be satisfied with the approbation of his own mind, and who, though not insensible to due praise, can despise calumny, and steadily 
overlooking every thing which is intermediate, patiently wait for the day of final retribution ? " 
Thus says the Poet ; 
</p><p>
" Fame for good deeds is the reward of virtue ; 
Thirst after fame is given us by the gods 
Both to excite our minds to noble acts, 
And give a proof of some immortal state, 
Where we shall know that Fame we leave behind, 
That highest blessing which the jjods bestow." 
</p><p>
As I consider it one of my chief blessings to have 
sons worthy of the confidence of their country, so I 
hope, in imitation of their father, they will serve it 
with honor and fidelity, and with consciences void 
of offence ; and though they may sometimes meet 
with ingratitude, they will have 
</p><p>
" The soul's calm sunshine and the heart- felt joy." 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear son. I hope to see you in the 
course of another year. Time, which improves 
youth, every year furrows the brow of age. 
</p><p>
" Our years 
As life declines, speed rapidly away ; 
And not a year but pilfers, as he goes, 
Some youthful grace that age would gladly keep, 
A tooth or auburn lock." 
</p><p>
Thus, my son, in the course of three years 
absence, you will find many depredations of time 
upon those whom you left advanced in life, and in 
none more, perhaps, than in your mother, whose 
frequent indispositions hasten its strides and impair a 
frail fabric. But neither time, absence nor sickness 
have lessened the warmth of her affection for her 
dear children, which will burn with undiminished 
fervour until the lamp of life is extinguished together 
with the name of 
</p><p>
Abigail Adams.
