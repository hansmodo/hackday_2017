<a rel='month origin' value='4'>April</a> <a rel='day origin' value='6'>6th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city origin'>CHARLESTON</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. The plot thickens, the air is red hot with rumors; the mystery is to find out where these utterly 
groundless tales originate. In spite of all, Tom Huger came for us and we went on the Planter to take a look 
at Morris Island and its present inhabitants Mrs. Wigf all and the Cheves girls, Maxcy Gregg and Colonel Whiting, 
also John Rutledge, of the Navy, Dan Hamilton, and William Haskell. John Rutledge was a figurehead to be proud 
of. He did not speak to us. But he stood with a Scotch shawl draped about him, as handsome and stately a creature as ever Queen Elizabeth loved to look upon.

There came up such a wind we could not land. I was not too sorry, though it blew so hard (I am never seasick). 
Colonel Whiting explained everything about the forts, what they lacked, etc., in the most interesting way, and Maxcy 
Gregg supplemented his report by stating all the deficiencies and shortcomings by land.

<a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> is a demigod here to most of the natives, but there are always seers who see and say. They give 
you to understand that Whiting has all the brains now in use for our defense. He does the work and <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> 
reaps the glory. Things seem to draw near a crisis. And one must think. Colonel Whiting is clever enough for 
anything, so we made up our minds to-day, Maxcy Gregg and I, as judges. Mr. Gregg told me that my husband was 
in a minority in the Convention; so much for cool sense when the atmosphere is phosphorescent. Mrs. Wigfall says 
we are mismatched. She should pair with my cool, quiet, self-poised Colonel. And her stormy petrel is but a male reflection of me.
