Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I intend to despatch Captain Culver tomorrow morning, and 
shall give into his charge a box containing three dies of medals, 
and three boxes containing each one pair of dies. Whether 
he will be able to take them to you is uncertain, owing to 
trifling circumstances. I have not yet got the passports for 
them ; and he tells me, that his vessel is in the basin at Havre,, 
consequently must come out at the present full tides, or stay a 
long time; so that, if I have not the passport in the morning, I 
will take the chance of sending it after him.

It appears that the French army has forced the Prince de 
Cobourg to raise the siege of Maubeuge ; but he has crossed 
the Sambre in good order, and perhaps we may soon hear of 
him again. Be that as it may, the French have experienced 
a complete defeat in Alsace. The lines of the Lauter have 
been forced, and they have lost everything. A great part 
of the army is cut to pieces, and the rest is we know not 
where.

I have been told that a plot for delivering up Strasbourg has 
been discovered, and that a great majority of the inhabitants 
are concerned in it. Also that serious apprehensions are yet 
entertained for the fate of that city. The advanced period of 
the season is, however, favorable to the party which is on the 
defensive in that quarter. November generally brings foul 
weather there ; so that the assailants must, I think, look out for 
winter quarters instead of pushing into the country. I am, &c.
