SIR, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to transmit, at this time, copies 
of the several letters from General Livingston and 
General Ducoudray to Congress. As Governor Livingston seems apprehensive of an irruption from the 
enemy on Staten Island, and says they are collecting 
there for this purpose, the Congress have directed 
<a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a> to hold in readiness fifteen hundred 
men, under the command of a Brigadier, to cross the 
North River when you may think proper to order it. 
A copy of the resolve I shall immediately forward 
to <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>. 
</p><p>
The inclosed letter, from Monsieur Ducoudray, contains a proposal of forming a camp between Wilmington and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, the propriety of which the 
Congress have referred entirely to you. Colonel Harrison's favor of the 7th instant was duly received. I 
beg leave to request your attention to the inclosures ; 
and have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, 
Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
