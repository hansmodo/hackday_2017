SIR: 
</p><p>
I received your letter by Mr. King on the 31st ult. I approve of 
your appointment of Capt. Milligan to the command of the galley, and 
have accordingly enclosed him a commission, and another blank for a 
lieutenant, to be appointed by Milligan himself, as I think one lieutenant sufficient for the present. You must, by some means or other, 
procure Mr. Moore a horse, to come up to me; if it can be done by no 
other means, you must dismount one of your dragoons, and furnish him 
with his horse, as I have business of a very particular nature to transact 
with that gentleman. I have no other instructions for Milligan than to 
use his best endeavors to guard the harbor of <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>. The State 
has at present no particular service to employ Capt. Putnam in. 
I am, sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

P.S. Col. Lushington informs me there is a Mr. Edward Hair lately arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, in a flag from Charlestown. This man's 
name is on the confiscation list, and is, of course, banished this State. You are, therefore, to order him immediately back to Charlestown, or 
at least within the enemy's lines, on pain of his incurring the pains and penalties of the Act before mentioned, if hereafter found within 
our lines. The same gentleman informs me there is one Wm. Graham, also within your command, who is looked upon as a dangerous person. 
If you should be of this opinion, give him the same orders you do Hair, for an authorised spy is the most dangerous enemy we can have to contend against.
