SIR: 
</p><p>
Col. Richardson acquaints me that there was some men who did not, 
or would not, submit to the terms sent you. All such men will be 
allowed to go to Charlestown, and be considered as prisoners of war, to 
be exchanged for the American prisoners. Their wives and children, 
and such property as is theirs, they will be allowed to take with them, 
except stock and arms, and shall be safely conducted to town on Saturday, or sooner, if possible. I shall be glad to see you at Mr. Burches .
