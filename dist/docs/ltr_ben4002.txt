Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have undertaken to pay all the bills of your acceptance 
that have come to my knowledge, and I hope in God no 
more will be drawn upon us, but when funds are first provided. In that case your constant residence at Madrid is 
no longer so necessary. You may make a journey either 
for health or pleasure, without retarding the progress of a 
negotiation not yet begun. Here you are greatly wanted, 
for messengers begin to come and go, and there is much 
talk of a treaty proposed, but I can neither make, nor agree 
to propositions of peace, without the assistance of my colleagues. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Adams</a>, I am afraid, cannot just now leave 
Holland. <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> is not in Europe, and <a href='/results.php?tla=hel' rel='colleague'>Mr. Laurens</a> 
is a prisoner, though abroad upon parol. I wish, therefore, 
that you would resolve upon the journey, and render yourself here as soon as possible. You would be of infinite 
service. Spain has taken four years to consider whether 
she should treat with us or not. Give her forty, and let us 
in the mean time mind our own business. I have much to 
communicate to you, but choose rather to do it viva voce, 
than trust it to letters. 
</p><p>
I am ever, my dear friend, 
</p><p>
Yours most affectionately, 
</p><p>
