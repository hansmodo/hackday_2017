My Worrying Little Agnes:  your letter of the 1st received to-night.
I have autographed the photographs and send a gross of the latter and
a lock of hair.  Present my love to the recipients and thank them for
their favours.  Sally is going to marry a widower.  I think I ought
to know, as she refused my son, and I do not wish to know his name.
I wonder if she knows how many children he has.  Tell Mr. Warwick I
am sorry for him.  I do not know what he will do without his sweet
daughter.  Nor do I know what I will do without her, either.  Your
mother has written--Mildred, too--and I presume has told you all
domestic news.  Custis is promenading the floor, Rob reading the
papers, and Mildred packing her dress.  Your mamma is up to her eyes
in news and I am crabbed as usual.  I miss you very much and hope
this is the last wedding you will attend.  Good-bye.  Love to everybody.

                 Your affectionate father,   <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="me">R. E. Lee.</a>.
