Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
By <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague met kin'>Colonel Hamilton</a>, who made me a visit at Albany
on the 26th instant, I had the pleasure of your favour of the 
16th September last. Persuaded you never convey sentiments to your friends, which flow merely from the head, 
and in which the heart does not participate, I have not 
words to express how pleasingly mine was affected in the 
perusal. 
</p><p>
I think I hear you wish to be advised of what is passing 
in your native country, at a juncture when the decisions of 
government must determine the philosophers and politicians 
of Europe to form their opinion of our wisdom or our folly. 
Having been exceedingly indisposed, I have not attended until a few days ago, and am consequently, as yet, not in a 
situation to speak decidedly ; but I have reason to apprehend, however, from the complexion of the members, that 
our conduct will be such as to afford occasion to the friend 
of mankind to drop a tear on the intemperance of mankind ; 
and to reflect, with pain, that a people who have hardly 
been emancipated from a threatened tyranny, forgetting 
how odious oppression appeared to them, begin to play the 
tyrant, and give a melancholy evidence, that however capable we were of bearing adversity with magnanimity, we 
are too weak to support, with propriety, the prosperity we 
have so happily experienced. 
</p><p>
I am led to this conclusion from observing that too many, 
not contented with a peace, glorious and advantageous 
beyond the expectations of the most sanguine real patriot, 
and that, too, obtained at a period when the complexion of 
our national affairs was alarming in the extreme, wish to 
evade the positive stipulations, few and inconsiderable as 
they are, in favour of those who adhered to Britain ; and 
carry their view even so far beyond that, as totally to 
deprive all those who remained within the power of the 
British troops from the rights of citizens, upon the false conclusion that all who remained in were zealous adherents to 
the then enemy, and all who were not, disinterested and real 
patriots. I think you and I could point out some who 
looked at both sides of the question whilst the contest was 
doubtful, and who probably did not wish it to terminate as 
it has done ; and yet these are the very characters who are 
now most vociferous against that set of people, to whom, 
but a few months before the annunciation of the provisional 
articles, they still paid court. I hope, however, when the 
present scramblers for the honours and the emoluments of 
the States are satisfied, that our affairs will take another 
turn, and that we shall not irretrievably lose our national 
character. Among those claimants and scramblers you 
will not include some whose zeal for the common cause, 
from the first stage of the contest to the close, are justly entitled to the attention of government â€” such as <a href='/results.php?tla=jad' rel='colleague'>Mr. Duane</a>, 
who has the mayoralty of this city, and some others. 
</p><p>
When I assure you that I am anxious for your speedy 
return to your native country, and that it is more than a 
selfish wish, I am very sincere ; for I believe your influence would tend much to promote its true interest. 
</p><p>
Permit me to entreat your lady to participate with you 
in wishes which come from the heart, for your health and 
happiness, and for your speedy and safe arrival on these 
shores where you will find friends who love and esteem 
you, and where all ought to revere you who are capable of 
being penetrated with gratitude for the most eminent services. For my part, I never think of you without emotions 
too delicate for communication. God bless you. 
</p><p>
I am, affectionately and sincerely, 
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
