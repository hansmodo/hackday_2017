Yesterday I dined at Mr. Bingham's with a large 
company. While at table a servant came to me with 
a message from Mr. Law, who desired to speak with 
me in the anti-chamber. I went out to him and 
found that he wanted to enquire of me concerning a 
young lady of amiable manners and elegant education, whom Mr. Law and Mr. Greenleaf had found 
in Maryland, in great distress and a little disarranged, 
and brought with them to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. She is connected with families in Marblehead. I knew nothing 
of her. Governor Bradford says she has been some 
weeks in Rhode Island. I sent Mr. Law to Mr. Cabot.

Mr. Brown came in yesterday. He keeps with all 
the horses at the Rising Sun, between the fourth 
and fifth milestone in the country, at Mr. John Dove's. 
His horses are in fine order, but I shall not be in a 
condition to use them this week, I fear.
