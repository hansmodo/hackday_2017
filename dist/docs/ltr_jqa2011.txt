DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I am at length released from the multiplicity of business 
which has employed so much of my time for the last eighteen months. During that period I had scarcely a leisure 
moment, and was forced to a degree of application which has 
been injurious to my health. But as I am left at present 
free from every employment, I shall have time to recruit, 
and I shall also be able to give more frequent testimonies 
of the attachment to my friends in Europe, who perhaps 
have just grounds to complain of my neglecting to write, 
notwithstanding all that I have offered for my justification. On the 2Oth of the present month I concluded my 
collegiate course and returned here, as the Senior class are 
always dismissed four weeks before Commencement. At 
an exhibition which took place at the beginning of April, I 
delivered the inclosed piece upon the profession of the law. 
Two of my classmates performed at the same time, one of 
which spoke upon physic and the other upon divinity. 
The comparative utility of these professions was the topic, 
and the performance was honored with the approbation of 
the audience. It may savour perhaps of vanity in me to 
mention this circumstance, and I should have said nothing 
of it was it not from the hope that it would afford satis 
faction to the best of parents. I have allotted to me for 
Commencement an English oration, upon the importance 
and necessity of public faith to the well-being of a community. The subject is noble and of the greatest consequence. It deserves a more able defender, and indeed 
requires it; for our public faith at present is in a sad condition. I am led unaware into political ground, and now I am there I must indulge myself.

Mr. Hancock was again elected governor this year, and 
out of 18,000 votes he had more than 13,000. This plainly 
shows that the people in general are displeased with some 
part of Mr. Bowdoin's conduct; but it is the caprice of an 
ungrateful populace, for which it must ever be impossible 
to account. Mr. Hancock is very much involved in debt, 
if common report be true. It is even confidently asserted 
that his present estate would not by any means do justice to his creditors. It is therefore concluded that he would 
favor tender acts, paper currencies, and all those measures 
which would give the sanction of the law to private fraud 
and villany. It was supposed that a Senate and an House 
of Representatives would be chosen, perfectly willing to 
abolish all contracts public and private, ready in short to 
redress the people's grievances, that is, to gratify their 
passions and justify their crimes. But these fears were 
not entirely well grounded. There are indeed several Senators and many representatives who would stick at nothing. 
A Willard, a Drury, a Whitney, and many others who 
have openly espoused the cause of treason and rebellion, 
are now among the legislators of the country. Intestinam aliquam quotidie perniciem reipublicae molientes. There is 
however in both branches of the legislature a majority of 
well-meaning men, who will support the dignity of the 
government, and who will not prostitute the honor of their 
country. A motion was made a few days since that a 
committee should be appointed to examine the merits of a 
paper currency, and to report upon the expediency of an 
emission at present. But there was a majority of more 
than fifty, even against the committing it. It has been 
resolved that the Court should move out of the town of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, and the committee have finally recommended Con 
cord as the most proper place to which it may be removed. 
The people in the country are very earnest in this point, 
and as usual without knowing why. The salaries of all 
civil officers, which are now too small, will infallibly be 
reduced still lower. Mr. Hancock, who has a peculiar talent of pleasing the multitude, has compounded this matter by offering to make a present to the public of 3Oo. 
But I consider this as a pernicious precedent, a palliative 
worse than it would have been, had the legislature cur 
tailed the salary. For if one man gives up 3Oo, another, 
fishing equally for popularity, may give more, and the chair 
of government may finally be offered to the lowest bidder. 
It is impossible for a free nation to subsist without parties, 
and unfortunately our parties are not yet formed. The democratical branch of our government is at present quite 
unrivalled, and we severely feel the want of sufficient strength in the other branches. The Senate indeed has 
several times within these eighteen months saved the Commonwealth from complete anarchy, and perhaps from 
destruction; but its hands are tied, and the people are too generally disposed to abolish the Senate as an useless 
body. I have indeed great hopes that the "Defence of the 
Constitutions" will produce an alteration in their sentiments. It will certainly have great weight. One printer 
in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> is employed in printing a new edition of this book, and another is retailing it twice a week, in a news 
paper, so that I hope it will be sufficiently spread through out the Commonwealth. As to the monarchical power, it 
appears to be entirely out of the question, and unless by a revolution it be established upon the ruin of the two others, 
it will never possess influence sufficient to hold the balance between them.

There was this year no choice of a lieutenant governor by the people. Mr. Cushing and General Lincoln were 
the primary candidates. Mr. Gorham and General Heath had likewise some hundreds of votes. The House sent up 
Mr. Gushing and Mr. Gorham to the Senate, because General Lincoln was a military character. The Senate 
were unanimous in favor of Mr. Gushing, who will probably 
drop at the next election. Mr. Adams has been much 
opposed to General Lincoln, and had sufficient influence to 
prevent his being chosen even as a councillor, because he 
is a member of the Society of Cincinnati. It is strange 
that no one dares attack this institution openly. It is 
daily acquiring strength, and will infallibly become a body 
dangerous, if not fatal to the Constitution. Immediately 
after the death of General Greene, it was asked by one of 
the State Societies that his eldest son, at the age of eighteen 
should take his seat as a member. I was perfectly astonished 
to see no notice taken of this measure by the public. By 
dropping the hereditary part of the constitution, they will 
after some time reduce themselves to a small number, and 
by admitting the sons of the most distinguished characters, 
they obtain their end, as completely as if it were professedly 
hereditary. But as they are not immediately dangerous, 
and there are so many other difficulties that engage the 
attention of the public, nothing is said, or done upon the 
subject, and they are suffered to take their own course. 
A free people always were and always will be ready to strain 
at a gnat and swallow a camel.
