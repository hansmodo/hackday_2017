DEAR DOCTOR, 
</p><p>
I wrote to you on the 4th instant, and sent you a paper of 
observations on your specimens of silk, drawn up by Mr. Patterson, who is noted here in that trade, with a specimen 
of Italian silk as a copy for our people to imitate. But they 
must not be discouraged if they should not come up to the 
lustre of it, that being the very finest, and from a particular 
district in Italy, none other being equal to it from any other 
district or any other country.

The European silk I understand is all yellow, and most 
of the India silk. What comes from China is white. In 
Ogilby's account of that country, I find that, in the province 
of Chekiang, "they prune their mulberry trees once a year, 
as we do our vines in Europe, and suffer them not to grow up 
to high trees, because through long experience they have 
learned, that the leaves of the smallest and youngest trees 
make the best silk, and know thereby how to distinguish the 
first spinning of the threads from the second, viz. the first is 
that which comes from the young leaves, that are gathered in 
March, with which they feed their silkworms ; and the second 
is of the old summer leaves. And it is only the change of 
food, as to the young and old leaves, which makes the difference in the silk. The prices of the first and second spinning 
differ among the Chineses. The best silk is that of March, 
the coarsest of June, yet both in one year." I have copied 
this passage to show, that in Chekiang they keep the mulberry trees low; but I suppose the reason to be, the greater 
facility of gathering the leaves. It appears too by this passage, that they raise two crops a year in that province, which 
may account for the great plenty of silk there. But perhaps 
this would not answer with us, since it is not practised in 
Italy, though it might be tried. Chekiang is from twentyseven to thirty-one degrees of north latitude. Duhalde has 
a good deal on the Chinese management of the silk business.

Dr. Pullein l is an acquaintance of mine. I will forward 
any letters you may send him. He lives in Ireland, but often 
comes to London.

As you did not write to Dr. Fothergill, I communicated to 
him what you wrote in favour of Mr. Parke, who is to wait on him to-morrow. I shall be glad to render the young man any 
service here.

We had a cold, backward spring here, and it is since the 
solstice that we have had what may be called a warm day. 
But the country now looks well with the prospect of great 
plenty. It is, however, the general opinion, that Britain will 
not for some years export much corn, great part of the arable 
land being now enclosed and turned to grass, to nourish the 
immense number of horses raised for exportation, there being 
a rage in France and other parts of Europe for English horses, 
that seems increasing every year.

I hope our friend Galloway will not decline the public service in the Assembly with his private business. Both may be 
too much for his health ; but the first alone will be little more 
than an amusement. And I do not see that he can be spared 
from that station, without great detriment to our affairs and to 
the general welfare of America. I am, with sincere esteem, 
&c. B. FRANKLIN.

P. S. The enclosed notes were given me by Mr. Small, a 
leading member of the Society of Arts, with a desire that I 
would send them over to some member of your Philosophical 
Society ; supposing the herbs may be of some use.
