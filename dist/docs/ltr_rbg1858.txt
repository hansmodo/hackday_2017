Your letter my beloved brother was most gratefully received, Ann and the Dear Girls have been very kind in 
writing frequently to allay my anxiety during the fearful period of your tribulation- yours too came safely. Mrs Mayo 
came to see me a few days ago- and says Col Gracie was much pleased with his intercourse with you (notwithstand- 
ing your difference in politics) I am surprised Major M has not answerd your letter- no mention was made on the subject, Horace seeing it advertized told him about it- & subsequently heard it had been removed, the Major's associates 
here are among the disaffected, (the Ingersols- Moncure Robinson, Wm B Reed &c) so I fear what ever sentiments 
he might have entertained in the beginning- they are now so far implicated on the wrong side that he will find it difficult 
to recede- poor Sara is victimized being the only loyal member of the household the subject therefore nearest all our 
hearts is never discussed in their household- .... unfortunately there are too many sympathizers in the wrong cause, in all our cities

I am glad to hear Dear Bernard is at home. God grant there may be no need for military efforts- he is a brave 
soldier- but I am a very coward for those I love- you have done wisely in not increasing your home family- young 
children would interfere greatly with your comfort & habits- nor would Ann find it contribute to her happiness- I love my 
little visitors but the cares & anxiety attendant on their rearing are only suited to young folks. I know My dear Ben 
that you cannot leave home, nor dare I wish it - duty well performed is the only source of happiness which the world 
cannot take from us. My health is good- if I live to see better times, the joy of embracing you, will be greater from know- 
ing that you can come without a sacrifice, in the mean time we will write to each other lovingly-

There is no appearance of light breaking upon the affairs of our country- the dismission of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gbm" rel="">Genl McClellan</a> has 
greatly shaken my hopes, and seems to have appalled those who looked upon him with due confidence in his worth & 
patriotism- Lizzie writes me that her Father strove with all might, to avert the evil- in vain,- she also says every word 
about the destitution of the noble army is true- their Genl would not move until they were clad- they marched by here, 
barefooted & ragged- so that her Mother even on Sunday all day gave needles and thread to mend their rags- where can 
the fault be, that such things can exist, when such quantities of clothing & shoes are furnished? we hear the enemies 
soldiers are well clad- and our brave fellows are suffering: 'There seems something is rotten in the state of Denmark." 
who can find it out?- I am glad your dear girls are so usefully employed, and trust your home will be cheerful & happy by 
their efforts & improvement- Edward Etting is rather better, his son Theodore, will soon leave for Newport, for the Naval Academy- they hear frequently from Charles, who writes 
very manly letters having chosen the Army as his profession, does not complain of the hardships of a soldiers life- Horace 
sends his best love to you, accept mine My beloved brother-

& May God for ever bless you, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rbg" rel="me">R GRATZ</a>
