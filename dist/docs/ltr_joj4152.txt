Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You will herewith receive copies of the acts of our two 
last sessions. A variety of official and other affairs, which, 
although in numerous instances of little importance, yet 
required to be despatched with punctuality, induced me, 
from time to time, to postpone replying to your obliging 
letter of the 19th November, and to thank you for the 
interesting pamphlets you was so kind as to send with it. 
</p><p>
We see many things, my dear sir, which might be altered 
for the better, and that, I believe, has been the case at all times. But at this period, there certainly are an uncommon number and series of events and circumstances, which 
assume an aspect unusually portentous. The seeds of 
trouble are sowing and germinating in our country, as well 
as in many others; they are cultivated with a zeal so 
singularly blind, as not, in many instances, to be easily 
accounted for. Infidelity has become a political engine, 
alarming both by the force and the extent of its operations. 
It is doubtless permitted to be used for wise ends, tho 
we do not clearly discern them ; when those ends shall be 
accomplished, it will be laid aside. 
</p><p>
Much ill use has been, and will yet be made of secret 
societies. I think with you that they should not be encouraged, and that the most virtuous and innocent of them 
would do well to concur in suspending them for the present. 
</p><p>
What precisely is to be understood of the death and 
resurrection of the witnesses, will probably be explained 
only by the event. I have an idea, that cither the Old and New Testaments, or the moral and revealed law are the twin 
witnesses : witnesses to the existence, attributes, promises, 
and denunciations of the Supreme Being. Atheism is now 
killing these witnesses. That all true and pious apostles 
or believers are everywhere or generally to be slain, seems 
hardly credible. Whatever or whoever the witnesses may 
be, it is certain that the slaughter is not yet perfected. I 
much doubt whether, in any view of the subject, the clergy 
of the church of Rome are of the number. 
</p><p>
The pope has lost his triple crown, and his spiritual 
dominion is rapidly declining. The Turk is now a party 
to the war ; whether any or what consequences will result 
from it to Mahomet, is yet to be seen. Wide is the field 
open for conjectures. 
</p><p>
That our country is to drink very deep of the cup of 
tribulation, I am not apprehensive ; but that we shall entirely escape, does not appear to me very probable. I 
suspect that the jacobins are still more numerous, more 
desperate, and more active in this country, than is generally 
supposed. It is true, they are less indecorous and less 
clamorous than they have been. How few of their leaders 
have abandoned their errors, their associations, their opposition to their own government, and their devotion to a 
foreign one ! Why, and by whom, were the Kentucky and 
Virginia resolutions contrived, and for what purposes ? I 
often think of Pandora's box : although it contained every 
kind of evil, yet it is said that hope was placed at the bottom. This is a singular fable, and it admits of many, and 
some of them very extensive applications. 
</p><p>
With very sincere esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
