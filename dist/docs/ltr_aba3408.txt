MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
This day eight months I sailed for Europe, since 
which many new and interesting scenes have presented themselves before me. I have seen many of 
the beauties, and some of the deformities, of this 
old world. I have been more than ever convinced, 
that there is no summit of virtue, and no depth of 
vice, which human nature is not capable of rising to, 
on the one hand, or sinking into, on the other. I 
have felt the force of an observation, which I have 
read, that daily example is the most subtile of poisons. I have found my taste reconciling itself to 
habits, customs, and fashions, which at first disgusted me. The first dance which I saw upon the stage 
</p><p>
shocked me ; the dresses and beauty of the performers were enchanting ; but, no sooner did the 
dance commence, than I felt my delicacy wounded, 
and I was ashamed to be seen to look at them. 
Girls, clothed in the thinnest silk and gauze, with 
their petticoats short, springing two feet from the 
floor, poising themselves in the air, with their feet 
flying, and as perfectly showing their garters and 
drawers as though no petticoat had been worn, was 
a sight altogether new to me. Their motions are 
as light as air, and as quick as lightning; they balance themselves to astonishment. No description 
can equal the reality. They are daily trained to it, 
from early infancy, at a royal academy, instituted 
for this purpose. You will very often see little 
creatures, not more than seven or eight years old, 
as undauntedly performing their parts as the eldest 
among them. Shall I speak a truth, and say that 
repeatedly seeing these dances has worn off that 
disgust, which I at first felt, and that I see them now 
with pleasure ? Yet, when I consider the tendency 
of these things, the passions they must excite, and 
the known character, even to a proverb, which is 
attached to an opera girl, my abhorrence is not 
lessened, and neither my reason nor judgment has 
accompanied my sensibility in acquiring any degree of callousness. The art of dancing is carried 
to the highest degree of perfection that it is capable 
of. At the opera, the house is neither so grand, nor 
of so beautiful architecture, as the French theatre, but 
it is more frequented by the beau monde, who had 
rather be amused than instructed. The scenery is 
more various and more hio;hlv decorated, the dresses 
more costly and rich. And O ! the music, vocal 
and instrumental, it has a soft, persuasive power, 
and a dying sound. Conceive a highly decorated 
building, filled with youth, beauty, grace, ease, clad 
in all the most pleasing and various ornaments of 
dress, which fancy can form ; these objects singing 
like cherubs to the best tuned instruments, most 
skilfully handled, the softest, tenderest strains ; every 
attitude corresponding with the music ; full of the 
god or goddess whom they celebrate ; the female 
voices accompanied by an equal number of iVdonises. 
Think you that this city can fail of becoming a Cythera, 
and this house the temple of Venus ? 
</p><p>
" When music softens, and when dancino- fires," 
</p><p>
it requires the immortal shield of the invincible Minerva, to screen youth from the arrows which assail them on every side. 
</p><p>
As soon as a girl sets her foot upon the floor of 
the opera, she is excommunicated by the Church, and 
denied burial in holy ground. She conceives nothing 
worse can happen to her ; all restraint is thrown off, 
and she delivers herself to the first who bids high 
enough for her. But let me turn from a picture, of 
which the outlines are but just sketched ; I would 
willingly veil the rest, as it can only tend to excite 
sentiments of horror.

13 March, 1785. 
</p><p>
You will see, by the former date, that my letter 
has lain by me some time. Mr. Pickman, of Salem, 
who is going to <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, has promised to take this 
with him, and will carry it himself, if no opportunity 
offers before, to America. We are all well ; some 
preparing for America, and others longing for the 
time of their departure thither. What a sad misfortune it is to have the body in one place, and the soul 
in another. Indeed, my dear sister, I hope to come 
home the spring after the present. My acquaintance 
here is not large, nor ever will be. Then, what are 
dinners, and visits of ceremony, compared with 
" the feast of reason, and the flow of soul " ? I 
have dined twice at the Marquis de la Fayette's, 
with a large company, some of whom I was acquainted with, and others that I never saw before ; 
and to-morrow are to dine here, Mr. Brantzen, 
the Ambassador Extraordinary from Holland ; the 
Chevalier de la Luzerne, late Minister in America ; 
Marquis de la Fayette and his lady ; Mr. W. T. 
Franklin, late Secretary to the American Commission ; Colonel Humphreys, our present Secretary : 
and Mr. Williams, a worthy, clever gentleman, 
who has been very friendly to us ; Mr, Jonathan 
Williams, a <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>ian, who very often comes to 
have a social talk about all our old friends and 
acquaintance in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ; the Chevalier Jones ; Mr. 
Bingham and lady ; a Mr. and Mrs. Rucker, and 
Mrs, Rucker's sister, lately from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, strangers to me ; but all strangers, from every part of 
America, visit the American Ministers, and then 
ire invited to dine with them. The Due de la 
Vauguyon was invited also ; but, not hearing from 
him, I suppose him not in Paris at present ; he was 
late Minister from this Court to Holland. Madame 
la Marquise de la Fayette is a very agreeable lady, 
and has two very pretty children ; the third, Virginia, 
I have never seen ; it is in the country ; the eldest 
daughter is seven years old, and George Washington about five. After dinner, Miss and Master are 
always introduced to the company ; both of them 
speak English, and behave very prettily. Madame 
de la Fayette has promised to bring me acquainted 
with her mother, the Duchess de Noailles, who is 
now at Versailles, waiting for the birth of a Prince, 
or Princess, which is daily expected ; and, as she is 
one of the ladies of honor to the Queen, her attend, 
ance is indispensable. 
</p><p>
I have scarcely room left to say, that I am, 
Very affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
A. A.
