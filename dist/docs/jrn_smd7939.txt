"To be, or not to be; that's the question." Whether tis nobler in the Confederacy to suffer the pangs of unappeasable hunger and never-ending 
trouble, or to take passage to a Yankee port, and there remaining, end them. Which is best? I am so near daft that I cannot pretend to say; I only know 
that I shudder at the thought of going to <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>, and that my heart fails me when I think of the probable consequence to mother if I allow a mere 
outward sign of patriotism to overbalance what should be my first consideration her health. For <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> is growing no better rapidly. To be hungry 
is there an everyday occurrence. For ten days, mother writes, they have lived off just hominy enough to keep their bodies and souls from parting, 
without being able to procure another article not even a potato. Mother is not in a condition to stand such privation ; day by day she grows weaker on her 
new regimen ; I am satisfied that two months more of danger, difficulties, perplexities, and starvation will lay her in her grave. The latter alone is enough to 
put a speedy end to her days. Lilly has been obliged to put her children to bed to make them forget they 
were supperless, and when she followed their example, could not sleep herself, for very hunger.

We have tried in vain to find another home in the Confederacy. After three days spent in searching <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a>, Gibbes wrote that it was impossible to find 
a vacant room for us, as the city was already crowded with refugees. A kind <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> must have destined that disappointment in order to save my life, 
if there is any reason for Colonel Steadman's fears. We next wrote to Mobile, Brandon, and even that 
horrid little Liberty, besides making inquiries of every one we met, while Charlie, too, was endeavoring to find a place, and everywhere received the 
same answer not a vacant room, and provisions hardly to be obtained at all. 
</p><p>
The question has now resolved itself to whether 
we shall see mother die for want of food in <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>, 
or, by sacrificing an outward show of patriotism (the 
inward sentiment cannot be changed), go with her to 
<a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>, as Brother begs in the few letters 
he contrives to smuggle through. It looks simple 
enough. Ought not mother's life to be our first consideration? Undoubtedly! But suppose we could 
preserve her life and our free sentiments at the same 
time? If we could only find a resting-place in the 
Confederacy ! This, though, is impossible. But to go 
to <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>; to cease singing "Dixie"; to be 
obliged to keep your sentiments to yourself for I 
would not wound Brother by any Ultra-Secession 
speech, and such could do me no good and only 
injure him if he is as friendly with the Federals 
as they say he is; to listen to the scurrilous abuse 
heaped on those fighting for our homes and liberties, 
among them my three brothers could I endure it? 
I fear not. Even if I did not go crazy, I would grow 
so restless, homesick, and miserable, that I would 
pray for even <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> again. Oh, I don t, don't want 
to go ! If mother would only go alone, and leave us 
with Lilly! But she is as anxious to obtain Dr. Stone's advice for me as we are to secure her a comfortable home; and I won't go anywhere without 
Miriam, so we must all go together. Yet there is no 
disguising the fact that such a move will place us 
in a very doubtful position to both friends and enemies. However, all our friends here warmly advocate the move, and Will Pinckney and Frank both 
promised to knock down any one who shrugged 
their shoulders and said anything about it. But 
what would the boys say? The fear of displeasing 
them is my chief distress. George writes in the 
greatest distress about my prolonged illness, and his alarm about my condition. "Of one thing I am sure," 
he writes, "and that is that she deserves to recover; 
for a better little sister never lived." God bless him! 
My eyes grew right moist over those few words. 
Loving words bring tears to them sooner than angry 
ones. Would he object to such a step when he knows 
that the very medicines necessary for my recovery 
are not to be procured in the whole country? Would 
he rather have mother dead and me a cripple, in the 
Confederacy, than both well, out of it? I feel that if 
we go we are wrong; but I am satisfied that it is 
worse to stay. It is a distressing dilemma to be 
placed in, as we are certain to be blamed whichever 
course we pursue. But I don't want to go to New 
Orleans !

Before I had time to lay down my pen this evening, General Gardiner and Major Wilson were announced ; and I had to perform a hasty toilette before 
being presentable. The first remark of the General was that my face recalled many pleasant recollections; that he had known my family very well, but 
that time was probably beyond my recollection ; and 
he went on talking about father and Lavinia, until I 
felt quite comfortable, with this utter stranger. . . . 
I would prefer his speaking of "our" recent success 
at Port Hudson to " my " ; for we each, man, woman, 
and child, feel that we share the glory of sinking the 
gunboats and sending Banks back to <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> 
without venturing on an attack; and it seemed odd to hear any one assume the responsibility of the whole affair and say "my success" so unconsciously. 
But this may be the privilege of generals. I am no judge, as this is the first Confederate general I have had the pleasure of seeing. Wish it had been old <a href='/results.php?tla=tjj' rel=''>Stonewall</a>! I grow enthusiastic every time I think of the dear old fellow! 
</p><p>
I am indebted to General Gardiner for a great piece of kindness, though. I was telling him of how many enemies he had made among the ladies by his 
strict regulations that now rendered it almost impossible for the gentlemen to obtain permission to call on them, when he told me if I would signify to 
my friends to mention when they applied that their visit was to be here, and not elsewhere, that he would answer for their having a pass whenever they 
called for one. Merci du compliment; mais c est trap tard, Monsieur I
