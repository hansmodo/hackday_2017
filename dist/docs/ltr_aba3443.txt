MY DEAR MRS. SMITH, 
</p><p>
Although the scenes in which I have been en^a^ed 
for six weeks past, have been very- different from 
those which you describe, I have been amused and 
entertained by your account. Though I cannot say 
that I am charmed with your hero's personal accomplishments, as you describe them, yet you find 
</p><p>
" A man of wealth is dubbed a man of worth ; 
Venus can give him fcrm, and Anstis birth." 
</p><p>
I think our ladies ought to be cautious of foreigners. I am almost led to suspect a spy in every 
strange character. It is much too easy a matter for 
a man, if he has property, to get introduced into 
company in this country of the best kind, and that 
without recommendations. The entertainment you 
describe was really very curious. 
</p><p>
" Men overloaded with a large estate, 
May spill their treasure in a queer conceit ; " 
</p><p>
and I am sure this was of that kind. 
</p><p>
You may mix in these scenes, and sometimes 
join in the society ; but neither your habits, your 
inclination, nor your natural disposition are formed 
for them. By nature you have a grave and thoughtful cast of temper, by habit you have been trained 
to more rational and durable pleasures, and by inclination you delight more in them. The frivolity 
of the present day has been much increased by our 
foreign connexions. I pray Heaven to preserve us 
from that dissoluteness of manners, which is the bane 
of society, and the destroyer of domestic happiness. 
I think, with the poet, 
</p><p>
" If individual good engage our hope, 
Domestic virtues give the largest scope ; 
If plans of public eminence we trace, 
Domestic virtues are its surest base." 
You complain that there is, in the rising generation, a want of principle. This is a melancholy 
truth. I am no friend of bigotry ; yet I think the 
freedom of inquiry, and the general toleration of religious sentiments, have been, like all other good 
things, perverted, and, under that shelter, deism, and 
even atheism, have found refuge. Let us, for one 
moment, reflect as rational creatures, upon our " being, end, and aim," and we shall feel our dependence, 
we shall be convinced of our frailty, and satisfied that 
we must look beyond this transitory scene for a happiness large as our wishes, and boundless as our desires. True, genuine religion is calm in its inquiries, 
deliberate in its resolves, and steady in its conduct : 
is open to light and conviction, and labors for improvement. It studies to promote love and union 
in civil and in religious society. It approves virtue, 
and the truths which promote it, and, as the Scripture 
expresses it, " is peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated." It is the anchor of our hope, the ornament 
of youth, ' he comfort of age ; our support in affliction 
and adversity, and the solace of that solemn hour, 
which we must all experience. Train up, my dear 
daughter, your children, to a sober and serious sense 
of the duty which they owe to the Supreme Being. 
Impress their infant minds with a respect for the 
Sabbath. This is too much neglected by the rising 
generation. Accustom them to a constant attendance upon public worship, and enforce it by your 
own example and precept, as often as you can with 
any convenience attend. It is a duty, for which we 
are accountable to the Supreme Being. 
My pen has again taken a serious turn. I shall 
not apologize for it. Your own letter led to these 
reflections ; and I am sure they flow from a heart 
anxiously solicitous for the happiness of you and 
yours. That they may make a due impression, is 
the ardent and affectionate wish of 
</p><p>
Your mother, 
</p><p>
A. Adams.
