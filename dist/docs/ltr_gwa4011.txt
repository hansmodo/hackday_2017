My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since writing to you, by Mr. Bayard, about the first of 
November, I have been favoured with your letters of the 
13th September and 2d of October. 
As the sentiments contained in the first of these, respecting the communications of <a href='/results.php?tla=jam' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Monroe</a> to the National 
Convention of France, were also transmitted in a private 
letter from you to the secretary of state, and replied to by 
him (both of which I have seen), I shall dwell no longer on 
that subject, than just to observe, 1st, that considering the 
place in which they were delivered, and the neutral policy 
this country had resolved to pursue, it was a measure that 
does not appear to have been well devised by our minister : 
2dly, aware of this himself, and that his conduct would be 
criticised, he has assigned reasons for its adoption ; a summary of which is, that the navy officers and privateersmen of France, who had resorted to our ports and had been 
laid under such restrictions as neutral policy required from 
us, although disagreeable to them, had represented this 
country (and not without effect) as unfriendly to the French 
revolution; to do away which he found himself necessitated 
to counteract them, by strong assurances of the good dispositions of the people of these United States towards that 
nation : and 3dly, although I think with you that in order 
to accomplish this he has stepped beyond the true line, yet, 
under the then existing circumstances, the expression of 
such reciprocal good will was susceptible of two views, one 
of which, even in the pending state of the negotiation (by 
alarming as well as offending the British ministry), might 
have no unfavourable operation in bringing matters to a 
happy and speedy result, than which nothing is more desirable, or can be more ardently wished for by the friends of 
peace and good order in this country. 
</p><p>
As the secretary of state has written to you several 
times since the receipt of your statement of the negotiation 
on the 13th of September, I shall add nothing to the observations which are contained in his letters on the subject 
thereof. 
</p><p>
The business of the session, hitherto, has been tranquil ; 
and I perceive nothing at this time to make it otherwise, 
unless the result of the negotiation (which is anxiously expected by all) should produce divisions. As yet, no details 
have been handed to Congress on this subject ; indeed, no 
communication of that business has been made to anybody, 
except those immediately about me in the executive departments. 
</p><p>
The Virginia escheats of British property do not, as I 
am informed, stand upon the ground as related to you ; but 
as I am not accurately enough read in the law respecting 
these escheats to be precise in my recital of it, I will request the secretary of state to give you the principles 
thereof. 
</p><p>
As I expected, and as you have been informed the result 
would probably be, so it has happened, that the western 
insurrection has terminated highly honourable for this country ; which, by the energy of its laws, and the good dispositions of its citizens, has brought the rioters to a perfect sense of their duty, without shedding a drop of blood. 
In the eyes of foreigners among us, this affair stands in a 
high point of respectability. With great truth, I remain, 
</p><p>
Dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate, 
</p><p>
