DEAR SIR, I wrote you a few lines by the last post from this 
place, just to apprise you of my movement to it. I have since 
seen the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> and the Philad a papers, containing, the 
latter, the certificate of Jay & King, and the publications 
relating to the subject of it; the former, the proceedings at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a>, dictated, no doubt, by the cabal at Philad'. It is 
painful to observ.the success of the management for putting 
Wythe at the head of them. I understand, however, that a 
considerable revolution has taken place in his political sentiments, under the influence of some disgusts he has received 
from the State Legislature. By what has appeared, I discover 
that a determination has been formed to drag before the public 
the indiscretions of Genet, and turn them and the popularity 
of the President to the purposes driven at. Some impression 
will be made here, of course. A plan is evidently laid in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> to render it extensive. If an early and well-digested 
effort for calling out the real sense of the people be not made, 
there is room to apprehend they may, in many places, be misled. 
</p><p>
This has employed the conversation of and myself. 
</p><p>
We shall endeavor at some means of repelling the danger, particularly by setting on foot expressions of the public mind in 
important counties, and under the auspices of respectable 
names. I have written, with this view, to Caroline, and have 
suggested a proper train of ideas, and a wish that Mr. P. would 
patronize the measure. Such an example would have great 
effect. Even if it should not be followed, it would be considered as an authentic specimen of the Country temper, and 
would put other places on their guard against the snares that 
may be laid for them. The want of opportunities, and our 
ignorance of trustworthy characters, will circumscribe our 
efforts in this way to a very narrow compass. The rains for 
several days have, delayed my trip to the gentleman named in 
my last. Unless to-morrow should be a favorable day, I shall 
be obliged to decline it altogether. In two or three days I 
shall be in a situation to receive and answer your, as 
usual. That by Mr. D. R. has not reached me.
