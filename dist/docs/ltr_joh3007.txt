SIR, 
</p><p>
Since my last, I have had the honor of receiving your letters of the 24th and 30th of January, 9th, 14th, 18th, 21st, and 26th of February, which were 
communicated to Congress. On the settlements and adjustments of accounts, the Congress have not yet come to any determination ; nor have they yet had 
time to contrive expedients for remedying the inconveniences mentioned in that of the 9th, which is referred to, and will be taken up, in a Committee of the Whole. 
</p><p>
The Congress highly approve your care and attention in stopping Lord Drummond's letter, and entirely concur with you in sentiment with regard to 
his Lordship's officious and unwarrantable zeal. 
</p><p>
The situation of the Middle and Southern Colonies hath engaged the attention of Congress. These are divided into two departments ; the Middle, comprehending <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland, under the command of a Major-General and two Brigadier-Generals; the Southern, 
comprehending Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia, under the command of a Major-General and four Brigadier-Generals. As there is reason to 
think that the force of our enemies will be directed against the Colonies in the Southern Department, Major-General Lee is appointed to that command. 
The Brigadier-Generals are, John Armstrong, William Thompson, Andrew Lewis, James Moore, Esq., Lord Stirling, and Robert Howe, Esq. 
</p><p>
Of these gentlemen, General Armstrong is directed 
to repair to South Carolina; General Lewis and General Howe to Virginia ; General Moore to North Carolina; and General Thompson and Lord Stirling to 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. And, that our affairs in Canada may be 
under the direction of an able officer, and <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>'s health not permitting him to go thither, 
or, if he could, as his presence is so necessary in 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, the Congress have promoted Brigadier-General Thomas to the rank of a Major-General, and 
directed him to repair to Canada, and take the command of the Continental forces in that quarter. I 
have accordingly inclosed him his commission, and 
am to desire you will give him orders to repair, with 
all expedition, to his post. To enable him to exe 
cute the purposes Congress have in view in Canada, they have ordered twelve battering cannon to be sent from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and have forwarded ten tons of powder. 
</p><p>
Of this article, we have lately received several sup 
plies, and have, some time ago, ordered five tons and 
a half to be sent to you; which, if you have not 
already received, will, I hope, soon reach you. The 
Congress have also ordered ten tons more of powder 
to be sent to you, which will set out to-morrow or 
next day. Besides this, in the beginning of last 
month they ordered ten tons of saltpetre to be sent 
to Mr. Wisncr's powder-mill, in the Colony of New 
York; and, on the 12th of the same month, ten tons 
to Mr. Livingston's mill, in the same Colony; and 
ten tons to the Council of Massachusetts, with a desire to have it manufactured into gunpowder with all 
possible expedition, and sent to you for the use of 
the army under your command. Besides this, I have 
the pleasure to inform you, that the powder-mills in 
this Colony are employed, and more mills are building , which will be employed ; so that I have strong 
hopes we shall soon have a plentiful supply of that 
necessary article. 
</p><p>
With regard to arms, I am afraid W T C shall, for a 
time, be under some difficulty. The importation is 
now more precarious and dangerous. To remedy this, 
a Committee is appointed to contract for the making 
arms ; and, as there is a great number of gunsmiths 
in this and the neighbouring Colonies, I flatter my 
self we shall soon be able to provide ourselves without 
risk or danger. But W T C must, like other States engaged in the like glorious struggle, contend with difficulties. By perseverance, and the blessing of 
God, I trust, if we continue to deserve freedom, we shall be enabled to overcome them. To that Being, in whose hands is the fate of nations, I recommend 
you and the army under your command. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with every sentiment of 
esteem, 
</p><p>
Sir, your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
P. S. The inclosed letter I request the favor you 
will please order to be delivered to Mr. Gushing.
