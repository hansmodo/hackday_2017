Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
I now do both duties, Commander-in-Chief and Secretary of War. The truth is, the offices both united, are 
easier of execution than either separate; because the 
Statutes do not clearly define the spheres of each, and a 
natural conflict or suspicion arises. United in one person 
settles all disputes. In the present attitude of things, it 
would be a good thing to dispense with a Secretary of 
War, and unite Army and Navy in one representative 
in the Cabinet, and let the Internal Eevenue go into the 
Cabinet. . . . 
</p><p>
Yours,
