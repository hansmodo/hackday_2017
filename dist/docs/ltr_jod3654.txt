MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I WENT last night to the ball, where the company suffered more by the cold, which was excessive, than I ever 
knew any company suffer in my life. The dancers 
only were comfortable. I came home and went into 
a warm bed and had a fine perspiration, occasioned, 
I believe, by my drinking three glasses of Madeira 
wine at supper, and. two more after I came home, 
which has relieved me from all cold and I feel very 
well this morning. The company, owing to the 
weather, was not large. 
</p><p>
I am very anxious to hear from you, having no letter since the 10th. Your sickness last summer, fall, 
and winter, has been to me the severest trial I ever 
endured. Not that I am at this moment without 
other trials enough for one man. I may adopt the 
words of a celebrated statesman, whom, however, I 
should not wish to resemble in many things : " And 
now, good judge," says he, " let me ask you whether 
you believe that my situation in the world is perfectly as I could wish it ; whether you imagine that I 
meet with no shock from my superiors, no perverseness from my equals, no impertinence from my inferiors ? If you fancy me in such a state of bliss 
you are wide from the mark." 
</p><p>
I have planned out so much work for myself that 
I shall not be able to go eastward till some time after 
the rising of Congress. But every day will seem 
long. I am, my dearest friend, 
</p><p>
Yours forever, 
</p><p>
