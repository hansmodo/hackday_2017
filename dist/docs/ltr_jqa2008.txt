DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I am now much more at my disposal, with respect to my 
time, than I was at Haverhill, and can devote more of it 
to writing; though, it is said, this quarter, that is, the last of questions in Logic and in Locke and several in Geography were given to me." 
He was also asked to turn two English sentences into Latin, and was soon after told by the President that he was admitted and might live in the college the 
latter an unexpected advantage. His roommate was Henry Ware, who had 
graduated the previous year and was described as "one of the best moral and literary characters in his class." 
</p><p>
Adams remarked upon two matters in the college which could be altered for the better. "There is not sufficient communication between the classes. They 
appear to form four distinct orders of beings, and seldom associate together. . . . 
Another is, that the tutors are so very young. They are often chosen among bachelors that have not been out of college more than two years, so that their 
acquirements are not such as an instructor at this university ought to be possessed of. Another disadvantage of their being chosen so young is that they were the 
fellow scholars of those they are placed over, and consequently do not command so much respect as they seem to demand. However, take it all in all, I am strongly 
confirmed in your opinion, that this university is upon a much better plan than 
any I have seen in Europe."

"I was obliged in the course of six months to go through the studies which are 
performed here in two years and nine months. So different had my studies been 
from those at this place, that I had not before last October looked into a book that 
I was examined in, except Horace. Had I arrived here three months earlier, it 
would have been easier to enter into the class which graduates next Commencement, than it has been to enter the one I am in. This would have advanced me 
one year, but there are a number of public exercises here that I should not have 
performed and which I think may be advantageous ; such is speaking in the Chapel, 
before all the classes, which I shall have to do in my turn four or five times before 
we leave college. Such also are the forensic disputations, one of which we are 
to have to-morrow. A question is given out by the tutor in metaphysics, for the 
whole class to dispute upon. They alternately affirm or deny the question, and 
write, each, two or three pages for or against, which is read in the Chapel before the 
tutor, who finally gives his opinion concerning the question. We have two or 
three questions every quarter. That for to-morrow is, whether the immortality 
of the human soul is probable from natural reason? It comes in course for me to of the Junior Sophister year, is more important and busy 
than any other in the four years. Mr. Williams lectures 
on natural philosophy render it so. His course consists of 
twenty-four lectures, thirteen of which we have already 
had. I have hitherto taken minutes while he was speaking, 
and written off after I came out as much as I could recollect of them. Some of my class have told me they were 
not worth the time and pains I have spent upon them ; 
but I think they are, as they may serve to fix firmer in my 
mind the principles of an important branch of science, 
which I never before have studied. In my last letter to 
you I requested Desagulier's translation of's Gravesande's 
in two volumes octavo. There is 4to edition, but the other 
is that which is studied here. They are very scarce in this 
country, as they can neither be bought, nor borrowed out 
of college. We begin to recite in them tomorrow, but I 
shall endeavor to borrow them of some classmate for the 
two weeks we shall recite in them this quarter, and I hope 
to receive one before I shall have occasion for it again. 
This is the last quarter in which we recite in the languages. 
The next year we shall be confined to mathematics, natural 
philosophy and metaphysics. We shall finish Locke on 
the Understanding before the end of this year, and begin 
on Reid on the Mind. Our progress here is very slow, but 
we have so many things to attend to at once, that it can 
not well be otherwise.

I received a few days since your favor of March 19th, and at the same time, from my sister, Colonel Humphreys poem, which I think superior to the former. Among its 
beauties is a very happy imitation of a famous passage in Virgil, Jn. 6. 847, etc. It is in the 3&lt;Dth page : 
</p><p>
Let other climes of other produce boast, etc.

I think it is, as Boileau says of himself, "meme, en imitant, toujours original." America appears to hasten towards 
perfection in the fine arts, and any country would boast of 
a Belknap as an historian, a Dwight as a poet, and a West 
as a painter. There are in this University, one or two 
students, (now Senior Sophisters,) who promise fair to 
become very good poets. One of them, by the name of 
Fowle, was appointed a few days since to deliver a vale dictory poem on the 2ist of June, and it is said, has an 
other assigned him as a part at Commencement. There is 
among the governors of the college one, who for genius and 
learning, would make a figure in any part of Europe. I 
mean the Librarian, Mr. Winthrop. He has lately dis 
covered a method of trajecting an angle, which has so long 
been attempted in vain. Mr. Sewall :&gt; too, the former 
Hebrew Professor, is now producing his talents. He was 
obliged to resign, because it was said he was addicted to 
drinking. He most sacredly declared, at the time, that 
the accusation was false. It has been said as an argument 
to prove he was subject to the vice that his mental faculties were impaired. To show that this was not the fact, he has undertaken to translate Young's Night Thoughts into 
Latin verse. The first night is to be published soon. The 
work may be considered as a curiosity, and I shall send one 
as soon as they are printed.

June I4th. I have been so busy, since the date of the 
former part of this letter, that I have not been able to 
finish it. I have taken] in writing extracts of all I remember of the lectures upon natural philosophy. The course 
finished last Saturday, and I have now the disposal of my 
time, much more than I had before. The performances at 
Commencement are distributed, and are more numerous 
than they ever have been before. It is a doubt at present 
whether this is only a mark of favor to the class that is 
about to graduate, because it is said to be one of the best 
classes taken collectively, for genius, and learning, that has 
ever gone through College ; or whether it is the intention 
of the government for the future to increase the number 
of good parts, as they are called. Hitherto about two 
thirds of each class have had syllogistic disputes to perform 
at Commencement, and as they are never attended to, they 
are held in detestation by the scholars, and everyone thinks 
it a reflection upon his character as a genius and a student 
to have a syllogistic ; this opinion is the firmer, because 
the best scholars almost always have other parts. There 
are many disadvantages derived from these syllogisms, and 
I know only of one benefit, which is this. Many scholars 
would go through college without studying at all, but would 
idle away all their time, who merely from the horrors of 
syllogisms begin to study, acquire a fondness for it, and 
make a very pretty figure in college ; and it is not uncommon to see young fellows, the most idle in a class the two 
first years, have the reputation of great students, and good 
scholars the two latter. 
</p><p>
The next Commencement there will be delivered two 
English poems, two English orations, two Latin orations, a 
Greek dialogue, three forensic disputes, and an English 
dialogue between four. Thompson, a young gentleman 
from Newbury, has one of the English orations. He is 
generally supposed to be the most distinguished character in 
College. It is said by his classmates that he will outshine 
Harry Otis, who will deliver at the same time an oration 
upon taking his second degree; but it is now a doubt 
whether Thompson will appear, as he is very unwell. He 
has injured his health by hard study, and it is feared he has 
a slow fever.

The bridge at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charlestown</a> is very nearly completed. 
Next Saturday being the iyth of June, there is to be a long 
procession over the bridge, and an entertainment for six 
hundred persons provided on Bunkers Hill. I know of no 
news, as I am here quite retired. It is now eight weeks 
since this quarter began. Near as we are to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, I 
have been there only once in that time. A person who 
wishes to make any figure as a scholar at this University, 
must not spend much time either in visiting or in being visited. 
</p><p>
I have one more request to add to those I have already 
made. It is for Blair's Lectures in octavo, so that they 
may be in the same form with the sermons, and because an 
octavo is much more convenient than a quarto. Your dutiful son.
