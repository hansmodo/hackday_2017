Sunnyvale Calif. <br> Oct 21st , <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1918">1918</a> Monday <br><br> My Dear Horace, <br> We were much disappointed at not receiving our usual weekly letter but will write 
anyway for I know you want to hear. This morning the fog is very thick almost 
like rain but the air still comfortably warm and we had no frost as yet. The tomato 
mean are hauling immense loads by here. Carlyle gets $15 a ton and perhaps more 
and he says they will get $25 another year. Everything is still on the rise. I 
sold eggs for $.70 (unintelligible) Sunday and 5lbs of figs for $.30. Friday 18th 
we went into Palo Alto with most of my dried fruit. We rec’d splendid prices and 
were able to put in a pretty full supply for the winter out of my summer work. 
Among the things we had to sell were 8lbs of walnuts for which we were paid 35cts 
a lb if the three trees had held (unintelligible) all that promised before the 
last frost we would be able to sit down all the time and watch them grow. There 
was (unintelligible) (unintelligible) one of the trees you got of your friend 
in Palo Alto. After we had done out shopping we drove down the street where we 
could get a view of the encampment and then near Runnymede where the cottages 
are still going up in all directions. The drive into there was full of interesting 
sights. The fall rains give the whole country a look of prosperity and agricultural 
beauty (unintelligible phrase) while we know that on the other side of the mountains 
people are shivering in the cold. We went to your old place for lunch. We were 
so fortunate. While [unintelligible] your friend Oscar came in. He seemed a little 
excited and said he had just returned from S.J. where he had been called to report 
at the E. Board. He had enlisted and was drafted. He goes as a truck driver as 
he is under weight and size for other service. Clifford is also under training 
at the encampment. Oscar said he would find you if possible. We were so glad that 
you were able to endure that long weary journey and sleeping in the woods. We 
are hoping to be able to send you a little reminder of home on Xmas but you must 
send a R. [unintelligible initial] label. Mrs frost will send some more pictures 
of the ranch. Hoping with all my heart you are well and able to do your share 
which I know you will. <br><br> I am as ever your loving mother Sarah King
