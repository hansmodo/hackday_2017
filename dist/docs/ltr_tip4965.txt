... The enemy having entirely quitted Jersey, and the 
General suspecting they might go up the North River, the 
army moved up from Middle Brook, last Thursday, to this 
place, to be nearer to <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker'>General Sullivan</a>, with his 
division, is gone about twenty miles farther on, to a place 
called Pomptou. What led the General the more to apprehend a movement up the North River was, that the enemy 
from Canada were about to attack <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. We shall re 
main here till Howe makes some movement. If he goes up 
the river, we shall follow him. If he goes to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> 
(of which I think there is little danger) , we shall go thither. 
But, if he stands off with his fleet to the open sea, we shall 
not know where he is going, and of course be in a great 
quandary which way to steer. Two sailors, by one of whom 
I send this, escaped from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> the day before yesterday. They say the talk there was, among some, that Howe 
was going to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and, among others, that he was going 
to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. We are greatly at a loss to determine 
what his intentions are ; and, since he was disappointed in 
his plan of going to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> by land, we have some 
times suspected that Howe himself was at a loss which way 
to go. But, for my own part, if the enemy make a real 
attack on <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, I shall wonder if Howe does not 
go up the North River. . . .

P. S. I am so crowded with business, and as yet with 
out an assistant, my friends must excuse me if I do not 
write to them. The General, a week ago, desired me to 
get a deputy ; which I shall do as soon as I can light on a 
good one. . . .
