SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency, I dare say, has been informed of 
the evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=fort mifflin' rel='city'>Fort Mifflin</a>, and the gallant defence there made by Major Thayer. The evacuation 
of that fort, the removal of our navy, the movements 
of the British fleet, and our own situation at present, 
have put it wholly out of my power to answer those 
important purposes for which your Excellency was pleased to order me to this command. 
</p><p>
Our fleet here are now moving as fast as possible 
to Timber Creek. The river is so open to the enemy's shipping, that topsail and other vessels are now 
passing between Mud Island and Province Island to 
the Schuylkill, unmolested. Fort Mercer is tolerably secure against a storm only. A bomb-proof magazine is nearly finished; no other security in the 
fort against shells. A strong breastwork partly finished on the bank, takes up a considerable part of 
the floor of the fort; and the magazine takes up so 
much, that the remainder of the floor is insufficient 
to spring tents on for more than one third of the garrison. 
</p><p>
The proposal for building a bomb-proof under the 
bank is now at an end, since <a href='/results.php?city=fort mifflin' rel='city'>Fort Mifflin</a> is lost. 
The communication to Red Bank, by water, is nearly 
intercepted; and, should a party of the enemy in 
vest this fort by land, our whole supply would be 
cut off; and, should they erect bomb-batteries on the 
land side, they would be able to throw shells to 
us on all sides; from all of which I conclude, that 
an army investing us, sufficient to keep the field, 
will reduce the garrison, and make the survivors 
prisoners, as we could have no retreat. 
</p><p>
Thus, having given your Excellency what appears 
to me, with the unanimous voice of all the Field Officers of the garrison, a true state of our circum 
stances, and observations thereon, I wait your Excellency's particular commands and directions, for an 
invariable rule for me to pursue ; for which purpose 
Major Ward will wait on your Excellency, to whom 
I refer for a more particular account of matters here. 
</p><p>
With every sentiment of respect and esteem, I am, 
Your Excellency's humble servant, 
</p><p>
