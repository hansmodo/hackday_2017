My Dear Brother : I have received your letter. The 
difference between the Kansas case and this is that in 
Kansas the efforts came from the slavery party to 
restrain the free emigration, and to stuff the vote, so 
as to nullify the numbers of free voters. Here the 
ballot-box stuffing was partly imaginary, the famous box 
being a humbug, used at the primary elections to secure 
the nominations, and never used at the public polls. 
One was positively illegal, the other was simply irregular, and the Legislature of the State had already 
decided that the judges of election should be appointed 
by five well-known gentlemen of this city, a remedy 
ample and conclusive for future elections, which was an 
admission on the part of the State that the former 
judges of election were not trustworthy. Again, in 
Kansas it was doubtful who was the legal governor. 
Here there is no question that Johnson was duly and 
fairly elected, for if any illegal votes were cast, they 
were against him. The city of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san francisco" rel="city">San Francisco</a>, where 
all these alleged frauds were committed, voted against 
Johnson. If murder had not been punished heretofore, 
it was not the fault of the judges, but of the juries, the 
merchants, and those who are of the Vigilance Committee, having avoided jury duty as much as possible. 
I remember when Cora's jury was empanelled, there was 
a universal answer that it was a good jury, and the judge 
charged strongly for murder ; but the jury did not agree, 
and those who voted for Cora's acquittal were of the 
Vigilance Committee. Same of Hothington's trial.

Your affectionate brother,
