TO MRS. MADISON FROM <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=smy" rel="me">SALLY D YRUJO</a> (SALLY MCKEAN).

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, June 20, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1812">1812</a>. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=dol" rel="friend">MRS. MADISON</a>, I arrived here about ten days ago, and had a strong 
desire to write you the moment of my arrival, but the state of affairs suggested to 
me this idea, that it was most prudent to suspend it until things took a decisive turn, 
lest some exalted patriot might suspect our innocent correspondence. This motive 
having at present ceased, I do not lose a moment to write you ; it would delight me 
to spend a day with you, and be able to press you to my heart, but I am obliged to 
set out for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> to-morrow, or next day, at furthest I will not leave America, 
however, without seeing you. On account of the Marquis's health becoming affected 
by the climate of Brazil, he asked to be recalled, and we were on the point of embarking in a ship going directly to Spain, 
when, happily for me, a fine ship from this port came along, and I prevailed on the 
Marquis to return by way of my own dear native country, on condition of departing 
for Cadiz in October. But I will not go before next spring, if I can possibly help it, for am tired of so many long voyages. 
</p><p>
Your son Payne has been twice to see me, but unfortunately I was out both times ; 
the Marquis saw him, and says he is a fine young man, grown so tall and handsome. 
I shall make an effort to find him to-day, and intend to ask him if he remembers that 
when a little fellow he pulled off General Van Courtland's wig at the very moment 
he was making me a flourishing compliment. What has become of the old beau? 
The ladies and gentlemen of this place have been very polite to me, every one has 
been to see us, and I have dined at home but once. 
</p><p>
I have been highly amused by a piece of poetry, relative to a scene they say took 
place in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a> last winter, in which the famous Count de Crillon cut a figure, 
as well as some ladies, and I am told the winter was a most dashing one in your 
city. I am sorry the Count P. left just before our arrival, so many fine things 
are said in his praise. I find Madame Bonaparte a good deal changed. We had 
heard in Rio Janeiro that she bore the title of "Duchess," and had a salary of 
fifty thousand pounds. I verily think when I see you and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="friend met">Anna</a> once more, there is 
so much to tell you of what I have seen and heard abroad as would keep me talking 
for three days without stopping, and I am morally certain I should make you laugh, 
and your good husband too, for I am just as giddy and full of spirits as ever. Indeed, I am for the French principle, never 
to let anything trouble me much unless it is absolutely necessary. 
</p><p>
Your sister Lucy is again married, I hear, but am sorry she has gone so far off ; 
rumor says she has been a great belle, and is as lively and amiable as ever. Tell me 
if you received a letter from me dated Rio Janeiro, by Mr. C. of this place, as I never 
received an answer. In answer to the thousand questions I have asked about you, 
they say that you never looked so well in your life, and that you give and have given 
universal satisfaction to all friends and visitors, which is, indeed, a very difficult 
matter, that of pleasing everybody. You, however, were always so good, and possessed such an amiable temper, as to make 
every one your friend. I have heard much in your praise from the American gentle 
men who have been in Brazil, when, you may be sure, I asked hundreds of questions about you all. My two dear children 
(only two) are well, and grown so much you would not know them. They speak English, Spanish, and Portuguese fluently, and 
are learning French. I find I cannot now say a word in that language I do not want 
them to understand. Give my love (yes love !) to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="friend met">Mr. Madison</a>, and ask him if he 
has entirely forgotten me, and the dear old times ? And when you write to Mr. Jefferson's daughter, Mrs. Randolph, pray remember me particularly to her. She is a 
sweet woman, and I have a great regard for her. The Marquis desires his best 
compliments to yourself and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="friend met">Mr. Madison</a>. And believe me, my dear Mrs. Madison, your old and affectionate friend, 
</p><p>
