</p><p>
I have to thank you for your favor of September 10, 
which Mr. Deas delivered to me on my arrival here. The 
letter of Mr. Randolph, dated July 21, had indeed been to 
me a subject of equal pain and surprise. Combined with 
the numerous accounts of irregular popular proceedings in 
different parts of the United States, and with a prejudice 
discoverable in the minds of almost all the Americans I met 
who had recently come from the United States, it induced 
an unpleasant anticipation of the consequences that awaited 
the United States from the designs of some, and the un 
guarded hastiness of others, among their citizens. 
</p><p>
It gives me pleasure to observe from your letter, that the 
proceedings of the popular meetings on the subject of the treaty are in every respect less important, than from many 
circumstances I had been apprehensive. That the hasty rashness of the meetings was the result of a concerted plan, 
and that every artifice had been employed to take the people by surprise, and to use them as instruments for a purpose, 
the success of which would eventually prove their irreparable misfortune, I can readily believe, as I had long suspected 
that such would be the case before it happened ; but that the Secretary of State should be accessary to such a manoeuvre is what I could not have believed from any opinion 
less respectable than yours, and of which I would still fain hope he was innocent. 
</p><p>
The occasion of his resignation you have mentioned, however, as originating in a different source. But notwithstanding the force of your expression, that he had forfeited 
the confidence of the President, the story which is not much of a secret here must be loaded with great exaggerations, if not with absolute falsehood. 
</p><p>
The intelligence of the pacifications with the Indian tribes 
and of the general prosperity enjoyed throughout the United 
States, while it accounts in some measure for the violence 
and the arts used to defeat the system to which the peace 
and prosperity can alone be attributed, is, I would hope, a 
sure token that all the endeavors to delude the people into a 
sacrifice of their own welfare will prove as unsuccessful as 
they have hitherto been. 
</p><p>
The system of policy pursued by the President since the 
commencement of the present European war has been en 
countered by so many difficulties and embarrassments, 
which the wisdom of his government has removed and over 
come, that I feel encouraged in the hope that it will be 
successfully pursued to the end. The war in all probability 
approaches towards its termination. Another campaign is barely possible. More than one I cannot under the present 
state of affairs anticipate, and the scale of probability as it appears to me inclines towards a general peace, or at 
least a cessation of hostilities before the close of the year ensuing. . . . 
</p><p>
The situation of this country one would imagine not much 
less critical than that of France and of the United Provinces. 
The scarcity of grain and flour is so considerable that it has 
been among the first subjects of deliberation to the Parliament now assembled, to take measures for preventing an 
absolute famine. Riots have recently taken place in different parts of the Kingdom owing to the price of provisions, of bread especially, and those who have been so anxiously 
desirous of trying the experiment of a famine abroad may 
perhaps witness its effects without going from home. 
</p><p>
This circumstance has naturally given a vigor to the discontented party, and has much increased the fermentation 
that was before operating in silence among the lower ranks 
of people particularly in the capital. Numerous popular 
meetings have been held, and their orators have declaimed 
in that kind of style which produces the effect against which 
the laws were intended to guard, without infringing the laws 
themselves. On the first day of the present session of Parliament the King was personally insulted, the glass of his coach 
was broken by a stone, and it is the fashion here to say, that his life was aimed at. 
</p><p>
This was probably not the case. In the present state of 
things the life of the king can be no object to the party hostile to the government. An assassination would do them 
great injury, and could be of no possible advantage. But to prove that he may be insulted with impunity is, doubtless, 
a point of consequence to those who found their hopes of a Revolution on the degradation of the royal character. 
</p><p>
Whatever the fact or the intention really was, it has been 
the occasion of two bills introduced by the Ministers now 
pending, one in the House of Lords, and the other in the 
House of Commons. Their professed objects are the security 
of the King's person and the prevention of seditious meetings 
and assemblies ; but their operation must be to abridge very 
materially the right of political discussion, and the public 
voice in the capital is strongly decided against them. In 
my next letter I shall give a further account of the proceedings on this subject, which becomes interesting from the uncommon degree of the public attention it has excited, and 
in the interval remain, with perfect respect, Sir, etc.
