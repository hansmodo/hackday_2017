My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I should have been glad to have accompanied Mr Custis, <a href='/results.php?tla=' rel=''>Mrs Washington</a>'s son, who is so kind as to 
take charge of this; but I cannot be ready in less 
than a week or ten days. 
</p><p>
The late bad weather drove that detachment of the enemy, that was posted on Valentine's hill, into the city, and they now confine themselves within Kingsbridge. 
The detachment in Jersey from which there are daily 
desertions of two or three, have not yet returned ; but 
they have contracted themselves, and seemed to be 
wholly employed in collecting and carrying off their 
spoil. Deserters inform us that they have indiscriminately taken every kind of grain, Indian corn, stock 
and all. One of the vessels burnt by our parties, had 
stalls fitted up for twelve horses, and ample provision of water for a sea voyage. "We have repeated 
accounts of the sickliness of Byron's crews. The 
report of their disorder being contagious is without 
foundation, as well as that of the British fleets having 
put to sea in quest of the French. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a> who arrived in camp yesterday, 
gives us an account of Captain Barry's having lost his 
frigate two days after he sailed from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. He 
engaged a British 32 gun frigate and had fought her 
with his usual bravery, and great prospect of success ; 
his men and officers being sworn not to surrender; 
when a 64 gun ship came up and put an end to the 
contest; but not before he had given two or three 
such fires as Barry's situation, relatively to the British 
frigate, allowed. Our brave captain then avoided violating his oath by running his ship on shoar at Seal 
island, and keeping up a fire from four guns which he 
brought to bear in his stern, till he got out his boats 
and some baggage. He made his escape with eighty 
hands ; the rest were to shift for themselves by land 
ing. Ten who concealed themselves have escaped 
since; one, an Englishman, remained on board and 
extinguished the fire which Barry put to the ship in 
order to destroy her, by which means she was saved, 
and the enemy got her oft .

If the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> goes to Europe, it is 
probable that he will take a great many of his countrymen with him. It is almost certain that many of 
them will be very troublesome to Congress for certificates. Duplessis applied to me the other day to 
obtain him a furlough for <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and to give 
him a certificate of his having behaved well at the 
battle of Monmouth, that he might go and signify his 
design to Congress of retiring from service. 
</p><p>
I replied that he had no need of an introduction to 
the President if he had any business with Congress, 
that he already had a most honourable certificate 
from them, and that if he wanted a final certificate at 
going away, the Commander in chief was the proper person to apply to. The commissions which Congress 
have applied so liberally have destroyed the value of 
rank which is the ostensible reward of merit, and 
have done great injustice to many brave and experienced officers who have found themselves on a par 
with, or but one remove from some of their country 
men who had no pretensions to rank of any kind. 
The only reparation that can be made, and it is but a 
feeble one, is to be sparing in the testimonials to be 
given at their departure, and to make a pointed difference between those which are given to men of real 
merit, and those which are the effect only of political management. 
</p><p>
You will be so good as to excuse my mentioning 
these matters ; they have occasioned great disgust in 
foreigners conscious of their worth, much uneasiness 
in our native officers, and have brought rank into 
disgrace. In a few days I shall have an opportunity 
of speaking more fully on this subject and many 
others if you permit, when I have the happiness of 
embracing you in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. I am anxious to receive a letter from you in the meantime, and begin to 
count the hours which are to precede my setting out. 
</p><p>
My dearest friend and father, 
</p><p>
Adieu.

The purchasing commissioners complain of the 
scarcity of Hour. Some persons high in public office, 
are accused of the detestable crime of monopolizing. 
Is there no means of bringing their villainy to light, 
and expelling them from all share of the people's 
confidence. 
</p><p>
His Excellency, Henry Laurens, Esq., 
</p><p>
President of Congress, <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>.

(Private).
