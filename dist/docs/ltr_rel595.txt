<i>[Biographer's note: In addition to his duties as college president, my father had to make
all the arrangements for his new home.  The house assigned him by the
college was occupied by Dr. Madison, who was to move out as soon as
he could.  Carpenters, painters and glaziers had to be put to work
to get it into condition; furniture, carpets, bedding to be provided,
a cook procured, servants and provisions supplied.</i>

My mother was an invalid and absent, and as my sisters were with her,
everything down to the minutest details was done by my father's
directions and under his superintendence.  He had always been noted
for his care and attention to the little things, and that trait,
apparent in him when a mere lad, practised all through his busy and
eventful life, stood him in good stead now.  The difficulties to be
overcome were made greater by the scarcity and inaccessibility of
supplies and workmen and the smallness of his means.  In addition,
he conducted a large correspondence, always answering every letter.
To every member of his family he wrote continually, and was interested
in all our pursuits, advising and helping us as no one else could
have done.  Some of his letters to my mother at this time show how he
looked into every matter, great or small, which related to her comfort
and welfare, and to the preparation of her new home.  For example,
on October 9th he writes:]</i>

<q>...Life is indeed gliding away and I have nothing of good to show for
mine that is past.  I pray I may be spared to accomplish something for
the benefit of mankind and the honour of God....  I hope I may be able
to get the house prepared for you in time to reach here before the
cold weather.  Dr. Madison has sent me word that he will vacate the
house on the 16th inst., this day week.  I will commence to make some
outside repairs this week, so as to get at the inside next, and hope
by the 1st of November it will be ready for you.  There is no furniture
belonging to the house, but we shall require but little to commence
with.  Mr. Green, of Alexandria, to whom I had written, says that his
manufacturing machinery, etc., has been so much injured that, although
it has been returned to him, he cannot resume operations until next
year, but that he will purchase for us anything we desire.  I believe
nothing is manufactured in Richmond--everything comes from the North,
and we might as well write to Baltimore at once for what we want.
What do you think?  I believe nothing of consequence is manufactured
here.  I will see this week what can be done....</q>
