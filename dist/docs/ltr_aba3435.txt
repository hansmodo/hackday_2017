MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
I suppose you wish to hear from me and from your 
little boy. He is very well, and very amusing, as 
usual ; talks of William, and of the other papa ; is 
as fond as ever of the " fosses," and has a great addition to his amusement and pleasures from a flock 
of sheep, which are daily pastured by a shepherd and 
his dog upon the lawn in front of our house. Bush 
Hill, as it is called, though by the way there remains neither bush nor shrub upon it, and very few 
trees, except the pine grove behind it, yet Bush 
Hill is a very beautiful place. But the grand and 
sublime I left at Richmond Hill. The cultivation in 
sight and prospect are superior, but the Schuylkill is 
no more like the Hudson, than I to Hercules. The 
house is better finished within ; but, when you come 
to compare the conveniences for store-room, kitchen, 
closets, <&c, there is nothing like it in the whole 
house. As chance governs many actions of my 
life, when we arrived in the city, we proceeded to 
the house. By accident, the vessel, with our furniture, had arrived the day before, and Briesler was 
taking in the first load into a house all green-painted, 
the workmen there with their brushes in hand. 
This was a cold comfort in a house, where I suppose 
no fire had been kindled for several years, except in 
a back kitchen ; but, as I expected many things of 
this kind, I was not disappointed nor discomfited. 
As no wood nor fodder had been provided beforehand, we could only turn about, and go to the City 
Tavern for the night. 
</p><p>
The next morning was pleasant, and I ventured 
to come up and take possession ; but what confusion ! Boxes, barrels, chairs, tables, trunks, 6cc. ; 
every thing to be arranged, and few hands to accomplish it, for Briesler was obliged to be at the vessel. 
The first object was to get fires ; the next to get up 
beds ; but the cold, damp rooms, the new paint, 
&c, proved almost too much for me. On Friday 
we arrived here, and late on Saturday evening we 
got our furniture in. On Sunday, Thomas was laid 
up with the rheumatism ; on Monday, I was obliged 
to give Louisa an emetic ; on Tuesday, Mrs. Briesler was taken with her old pain in her stomach ; 
and, to complete the whole, on Thursday, Polly was 
seized with a violent pleuritic fever. She has been 
twice bled, a blister upon her side, and has not been 
out of bed since, only as she is taken up to have her 
bed made. And every day, the stormy ones excepted, from eleven until three, the house is filled 
with ladies and gentlemen. As all this is no more 
nor worse than I expected, I bear it without repining, 
and feel thankful that I have weathered it out without 
a relapse, though some days I have not been able to 
sit up. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Bingham has been twice to see me. I think 
she is more amiable and beautiful than ever. I have 
seen many very fine women since I have been here. 
Our Nancy Hamilton is the same unaffected, affable 
girl we formerly knew her. She made many kind inquiries after you ; so did Mrs. Bingham. I have not 
yet begun to return visits, as the ladies expect to find 
me at home, and I have not been in a state of health 
to do it ; nor am yet in a very eligible state to receive 
their visits. I, however, endeavoured to have one 
room decent to receive them, which, with my own 
chamber, is as much as I can boast of, at present, 
being in tolerable order. The difficulty of getting 
workmen, Mr. Hamilton pleads as an excuse for the 
house not being ready. Mrs. Lear was in to see me 
yesterday, and assures me that I am much better off 
than Mrs. Washington will be when she arrives, for 
that their house is not likely to be completed this 
year. And, when all is done, it will not be Broadway. If <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> wanted any revenge for the 
removal, the citizens might be glutted if they would 
come here, where every article has become almost 
double in price, and where it is not possible for 
Congress, and the appendages, to be half as well accommodated for a long time. One would suppose 
that the people thought Mexico was before them, and 
that Congress were the possessors.

23 November. Sunday. 
</p><p>
I wrote you thus far on Sunday last. Polly is on 
the recovery, but your brother Thomas is very ill, 
and almost helpless with the rheumatism. You recollect how he formerly had it. It seems as if sickness followed me wherever I go. The President got 
to town on Saturday ; I have not yet seen him or 
Mrs. Washington. We have had two severe storms ; 
the last was snow. Poor Mrs. Knox is in great 
tribulation about her furniture. The vessel sailed the 
day before the first storm, and had not been heard of 
on Friday last. I had a great misfortune happen to 
my best trunk of clothes = The vessel sprung a leak, 
and my trunk got wet a foot high, by which means I 
have several gowns spoiled ; and the one you worked 
is the most damaged, and a black satin ; the blessed 
effects of tumbling about the world. Adieu. Write 
me soon. Love to all.
