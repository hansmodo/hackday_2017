</p><p>
SIR: I have received your letter of the 2d instant, enclosing a copy of your 
letter to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>, of the 31st ultimo, and his reply thereto, all which I 
have duly noted. 
</p><p>
You have requested a copy of Mr. Calhoun's letter to me of the 29th of 
May last, for the purpose of its being shown to Mr. Crawford. Mr. Calhoun, in his reply to you, does not consent, nor yet object, to your being furnished with a copy, but refers the matter to my discretion. 
</p><p>
A copy of the original letter of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> to you having been submitted to me, it occurred as being proper and correct that you should be 
apprised of Mr. Calhoun's answer, and therefore it was shown to you. I 
cannot, on reflection, perceive any impropriety in now according to you 
the request you have made, particularly as, on your referring this matter to 
Mr. Calhoun, he does not object. I accordingly send it, with this injunction, 
that it be used for no other purpose but the one you have stated, to be 
shown to Mr. Crawford. 
</p><p>
In the letter which you have addressed to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>, you state as follows, to wit: &lt;* Having, at the request of the President to be informed what 
took place in the cabinet of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Monroe</a> on the subject of the Seminole 
campaign, laid before him a copy (except the omission of a name) of a letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>," &c. &c. This is construed by Mr. Calhoun into 
a declaration that I requested you to furnish me with the information. I 
am satisfied it was not by you so intended, and I would be glad you would 
so explain it to him. I never conversed with you upon this subject previous to the time when you sent me Mr. Crawford's letter. The facts are 
these: I had been informed that Mr. Crawford had made a statement concerning this business, which had come to the knowledge of Col. James A. 
Hamilton, of New York. On meeting with Col. Hamilton, I inquired of 
him, and received for answer that he had, but remarked that he did not 
think it proper to communicate without the consent of the writer. I answered, that, being informed that the Marshal of this District had, to a 
friend of mine, made a similar statement to that said to have been made 
by Mr. Crawford, I would be glad to see Mr. Crawford's statement, and 
desired he would write and obtain his consent. My reasons were, that I 
had, from the uniform friendly professions of Mr. Calhoun, always believed 
him my friend in all this Seminole business; and I had a desire to know if 
in this I had been mistaken, and whether il was possible for Mr. Calhoun 
to have acted with such insincerity and duplicity towards me. 
</p><p>
I have enclosed <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> a copy of this letter; 
</p><p>
And am, Sir, with respectful regard, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

The Hon. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">JOHN FORSYTH</a>, Senator in Congress.
