</p><p>
MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ezk" rel="met friend">LIZZIE</a> : My ink is like myself and 
my spirits failing, so I write you to-day with a pencil. I had a solitary ride to this place, as you 
may imagine, varied by one or two amusing incidents. I found, after you left me, I could not continue in the car in which you left me, owing to 
every seat s berth being engaged ; so, being simple Mrs. Clarke, I had to eat humble-pie in a carless commodious. My thoughts were too much 
with my dry goods and interests at 609 Broadway, to care much for my surroundings, as uncomfortable as they were. In front of me sat 
a middle-aged, gray-haired, respectable-looking gentleman, who, for the whole morning, had the 
page of the World before him which contained my letters and business concerns. About four 
hours before arriving at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">CHICAGO</a>, a consequential-looking man, of formidable size, seated himself 
by him, and it appears they were entirely unknown to each other. The well-fed looking individual opened the conversation with the man 
who- had read the World so attentively, and the conversation soon grew warm and earnest. The 
war and its devastation engaged them. The bluffy individual, doubtless a Republican who had 
pocketed his many thousands, spoke of the widows of the land, made so by the war. My reading man remarked to him : 
</p><p>
Are you aware that Mrs. Lincoln is in indigent circumstances, and has to sell her clothing 
and jewelry to gain means to make life more endurable? 
</p><p>
The well-conditioned man replied : I do not blame her for selling her clothing, if she wishes it. 
I suppose when sold she will convert the proceeds into five-twenties to enable her to have means to be buried. 
</p><p>
The World man turned towards him with a searching glance, and replied, with the haughtiest manner : That woman is not dead yet. 
</p><p>
The discomfited individual looked down, never spoke another word, and in half an hour left his seat, and did not return. 
</p><p>
I give you word for word as the conversation occurred. May it be found through the execution of my friends, Messrs Brady and Keyes, that 
that woman is not yet dead, and being alive, she speaketh and gaineth valuable hearers. Such 
is life! Those who have been injured, how gladly the injurer would consign them to mother earth 
and forgetfulness ! Hoping I should not be recognized at Fort Wayne, I thought I would get 
out at dinner for a cup of tea. * * * will show you what a creature of fate I am, as miserable as it sometimes is. I went into the diningroom alone, and was ushered up to the table, 
where, at its head, sat a very elegant-looking gentleman at his side a middle-aged lady. My 
black veil was doubled over my face. I had taken my seat next to him he at the head of the 
table, I at his left hand. I immediately/*^ a pair of eyes was gazing at me. I looked 
him full in the face, and the glance was earnestly returned. I sipped my water, and said : Mr. S., 
is this indeed you ? His face was as pale as the table-cloth. We entered into conversation, when 
I asked him how long since he had left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chicago" rel="city">CHICAGO</a>. He replied, Two weeks since. He said, How strange you should be on the train and I not know it! 
</p><p>
As soon as I could escape from the table, I did so by saying, I must secure a cup of tea for a 
lady friend with me who has a head-ache. I had scarcely returned to the car, when he entered 
it with a cup of tea borne by his own aristocratic hands. I was a good deal annoyed by seeing 
him, and he was so agitated that he spilled half of the cup over my elegantly gloved hands. He 
looked very sad, and I fancied 609 Broadway occupied his thoughts. I apologized for the absent lady who wished the cup, by saying that 
* in my absence she had slipped out for it. His heart was in his eyes, notwithstanding my veiled 
face. Pity for me, I fear, has something to do with all this. I never saw his manner so gentle 
and sad. This was nearly evening, and I did not see him again, as he returned to the lady, who 
was his sister-in-law from the East. * What evil spirit possessed me to go out and get 
that cup of tea ? When he left me, woman-like I tossed the cup of tea out of the window, and 
tucked my head down and shed hitter tears. At the depot my darling little Taddie was waiting for me, and his voice never sounded so sweet. 
</p><p>
*My dear Lizzie do visit Mr. Brady each morning at nine o clock, and urge them all 
you can. I see by the papers Stewart has returned. To-morrow I will send the invoice of 
goods, which please to not give up. How much I miss you, tongue cannot tell. Forget my fright 
and nervousness of the evening before. Of course you were as innocent as a child in all you 
did. I consider you my best living friend, and I am struggling to be enabled some day to repay you. Write me often, as you promised. 
</p><p>
Always truly yours, 
</p><p>
