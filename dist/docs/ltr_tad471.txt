Dear Brother
</p><p>
   I take this oppertunity to write you
a few to let you no that I am well and get
along well their is not sine of a move at
this time the weather here has been fine.
yesterday their was some rain but did last long.
I received John letter a few Days ago I though
I was not going to get any word from home
and was much peased to here and was
much obliged to John for [ for] the stamp and
sheat of paper I cant neathe paper or stamp
here and I want you to write and send them
to me accationaly I can by paper at 2 cents
a sheat I think I can't stand them prices well
their was some talk a few days ago of our
being sent back to Washington but I think
their is nothing of it if whe are moved it will
be towards the river it takes a good Deal
of figering to live here as the feed is hard
to eat but by taking cair in the cooking
whe still make it go down.
If I had som of the apples that are at home I would have
some fine dishes of saws and apple fliters I
have been very hungry since I have been here
by time but I think I will be able to see it
through as their is but about 3 & 1/2 months
[unclear: illeg.] has just been here and say I
shall tell you he is will but [unclear: times are tuff]
and sends his respects to all is a good thing
the health of the company is good [unclear: thare have]
been [unclear: some] of thoes sent to the hospital
that have been sent on [unclear: here are going at]
convalesant camp at Alaxandria. I hope
they will stay their as the hardships is hard
to get through and their is more in the company
[unclear: that wants to go home] .
I suppose you have been enjoying yoursalf fine
but if their is no more snow their than their is
here the sleigh wont mount to much this Regt
is very much cut Down at prisant their is but [unclear: 315]
men in it my paper is most full and I must stop
I got some Tobacco seed whe I was out in picket
the other Day I will send it in this and I want you tents which are some protection but the
weather has been fine I think I never
saw such good weather this time a year
Their was some talk that in camp that this Brigade
would be sent back but their has
been nothing said the last few days so I dont think
their is much in it I [unclear: wish] whe would go back
a piece for their would be some chance
to By something to eat their is no chance to get
any thing here neathe paper nor postage stamps
as you will see this is ritten on an old piece
of copy book that was picked up [unclear: [illeg.] main]
and if I have to maile this and leave you the
postage to pay you must excuse me or else
I [unclear: [illeg.]] [unclear: change our position] Their
is several that I would like to write to if I had
the paper their is no sutlers supplies alowed
to be shiped as the armies is so large that it require
all the transportation the government can raise to
bring up supplys their is no much chance for
a forward move from here as the Rebels seam to
bee very well Situated on the other side of the Rappahanook is but a Small river some
paces it is so shalow that it is easely forded
the pickets talk to each other from the banks
of the stream their is no firing amonkst the
pickets but a few evenings they wer Driven in
which put the officers on their gard I think I will stop
writing about the armie and tell you that what part
of Virginia [ I] have seen it looks offel hard it is
nothing but a lot of hill and the poorist land I have
most ever seen their is a great deal of this scruby
Pine and seder grows here most all the farms
are vacated the inhabitants gon south with the
exception of some few Negros that are scatered about
I wish I [ who] could have been at home to have
tended singing the last three evenings as they have
been fine and I suppose you had a good time
I want you to write to me and give me all
the new and let me no how the singing is [ going]
geting along I wrote to David Early some time ago
have not herd from him yet my paper is most full
my best Respects to your Parents and all that inquire
and I Remain
