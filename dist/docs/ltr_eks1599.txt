[Giving an account of the battles of the eighth and 
ninth named Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma.] On 
the seventh we left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Point Isabel" rel="city">Point Isabel</a> and lay on our arms 
after marching seven miles. On the morning of the 
eighth we moved on steadily and at a little before 
twelve the enemy were reported in force some miles 
in our advance. We pushed on and by two o clock 
deployed in order of battle, the Mexicans showing 
themselves in line in much superior numbers. At 
three they opened their batteries upon us but I 
cannot detail at this time. Suffice it to say, that all 
behaved gallantly, the Fifth sustaining the only 
cavalry charge made during the day. Captain John 
Page was mortally wounded, Major Ringgold desperately. Many slight wounds were received, and a 
considerable number of the rank and file killed. We 
bivouacked on the field, and on the morning of the 
ninth, after a council of war, we pushed forward, the 
enemy showing their force in rear of their original 
position. They retired as we advanced, and the entire 
battle field was examined. At least eighty of their 
dead were found, besides many large graves. The 
prisoners reported their force as seventy-five hundred. 
At twelve we went ahead rapidly, and at three o clock 
we engaged the foe in an entrenched camp three or 
four miles from the fort. Here ensued the most 
desperate and bloody fight our army has known since 
1812.

The fight lasted until near night, when we were 
completely victorious, the enemy totally routed with 
the loss of all their cannon, baggage, etc. Much of 
the fight was desperate, personal, hand-to-hand encounters, but the eager courage of our men overcame 
superior numbers and drove them from their strong 
position. Many hundreds have fallen, the loss of the 
Mexicans has been terrific. Their dead are strewed 
over the whole field. We have five officers killed, and 
twelve wounded, Colonel Mclntosh desperately, and 
Captain Hove will lose his right arm. Edmund 
and myself, though in the thickest of the fight men 
falling around us on all sides were unhurt. All 
have behaved as if the word fear was not in their 
vocabularies. General La Vega and many others are 
prisoners. Such a victory is hardly on record. I 
cannot write another word now but will give you 
a thousand particulars when I have leisure.
