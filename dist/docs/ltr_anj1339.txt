</p><p>
SIR: Your letter of the 22d June last has just been received, via <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a> city. I regret that mine to you of the 7th of May covering a copy of 
one to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">Mr. Forsyth</a> from me of the same date, had not reached you, as it 
would have prevented you from falling into the gross errors you have, from 
the unfounded inferences you have drawn from Mr. Forsyth's letter to me, 
and would have informed you that I had no conversation or communication 
with Mr. Forsyth on the subject alluded to, before the receipt of the copy 
of Mr. Crawford's latter, which I so promptly laid before you. To correct the errors into which the inferences you have drawn from Mr. Forsyth's letter have led you, I herewith again enclose you a copy of my letter 
to Mr. Forsyth of the 7th of May, and his answer thereto of the 17th June 
last, which I received on the 8th instant, and I have to regret that any interruption of the mail prevented your receipt of mine of the 7th of May, 
which was mailed the same time mine to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">Mr. Forsyth</a> was. 
</p><p>
Mr. Forsyth having promised, in his letter to me of the 17th June, that 
he would explain, and by letter correct you in the unjust and unfounded 
inferences which you had drawn from his letter; and I must add here, for 
your information, that, if I understood your other allusions, they are as 
equally unfounded. I have never heard it even intimated, except in your 
letter, that the individual to whom I suppose you allude had the slightest 
knowledge on the subject, or the most remote agency in the matter. In 
conclusion, I repeat, I have always met the intimations of your having 
made before the cabinet, in secret council, against me, injurious movements, 
with flat and positive denial, and brought into view, by way of rebutter, 
your uniform and full approval of my whole conduct on the Seminole campaign, so far as I, or any of my friends, had heard you on the subject; and 
the high character you sustained for fair, open, and honorable conduct in all 
things was entirely opposed to the secret, uncandid, and unmanly course 
ascribed to you by those intimations, and I banished from my mind what I 
conceived to be unjust imputations upon your honor, by ascribing duplicity 
to you, and never, until after the intimations were communicated to me of 
the suggestions of the Marshal, as stated in my letter to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">Mr. Forsyth</a>, (a copy 
of which was enclosed to you.) It was then that I had a desire so see the 
statement said to have been made by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>, and, when information 
(informed) by Colonel Hamilton that such statements had been seen in 
writing, that I made the request to see it, with the object of laying it before 
you, which I then supposed would meet your prompt and positive negative. 
But I regret that instead of a negative, which I had a right to expect, I had 
the poignant mortification to see in your letter an admission of its truth. 
Understanding the matter now, I feel no interest in this altercation, and 
leave you and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>, and all concerned, to settle the affair in your 
own way, and now close this correspondence for ever. 
I am, very respectfully, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
