Sir, 
</p><p>
The success of the proposed enterprise, must depend on the absence of the British fleet, the secrecy 
of the attempt, and a knowledge of the exact situation of the enemy. If, after you have been at the 
westward, the circumstances, from your intelligence, 
shall still appear favorable, you will be at liberty to 
be the bearer of the enclosed letter to the Count de 
Rochambeau, to whose determination I have referred 
the matter ; as any cooperation on our part, by moving 
troops towards the Sound, would give such indications 
of the design, as would effectually frustrate the success. Should you not proceed to the Count, you may 
destroy that letter. If, on the contrary, you should 
go to Newport, by keeping an account of the expenses, 
they will be repaid by the public. 
</p><p>
In the mean time, I wish you to be as particular as 
possible, m obtaining from your friend an accurate 
account of the enemy's strength on York, Long, and 
Staten Islands, specifying the several corps and their 
distributions. This, I think, from the enemy's present 
weak state, may be procured with more facility and 
accuracy than at any former period. I wish to know, 
also, the strength of the last detachment from New 
York, and of what troops it was composed. 
</p><p>
I need scarcely suggest, if you should go eastward, 
that it will be expedient to do it in such a manner as 
not to create suspicion. Indeed, secrecy is absolutely 
necessary in the whole affair. As <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> does not understand English, it may be well to 
communicate your business to the Chevalier de Chastellux in the first instance, and through him to the Coimt, lest it should accidentally get abroad in the 
communication. I am, &c. 
</p>
