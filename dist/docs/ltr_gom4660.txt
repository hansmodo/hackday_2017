My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
When yours of the twenty-eighth of January reached me, 
(long after it was written) the war with Spain, with (but to 
cut short all enumeration,) the European world, put it out 
of my power to send you an answer. I write now merely to 
take the chances which may offer, and to tell you that I stil 
exist. I will tell you further, that I am here on the banks of 
the Seine, in a neat little house, in a pretty little garden, with 
some green trees, and more green grass than my neighbors, 
for you will observe, that we are so scorched by a long 
drought, that, in spite of all philosophic notions, we are beginning our processions to obtain the favor of the bon Dieu. 
</p><p>
Were it proper for un homme public et protestant to interfere, I should be tempted to tell them, that mercy is before 
sacrifice. I remember that about a year (or indeed eighteen 
months) ago, I was desired in a large society to draw the horoscope of France, to which I answered, that it might be done 
in three words Guerre, Famine, Peste. This, which appeared 
to me at the time more than possible, has long been certain as 
to a part, and but too probable for what remains. I pray God 
the prediction be not fully accomplished. 
</p><p>
I will not speak to you of news or of politics, because I will 
give no temptation to interrupt my letter, and because the 
contents would not deserve the name of news, when they 
should happen to arrive. Adieu, my dear Sir.
