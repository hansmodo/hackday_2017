I HAVE three I of your favors before me. One of 
May 7, another of May 9, and a third of May 14th. 
The last has given me relief from many anxieties. It 
relates wholly to private affairs, and contains such an 
account of wise and prudent management, as makes 
me very happy. I begin to be jealous, that our neighbors will think affairs more discreetly conducted in my 
absence, than at any other time. Whether your suspicions concerning a letter under a marble cover are 
just or not, it is best to say little about it It is a 
hasty,* hurried thing, and of no great consequence, 
calculated for a meridian at a great distance from 
New England. If it has done no good, it will do 
no harm. It has contributed to set people thinking 
upon the subject, and in this respect has answered its 
end. The manufacture of governments having, since 
the publication of that letter, been as much talked of, 
as that of saltpetre was before.

I rejoice at your account of the spirit of fortification, and the good effects of it I hope, by this time, 
you are in a tolerable posture of defence. The in 
habitants of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> have done themselves great honor 
by their laudable zeal, the clergymen, especially. 
</p><p>
I think you shine as a stateswoman of late, as well as 
a farmeress. Pray where do you get your maxims of 
state ? They are very apropos. I am much obliged 
to Judge Gushing and his lady for their polite visit to 
you. I should be very happy to see him, and con 
verse with him about many things, but cannot hope 
for that pleasure very soon. The afiairs of America 
are in so critical a state, such great events are struggling into birth that I must not quit this station at this 
time. Yet I dread the melting heats of a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> summer, and know not how my frail constitution 
will endure it. Such constant care, such incessant application of mind, drinking up and exhausting the 
finer spirits, upon which life and health so essentially depend, will wear away a stronger man than I am. 
Yet I will not shrink from this danger or this toil. While my health shall be such, that I can discharge, 
-in any tolerable manner, the duties of this important post, I will not desert it.

I am pleased to hear that the superior court is to sit at Ipswich in June. This will contribute to give 
stability to the government, I hopc^ift all its branches. 
But I presume other steps will be taken for this purpose. A Governor, and Lieutenant Governor, I hope, 
will be chosen, and the Constitution a little more fixed. I hope too, that the council will, this year, be more 
full, and augmented by the addition of good men. I hope Mr. Bowdoin will be Governor, if his health will 
permit, and Doctor Winthrop, Lieutenant Governor. These are wise, learned and prudent men. The first 
has a great fortune and wealthy connexions. The other has the advantage of a name and family which 
is much reverenced, besides his personal abilities and virtues, which are very great. ;

Our friend, I I sincerely hope, will not refuse his appointment. For although I have ever thought that 
bench should be filled from the bar, and once labored successfully to effect it, yet as the gentlemen have seen 
fit to decline, I know of no one who would do more honor to the station, than my friend. None 
would be so agreeable to me, whether I am to sit by him or before him. I suppose it must be disagreeable 
to him and his lady, because he loves to be upon his farm, and they both love to be together. But you 
must tell them of a couple of their friends, who are as fond of living together, who are obliged to sacrifice 
their rural amusements and domestic happiness to the requisitions of the public. 
</p><p>
The Generals, Washington, Gates and Mifllin are all here, and we shall derive spirit, unanimity and vigor 
from their presence and advice. I hope you will have some general officers at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> soon. I am, with constant wishes and prayers for your health and prosperity, forever yours.

James Warren.
