Mr DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ezk" rel="met friend">LIZZIE</a>: Although I am suffering with a fearful headache to-day, yet, as your note 
of Wednesday is received, I must write. I am grieved to find that you are so wretchedly low-spirited. * * * On Wednesday, the 20th 
of Kovember, K. sent me the telegram I send you. If he is not in earnest, what does it mean ? What 
is the rate of expenses that B. has gone to in my business, that he dares to withhold my immense 
amount of goods ? Do you believe they intend sending out those circulars ? Of course you will 
be well rewarded if we have any success, but as to $500 f now, I have it not for myself, or any one 
else. Pray, what does B. propose to charge for his expenses? I pray God there will be some 
success, although, dear Lizzie, entirely between ourselves, I fear I am in villanous hands. As to 
money, I haven t it for myself just now, even if nothing comes in. When I get my things back, 
if ever, from , I will send you some of those dresses to dispose of at Washington for your own 
benefit. If we get something, you will find that promises and performance for this life will be forth 
coming. * * It is mysterious why B. NEVER writes, and K. once, perhaps, in 
three weeks. All this is very strange. *
