Sir, 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor of inclosing to you a certificate from Judge Wilson, of my having qualified as 
Secretary of State. A duplicate is deposited among 
the files of the office. 
</p><p>
I must entreat you. Sir, to receive my very affectionate acknowledgments for the various instances of 
your confidence, and to be assured that, let the consequence be what it may, in this office no consideration of party shall ever influence me. Nothing shall 
relax my attention or warp my probity; and it shall 
be my unremitted study to become an accurate master of this new and important business. At the commencement of my duties, I have thought it advisable to write to the Secretaries of the Treasury and 
of War, and to the President of the Bank of the 
United States, the letters of which the inclosed are 
copies. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=edr" rel="me">Edmund Randolph</a>.
