WE were greatly disappointed yesterday, that we had not 
the Pleasure, promised us, of our dear Polly's Company. 
Your good Mother would have me write a Line in Answer to 
your Letter. A Muse, you must know, visited me this Morning! I see you are surpriz'd, as I was. I never saw one 
before. And shall never see another. So I took the Opportunity of her Help to put the Answer into Verse, because I 
was some Verse in your Debt ever since you sent me the last 
Pair of Garters.

This Muse appeared to be no Housewife. I suppose few 
of them are. She was drest (if the Expression is allowable) 
in an Undress, a kind of slatternly Negligee, neither neat nor 
clean, norwell made ; and she has given the same sort of Dress 
to my Piece. On reviewing it, I would have reform'd the 
Lines, and made them all of a Length, as I am told Lines 
ought to be ; but I find I can't lengthen the short ones without 
stretching them on the Rack, and I think it would be equally 
cruel to cut off any Part of the long ones. Besides the Superfluity of these makes up for the Deficiency of those; and so, 
from a Principle of Justice, I leave them at full Length, that 
I may give you, at least in one Sense of the Word, good 
Measure. Adieu, my dear good Girl, and believe me ever 
your affectionate, faithful Friend,
