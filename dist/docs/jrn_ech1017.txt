Night before last it rained during the greater part of the night and the following
forenoon, consequently we made a late start yesterday morning. The small stream upon which we were encamped had to be forded. When everything was ready, I put on my long gum boots and waded through the water which was over knee deep. I then sat down on the bank and threw the boots over to McCowan, who crossed as I had done. Atkins, who was not well, was permitted to cross in the wagon.The stream being crossed, we pushed ahead on our tiresome journey, halting about one o'clock to take a bite of something to eat. And oh, how tired we were! We soon however straightened our weary limbs and proceeded on our journey. About four o'clock we reached Capt. Hardie's Ferry where we crossed the San Joaquin, by unloading the wagon and taking the baggage across in a whale boat. The wagon had to be taken apart and crossed on a barge. The cattle were swam over. For this service our teamster paid half an ounce and as it would have cost us one dollar each, we concluded to lighten his expense if he included us in his family for the time being. We therefore paid the dollar apiece to him instead of the ferryman.
<p></p>
Here we overtook teams from Texas and Arkansas and moved on a mile or two to get to good camping ground. Before we reached our stopping place we had to cross several sloughs. In one of these our team came very near sticking. Atkins crossed on the wagon. When in the middle of the stream, our camp kettle, in which our provisions for the journey were stored, took a notion to slip off the guide-pole upon which it was hanging, and to our utter horror we saw it going down the stream. It was soon rescued however, from the watery element, and our "bread and dinner" saved. Mack and I had to wade again, but here the boots were of no
avail for the water was too deep, coming up to our middles.
<p></p>
We soon reached camp, cooked our supper, and put our weary bodies to rest. My feet were blistered in a horrible manner. During the day we saw a drove of wild horses on the plain several miles distant.
<p></p>
This morning being beautiful, the train moved at an early hour, and after crossing a few more sloughs, reached a more elevated plain. Here we struck out a course and at the end of ten miles over which a civilized foot had probably never trod, we struck a wagon trail leading us on toward the Merced River. The greater part of the plain is quite sandy and very little vegetation upon it. We chased up a number of hare and several prairie wolves. In the afternoon we saw a very large grey wolf lying dead on the road. While away from its mountain home it had been unfortunate enough to fall in with some hunter. About sunset we came to good camping ground.
<p></p>
Hardie's Ferry is 25 miles from San Joaquin City and our camp is 20 miles from the ferry. You may therefore well know that the day's tramp has been no benefit to sore feet and aching bones. We had not laid in a sufficient stock of provisions and this evening I purchased a chunk of meat of Mr. Cox for $1.25, which is now (eight P.M.) over the fire, stewing. We are in sight of the celebrated Sierra Nevada, whose high peaks are covered with snow the whole year round.
