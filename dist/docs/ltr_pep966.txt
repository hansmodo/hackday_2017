My Dear Christman:--This is Sunday morning and West Chester wears the usual quiet air.
</p><p>
The old Record is moving along with increased patronage. We have a person out in the county constantly hunting up subscribers. Mr. Evans is busy with politics. His chances are good for nomination. Your paper is regularly received and I am pleased and amused with its contents.

The past week in West Chester has been one of great excitement. The Spring Exhibition of the Horticultural Society came off. We also had a company of Oregon Indians to amuse and initiate us into the customs and habits of the Indian. Several thousand people must have visited West Chester from different parts of the county, among whom were some of the prettiest ladies ever allowed to live. I saw Ellen there. I am sorry you were not with us to share some of the fun and see the pretty girls.

Your brother Jefferson has been with Samuel Evans about two months. He does not like West Chester very well, and like you and I were when we first came here, has been a little homesick. Jefferson is a smart boy.
</p><p>
Present my love to Clinton and tell him if he comes back to West Chester with a "pile," he will be formidable among the ladies. They are fond of the "rocks."
</p><p>
All hands bid me present their respects to you and say they would be pleased to see you in West Chester.
</p><p>
Your old friend
</p><p>
PRIZER.
