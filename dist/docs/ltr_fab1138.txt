WEAVERVILLE, July 26, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1853">1853</a>
</p><p>
I wrote you from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> and expected to find
letters from you here but our mail is very irregular now. You may have written and the letters not arrived. It is a very long time since I heard from you.
</p><p>
As near as I can recollect, I remained in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> six days; escorted a French lady to Weaverville, Madame De Borde. As all her expenses were paid by her friend in S.F. I had no objection to taking charge of her. Madame had never been out of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> and all the English she knew was 'Yes Sir' and 'Thank you, Sir.' My knowledge of French is very limited but we talked all the way. It is astonishing how soon you can learn a foreign tongue from a pretty pair of lips. I have paid a good deal of attention to Spanish and can read and speak it with ease. It is used a great deal in this country. Our packers are Mexicans, nearly altogether. And 'Juanita' does up my shirts and very well, too.

The fourth of July I was travelling. It was celebrated with a general drunk early in the morning, kept up at short intervals during the day and at night a grand ball in the new Court House. The first ball not being satisfactory to some, they had another the night following. Talk about our grandmothers, etc., in early times riding to parties and meetings--four ladies came over from Shasta, 40 miles, on mules, Saturday and Sunday. Monday they ran all over town, calling. At night they danced, ate and drank till two o'clock. The next day the same and dancing all night. They started home at daylight and rode 40 miles over the worst mountains you ever did see (in pictures).

I send you a view of our village which is pretty good. The mountains are not right, the valley being much larger than represented. Business is dull. Weather very hot. Snow is in great demand but the supply holds out and we enjoy cobblers, ice creams, etc. Our train came up from Colusa in nine days. Both men gave out with the
fever and ague and Cole and Fagg have gone down this morning to turn the mules out. While waiting at Colusa they lost our best mule and my Colt's 'Revolver' (lost $200), stolen by a dmd Dutchman.

Colusa is a beautiful place. Fine chance to go in swimming and abounds in Digger Indians and fleas. The dust and heat at this season of the year in the valley render it anything but pleasant to travel and one is glad to leave the plains and get into the mountains, where we have cool water and cool nights. I was five days coming up and every time that I come back I think we are farther out of the world than ever. I believe I shall not go down again until I leave for good. Weaverville, however, is a very pleasant place to live. I prefer it to any place short of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. I have made a great many pleasant acquaintances here and besides it is better to be a great man in a small place than nobody in a great city. We are settled down here and can't wind up our business in a short time. We live first-rate and I sometimes think I might as well get married and stay here. Mrs. Finley showed me a great chance in Marysville, a Miss May--very pretty but no dimes. Won't do. At Red Bluffs I saw the prettiest Mexican girl I have ever seen in the county. She is genuine Castillian, owns a train of mules and buys and loads them. We bought the flour she sent to Weaverville. I had a strong idea of offering myself and train, against her and her train, but Angelita told me she had a husband somewhere in the mines and she has a boy about five years old. So I didn't ask her.
