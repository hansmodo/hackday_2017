I often wonder how lies first came into the world, 
and whether those who originate them do not 
believe them as firmly as any one else would believe 
truth. Lying seems to be the common creed of children and servants.

Anna told me of having heard Lennice telling the 
other servants that she knew there were spirits, 
because I often talked to them. Every morning and 
evening I walked to the graveyard with a basket of 
flowers, and would sit by father's and Harry's 
graves and call their spirits to me; and they would 
all fly to me, and talk and sing with me for hours 
until I would tell them good-bye and go home, 
when they would go away too. I suppose the ignorant girl, having foundation enough from my frequent visits there, which were most often alone, 
made up the rest to account for my never seeming 
to like company out there. The fervent "Good 
Lord" with which the tale was received by the 
other servants, and the full credence they gave it, 
might have proved unpleasant if further circulated ; 
and I believe some members of the family found it 
necessary to put an end to it at once.

And speaking of the graveyard recalls something 
I heard for the first time last night. Miriam was 
telling me that Tiche had asked if we knew that Mr. Sparks had visited Harry's grave? That he had got 
a basket of flowers from the Davidsons, and had 
made their driver carry it for him. And the man had 
told her that, after filling the vases with roses, and 
spreading them over the grave, he had thrown him 
self on it with a shriek of despair, calling on Harry 
to forgive him; that it was only because forced by 
his father that he had killed him ; and calling on God 
to prove that he would give his life gladly to recall 
Harry's. The man thought him a raving maniac and 
fled in terror. Miriam asked Fanny if it was true, 
and she said yes; she had gathered the flowers for 
him herself.

I saw them there, but little knew whose hand had 
brought them. I perceived at once that they were 
not mine, and touched even to tears by so silent an 
offering from an unknown person, I said, " It is some 
woman's work; God bless the hand that laid them 
there." I cannot say how much that little tribute 
affected me. And, Mr. Sparks, I do not retract the 
blessing now. No! "God have mercy on him!" has 
been my prayer ever since I knew what an awful loss 
you had caused us. God knows that I never even 
desired this revenge remorse standing over his 
grave. It has ever been, "God pity and forgive ! " 
never yet for an instant, "God pursue and avenge!"
