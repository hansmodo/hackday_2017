Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
It is easy to say " thou shalt not steal," but to stop 
stealing puzzles the brains of hundreds of men and 
employs thousands of bailiffs, sheriffs, &c., &c. So you 
or Congress may command " slaves shall be free," but to 
make them free and see that they are not converted into 
thieves, idlers or worse is a difficult problem and will 
require much machinery to carry out. Our commissaries must be ordered to feed them and some provision 
must be made for the women and children. My order 
gives employment to say two thousand, all men. Now 
that is about ^ of a command. Extend that population 
to the whole army of 80,000 gives 10,000 slaves, and if 
we pay 10 dollars a month the estimate can be made. 
If the women and children are to be provided for, we 
must allow for their support of, say, one million. Where 
are they to get work ? Who is to feed them, clothe them, 
and house them ? 
</p><p>
We cannot now give tents to our soldiers and our 
wagon trains are a horrible impediment, and if we are to 
take along and feed the negroes who flee to us for refuge 
it will be an impossible task. You cannot solve this 
negro question in a day. 
</p><p>
Your brigade is not here. I think it is with Buell 
near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chattanooga" rel="city">Chattanooga</a>. The last I saw of them they were in 
Garfield's brigade at Shiloh. still I should be glad if you 
would come to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a> on a visit. Provided the southern army do not reach Kentucky or get into Maryland. 
In either of those events the people of the North must 
rise en masse with such weapons as they can get and 
repair to the frontier. . . . 
</p><p>
The people are always right. Of course, in the long 
run, because this year they are one thing, next year 
another. Do you say the people were right last year in 
saying, acting and believing that 30,000 were enough to 
hold Kentucky and carry on an offensive war against the 
South? " The People" is a vague expression. 
</p><p>
Here the people are not right because you are warring 
against them. People in the aggregate may be wrong. 
There is such a thing as absolute right and absolute 
wrong. And people may do wrong as well as right. Our 
people are always right, but another people may be and 
always are wrong. 
</p><p>
Affectionately your brother,
