DEAR SIR : I take this opportunity to acknowledge the receipt of Anthony Benezet's book against the slave trade. I thank you for it. It is not a 
little surprising that the professors of Christianity, whose chief excellence consists in softening the human heart, and in cherishing and improving its finer 
feelings, should encourage a practice so totally repugnant to the first impressions of right and wrong. What adds to the wonder is that this abominable 
practice has been introduced in the most enlightened ages. Times, that seem to have pretensions to boast of high improvements in the arts and sciences, and 
refined morality, have brought into general use, and guarded by many laws, a species of violence and tyranny, which our more rude and barbarous, but 
more honest ancestors detested. Is it not amazing, that at a time, when the rights of humanity are defined and understood with precision, in a country, 
above all others, fond of liberty, that in such an age and in such a country, we find men professing a religion the most humane, mild, gentle and generous, 
adopting a principle as repugnant to humanity, as it is inconsistent with the bible, and destructive to liberty ? Every thinking, honest man rejects it in 
speculation, how few in practice from conscientious motives ! 
</p><p>
Would anyone believe I am the master of slaves of my own purchase ! I am drawn along by the general inconvenience of living here without them. 
I will not, I cannot justify it. However culpable my conduct, I will so far pay my devoir to virtue, as to own the excellence and rectitude of her precepts, 
and lament my want of conformity to them. 
</p><p>
I believe a time will come when an opportunity will be offered to abolish this lamentable evil. Everything we can do is to improve it, if it happens in our day ; if not, let us transmit to our descendants, together with our slaves, a pity for their 
unhappy lot, and an abhorrence of slavery. If we cannot reduce this wished-for reformation to practice, let us treat the unhappy victims with lenity. 
It is the furthest advance we can make toward justice. It is a debt we owe to the purity of our religion, to show that it is at variance with that law which warrants slavery. 
</p><p>
I know not when to stop. I could say many things on the subject, a serious view of which gives a gloomy perspective to future times.
