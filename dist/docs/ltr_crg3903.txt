DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Hearing my friend Ferguson was unwell, I made an elopement to see 
him, and just returned last evening, a little before your express called on 
me, much fatigued, which prevented your favor by him of the 24th. 
I am obliged to you for the paper you sent, and think it would be of 
general information to have it printed ; but Dunlap is so unwell, that 
he has left off printing, and, besides, his paper is so small, and types 
so large, that I am persuaded one of his gazettes could not hold a 
fourth part of it. This would make it far less useful and entertaining 
than if it came out all together. Should any opportunity unexpectedly 
offer of giving it to the public, I will not slip it. The more I consider 
the late intended agreement, the more disgraceful (and that unnecessarily so altogether, in my opinion,) it appears to the State. On the 
Privy Council not being consulted, and yet seeming to be made a party 
thereto, I immediately wrote a letter to his Excellency, to disavow my 
approbation of it; but previous to my sending it, receiving a summons 
to Council, I kept it back till that should be over, expecting the matter 
might be opened there; but finding we were called on a different business, and no probability of its being then touched upon, as I saw, I 
took hold of something that seemed to tend that way, and purposely 
brought it in indirectly in my argument on what was before us, pleading 
as an excuse that as a particle of the executive, by the inaccurate wording of the fourth article, I was brought in as a kind of party to an 
agreement which I almost totally disliked; upon which Mr. E. R., to 
my astonishment, said that the Privy Council was, in no case whatever, 
any part of the executive, which he said was also the opinion of another 
distinguished lawyer he named; and the Governor himself said, that 
old Col. Pinckney, who is conveniently dead, had told him the same. 
This, I think, as well as some other circumstances, leaves great room 
to think, that though the natural Council, appointed by the State, was 
not consulted on that most important occasion, yet that certain lawyers 
at least, if not others, were. This novel and dangerous doctrine, so 
contrary to the spirit of our Constitution and plain letter of many of 
our laws, so roundly and positively asserted, and, although Lowndes 
lieutenant during his administration, and during the greater part of <a href="/results.php?tla=jhr" rel="colleague">J. Rutledge's</a>, I had never heard a title of, or had the least suspicion that 
any such tenet could be advanced, till this morning I heard it declared 
in the strongest terms in Council, and a little before by that gentleman, 
openly in the GOVERNOR'S porch. This induced me, when I went home, 
to add a note, by way of preface, to the letter I had prepared to send 
to his Excellency, a copy of which I now enclose you; the proceeding 
on the cause of it will serve by way of an explanation thereto. We 
have been wanting, my dear sir, more troops for the General all this 
campaign, but, in my opinion, we have wanted still more an efficacious civil power; and, if the enemy leaves Charlestown, which still is a 
doubt with me notwithstanding I cannot help seeing appearances as 
well as others, their advantages over the country, which at this instant 
are so amazingly beyond any they ever had I say, in case of an evacuation, and the sword has a little rest, we must lose no time to join 
shoulder to shoulder to check the rapaciousness, tyranny and insolence 
of too many of our lawyers, or this State will never be at peace, or in 
a respectable situation again, or the citizens thereof upon an equal footing with regard to the possession of their property, which, in my 
opinion, for many years past, the poor and middling people have only 
held rather from courtesy than right, owing principally to that cause. 
Nothing but the infinite number of our laws, and what is quoted as 
authority in our courts (which, without exaggeration, a room of mode 
rate size would not hold) together with the perplexity and confusion, 
give these gentlemen their importance, or, indeed, any importance at 
all. These may be reduced, I am persuaded, to an octavo volume; at 
most, very few of them will ever help, we may be sure. But the 
business is of such necessity, that it must be done, as soon as possible, or we shall, in all probability, be undone; for otherwise their 
insolence as lawyers will be soon equal to what the famous Roman 
Catholic Bishop Becket said to a gentleman he was not well pleased 
with. He told him very haughtily that he hoped to see the day when 
no jack gentleman would dare to stand with his hat on before the lowest 
priest. Without great care this, or something like it, will be soon the 
case with regard to the lawyers here. I never thought there was much 
riddle and finesse necessary in a good Government that honest men 
of good plain common understanding, who would take pains to judge, 
and always judge for themselves, not suffering their understanding to 
be in any man s keeping, were fully equal to the task; but how is the 
case? The people may appoint whom they think proper (as in a Privy 
Council), these may be consulted occasionally to pick the gilding off 
of gingerbread, or some such trifling matter; but in an affair of the 
utmost consequence to the safety, honor and interest of the State, it 
cannot be expected they are fit judges (though, perhaps, a matter not 
even depending on any difficult principle of law); no! without the 
lawyers have the principal hand in it, or, indeed, the whole cooking of 
it, all is undone. I wish this may not have been nearly the case, my 
friend, on a late occasion, which I think almost as disgraceful to the 
State as was the agreement itself. The public are extremely obliged 
to you for your vigilance with regard to the gentlemen sending provisions to town. I believe I cannot be reckoned a severe man in my 
politics ; but I assure you I have done all in my power, for many 
months, to no purpose, to get means used to have some of them tried 
by the sedition laws. If convicted, perhaps my bowels might yearn 
over a poor necessitous man, so as to endeavor to procure his pardon; 
but if a rich fellow, if I had ten thousand votes they should all go for 
a halter for him, and nothing else. Owing to the too great encouragement of these rascals, the army has given over, since the beginning of 
the campaign, to that villainous, destructive trade with the town ; and 
to that impolitic infatuation, from Christmas last, of propagating the 
enemy s hums about an evacuation, we are brought to the present 
dilemma which is, if the enemy actually goes, they even then leave 
us with the highest contempt, and may return; but, should any external 
advantage to them make Sir Guy revoke his orders, what becomes of 
us all then? In that shocking, corrupted state, the people are now in, 
tis heads or tails with us, and the stake, I am afraid, is no less than 
the whole State. Sir Guy is looked upon as aa excellent officer, having 
the good of his nation disinterestedly at heart. No doubt so wary a 
commander must have men here on whom he can depend to give him 
information of our situation in all respects. Pardon me, my dear sir, 
for troubling you with so long a letter, when your time is so important 
to the public. Believe me to be, with sincere esteem, 
Your obedient servant,

P. S. I send to the GOVERNOR'S every day for my rations of beef; 
this moment my boy has returned without any, bringing a note that 
there is none, and that the army is dissatisfied about it. I wish these 
dissatisfactions may not increase daily more and more, and bring on some dangerous crisis. The whole proceeds from the d- d town 
trade, where they live in clover. The same note mentions that the 
Augustine fleet is arrived.
