Dear Sir 
</p><p>
Among the many Congratulatory letters which I have rec'd from different Quarters on the Reduction of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=stoney point" rel="place">Stoney Point</a>, I met with none which 
gave me one half the pleasure I experienced from yours of the 31 st July because I know it to be the effects of friendship, as it's strongly marked 
with that Character, If I have fought with some success the consciousness of having endeavoured to do my duty, added to the Approbation of my friends such 
friends as you is to me a rich reward 
</p><p>
I must now beg your pardon for not acknowledging it sooner but you are to blame yourself for the Omission & give me leave to Insist on 
your Compliance with your promise of visiting the Light Corps it is a debt which of all Others I can never agree to Compound for I therefore 
in the most serious manner call on you for Instant payment. 
</p><p>
Interim believe me with every 
</p><p>
Sentiment of Esteem yours 
</p><p>
Most Sincerely 
</p><p>
