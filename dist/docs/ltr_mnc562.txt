<i>[Biographer's note: tells how both Lees felt about South Carolina's intention to separate from the Union. Mrs. Lee's comment on the unrest of the Arlington slaves resulted from the difficulties Lee encountered when he became executor of his father-in-law's Arlington estate. The situation was seemingly unsolvable; Lee was in charge of emancipating the Arlington slaves, according to the instructions in George Washington Parke Custis' will. However, the will provided that the slaves be freed only after the estate debts were paid. Arlington was deeply in debt when Lee took over as executor, and the only way that the estate could make money was for the slaves to work. When word about the emancipation spread through the slave community, they no longer wanted to work and some slaves ran away. It is difficult to determine to what extent this negative experience with slavery influenced Lee's views.

I only this evening my dear friend received your letter written on the 5th of January. Where could it have been all this time? Not intercepted I hope by the Secessionists. You directed it to Alex[andri]a whereas we have changed our Post Office now to Arlington near Washington DC. I am so much obliged to you for thinking of me in these troubled times, tho I have thought much of you & yours & a few days since had determined to write to you to know if you could approve of all these riotous proceedings. Has all love & pride in their Country died at the South? That they are willing to tear her in pieces & some even to exult to see her glorious flag trailing in the dust. It should rather have drawn tears from their eyes. We have lived & fought & prospered under this flag for so many years & tho the South has suffered much from the meddling of Northern fanatics, yet do they expect to fare better now; are there no rights & privileges but those of negro slavery? You by your situation are removed from any active interference, whereas we in the border states are so much annoyed that our slaves have become almost useless. In our own family we have lost numbers how have been decoyed off, & after my Father?s death we were preserved from an outbreak excited by two abolitionists who were constantly over here (as we learned afterwards, one of whom I am happy to say is now in the penitentiary for 14 years) we were preserved I say by the special mercy of God. The Tribune & New York Times published the most villainous attacks upon my <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="spouse met">husband</a> by name & upon my Father?s memory in language I would not pollute my lips by repeating, & yet after all these wrongs-- would lay down my life could I save our "Union." What is the use of a government combined as ours is of so many parts. The Union of which forms its strength & power if any one part has the right for any wrong real or imaginary of withdrawing its aid &throwing the whole into confusion as Carolina who refuses all overtures for peace & imagines the world will admire her independence, whereas they laugh at her folly, which is perfectly suicidal-- you know my feelings are all linked with the South & you will bear with me in the expression of my opinion, but while there are many of the Northern politicians who deserve no better fate than to be hung as high as Haman, believe me that those who have been foremost in this Revolution will deserve & meet with the reprobation of the world either North or South, for having destroyed the most glorious Confederacy that ever existed. You have lived abroad, you have known many excellent people at the North & all your sympathies & feelings cannot be confined to your state to the exclusion of the country-- The Almighty may intend to punish us for our National pride. I pray now that He will preserve us from Civil War. We can never boast again as a Nation unless all could be restored-- Believe me my dear friend whatever may happen you & yours will be always dear to my heart & at least our love & association will be unbroken. I only wish the other Southern States had left Carolina alone & the government had let her alone & she would now have been tired of her sovereignty. She has been restless & anxious to show her independence for many years & it would have been well for her to try the experiment alone-- Mr. Lee is in Texas deeply grieved at the state of things. Custis is here with us in his absence & goes over daily to his office. He denies to be most kindly remembered to you & all his friends in Savannah. You have yet the advantage of me. I have only one grandson Rooney?s boy called Robert Edward & I haven?t seen him since he was 3 weeks old. Rooney is such a busy farmer he thinks he cannot leave home. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mil" rel="child met">Mildred</a> is at boarding school in Winchester & Rob at the University. I do not know if I have written to you since they both became communicants a subject of great joy to me. Mary Annie & <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=agl" rel="child met">Agnes</a> have been with me all the winter tho Mary is now making a little visit in Washington to her Aunt Mrs. S[idney] S[mith] Lee.
