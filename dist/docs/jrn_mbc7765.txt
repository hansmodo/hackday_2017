<a rel='month origin' value='2'>February</a> <a rel='day origin' value='22'>22d</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=lincolnton' rel='city origin'>LINCOLNTON</a>, N. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. Isabella has been reading my diaries. How we laugh because my sage divinations all come to 
naught. My famous " insight into character " is utter folly. The diaries were lying on the hearth ready to be 
burned, but she told me to hold to them ; think of them a while and don't be rash. Afterward when Isabella and I 
were taking a walk, <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel='met'>General Joseph E. Johnston</a> joined us. He explained to us all of <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>Lee's</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=tjj' rel=''>Stonewall Jackson's</a> 
mistakes. We had nothing to say how could we say any thing? He said he was very angry when he was ordered to 
take command again. He might well have been in a Genuine rage. This on and off procedure would be enough to 
bewilder the coolest head. Mrs. Johnston knows how to be a partizan of <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston</a> and still not make his enemies 
uncomfortable. She can be pleasant and agreeable, as she was to my face.

A letter from my husband who is at Charlotte. He came near being taken a prisoner in Columbia, for he was asleep 
the morning of the 17th, when the Yankees blew up the rail road depot. That woke him, of course, and he found every 
body had left Columbia, and the town was surrendered by the mayor, Colonel Goodwyn. Hampton and his command 
had been gone several hours. Isaac Hayne came away with General Chesnut. There was no fire in the town when they 
left. They overtook Hampton's command at Meek's Mill. That night, from the hills where they encamped, they saw 
the fire, and knew the Yankees were burning the town, as we had every reason to expect they would. Molly was left 
in charge of everything of mine, including Mrs. Preston's cow, which I was keeping, and Sally Goodwyn's furniture.

Charleston and Wilmington have surrendered. I have no further use for a newspaper. I never want to see an 
other one as long as I live. Wade Hampton has been made a lieutenant-general, too late. If he had been made one and 
given command in South Carolina six months ago I believe 
he would have saved us. Shame, disgrace, beggary, all have come at once, and are hard to bear the grand smash ! 
Rain, rain, outside, and naught but drowning floods of tears inside. I could not bear it ; so I rushed down in that rain 
storm to the Martins . Rev. Mr. Martin met me at the door. " Madam," said he, " Columbia is burned to the 
ground." I bowed my head and sobbed aloud. " Stop that ! " he said, trying to speak cheerfully. Come here, 
wife," said he to Mrs. Martin. " This woman cries with her whole heart, just as she laughs." But in spite of his 
words, his voice broke down, and he was hardly calmer than myself.
