DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received duly your favour of March 28th. With this I 
send you two Speeches in Parliament on our Affairs by a 
Member that you know. The Repeal of the whole late Act 
would undoubtedly have been a prudent Measure, and I 
have reason to believe that Lord North was for it, but some 
of the other Ministers could not be brought to agree to it; 
so the Duty on Tea, with that obnoxious Preamble, remains 
to continue the dispute: But I think the next Session will 
hardly pass over without repealing them; for the Parliament must finally comply with the Sense of the Nation. 
</p><p>
As to the Standing Army kept up among us in time of 
Peace, without the Consent of our Assemblies, I am clearly 
of Opinion that it is not agreable to the Constitution. Should 
the King, by the aid of his Parliaments in Ireland and the 
Colonies, raise an Army, and bring it into England, quartering it here in time of Peace without the Consent of the Parliament of Great Britain, I am persuaded he would soon be 
told, that he had no Right so to do, and the Nation would 
ring with Clamours against it. I own, that I see no Difference 
in the Cases: And while we continue so many distinct and 
separate States, our having the same Head, or Sovereign,, 
the King, will not justify such an Invasion of the Separate 
Right of each State to be consulted on the Establishment of 
whatever Force is proposed to be kept up within its Limits, 
and to give or refuse its Consent, as shall appear most for 
the Public Good of that State. 
That the Colonies originally were constituted distinct 
States, and intended to be continued such, is clear to me from 
a thorough Consideration of their original Charters, and the 
whole Conduct of the Crown and Nation towards them until 
the Restoration. Since that Period, the Parliament here has 
usurped an Authority of making Laws for them, which before it had not. We have for some time submitted to that 
Usurpation, partly through Ignorance and Inattention, and 
partly from our Weakness and Inability to contend : I hope, 
when our Rights are better understood here, we shall, by 
prudent and proper Conduct, be able to obtain from the 
Equity of this Nation a Restoration of them. And in the 
mean time, I could wish, that such Expressions as the Supreme Authority of Parliament; the Subordinacy 0} our 
Assemblies to the Parliament, and the like, (which in Reality 
mean nothing, if our Assemblies, with the King, have a true 
Legislative Authority) ; I say, I could wish that such Expressions were no more seen in our publick Pieces. They 
are too strong for Compliment, and tend to confirm a Claim 
of Subjects in one Part of the King's Dominions to be Sovereigns over their Fellow Subjects in another Part of his Dominions, when in truth they have no such Right, and their 
Claim is founded only in Usurpation, the several States 
having equal Rights and Liberties, and being only connected, 
as England and Scotland were before the Union, by having 
one common Sovereign, the King. 
</p><p>
This kind of Doctrine the Lords and Commons here would 
deem little less than Treason against what they think their 
Share of the Sovereignty over the Colonies. To me those 
Bodies seem to have been long encroaching on the Rights 
of their and our Sovereign, assuming too much of his Authority, and betraying his Interests. By our Constitution 
he is, with his plantation Parliaments, the sole Legislator of 
his American Subjects, and in that Capacity is, and ought 
to be, free to exercise his own Judgment, unrestrained and 
unlimited by his Parliament here. And our Parliaments 
have right to grant him Aids without the Consent of this 
Parliament, a Circumstance, which, by the way, begins to 
give it some Jealousy. Let us, therefore, hold fast our 
Loyalty to our King, who has the best Disposition towards 
us, and has a Family Interest in our Prosperity; as that 
steady Loyalty is the most probable means of securing us 
from the arbitrary Power of a corrupt Parliament, that does 
not like us, and conceives itself to have an Interest in keeping 
us down and fleecing us. 
</p><p>
If they should urge the inconvenience of an empire's being 
divided into so many separate States, and from thence conclude, that we are not so divided, I would answer, that an 
Inconvenience proves nothing but itself. England and 
Scotland were once separate States, under the same King. 
The Inconvenience found in their being separate States did 
not prove, that the Parliament of England had a right to 
govern Scotland. A formal Union was thought necessary, 
and England was a hundred Years soliciting it, before she 
could bring it about. If Great Britain now think such a 
Union necessary with us, let her propose her Terms, and we 
may consider them. Were the general Sentiments of this 
Nation to be consulted in the Case, I should hope the Terms, 
whether practicable or not, would at least be equitable ; for 
I think, that, except among those with whom the spirit of 
Toryism prevails, the popular Inclination here is, to wish 
us well, and that we may preserve our Liberties. 
I unbosom myself thus to you, in Confidence of your 
Prudence, and wishing to have your Sentiments on the Subject in return. 
</p><p>
Mr. Pownall, I suppose, will acquaint you with the Event 
of his Motions, and therefore I say nothing more of them, 
than that he appears very sincere in his Endeavours to serve 
us; on which Account, I some time since republished with 
Pleasure the parting Addresses to him of your Assembly, 
with some previous Remarks to his Honour, as well as in 
Justification of our People. 
</p><p>
I hope, that before this time those detestable Murderers 
have quitted your Province, and that the Spirit of Industry 
and Frugality continues and increases. With sincerest 
Esteem and Affection, I am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient & most humble servant 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

P. S. Just before the last Session of Parliament commenced, a Friend of mine, who had Connection with some 
of the Ministry, wrote me a Letter purposely to draw from 
me my Sentiments in writing on the then State of Affairs. I 
wrote a pretty free Answer which I know was immediately 
communicated, and a good deal handed about among them. 
For your private Amusement I send you Copies. I wish 
you may be able to read them, as they are very badly written 
by a blundering clerk.
