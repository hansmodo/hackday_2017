Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I received last evening the two letters you did me the 
honour to write on the 8th February last, and congratulate 
you sincerely on the birth of your grandson. 
</p><p>
I have accepted the office which Congress was pleased 
to offer me, and shall be much obliged to vou for such intelligence from time to time as you may think useful for me 
to receive, and prudent for you to communicate. As a 
public man, I shall always remember your attachment and 
services to the United States ; and as a private one, it will 
always give me pleasure to acknowledge the friendly attention which has so long marked your conduct towards me 
and my family. In both capacities, therefore, I shall be 
happy to give you better evidence of my esteem and 
regard, than compliments or professions can possibly 
afford.

<a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Morris</a>'s resignation is a great loss to this country, 
and yet I am not without hopes that the department of 
finance will become properly arranged. The nature of our 
governments, as well as the circumstance of their being 
new, exposes our operations to delay, and renders the best 
systems slow in forming, as well as slow in executing. In 
my opinion, one superintendent or commissioner of the 
treasury is preferable to any greater number of them ; 
indeed, I would rather have each department under the 
direction of one able man, than of twenty able ones. All 
things, however, in this world, have their bright as well as 
their dark sides ; and there are few systems so imperfect 
as not to have some conveniences. Many reasons induce 
me to disapprove of committing the treasury to the management of three persons ; and yet one very great convenience 
results from it, viz., that our jealous republicans will have 
more confidence in three gentlemen coming from different 
parts of the continent, than they would place in any one 
single man. Confidence, you know, is always followed by 
credit, and credit is the forerunner of money. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
