My Dear Brother: I supposed when <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> fell 
that you would have a period of rest, and perhaps might 
return to Ohio to find yourself popular and famous. But 
the fortune of war carries you into new dangers and I 
hope new successes. We have been very anxious for 
news from your movements, but as yet we have only had 
uncertain reports, and can only live in the hope that you 
will whip Johnston and win new laurels. I have just 
returned from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>, where I was during the whole 
of Morgan's raid. How completely the tone of the press 
has changed in regard to you. Even the "Gazette," 
which has been malignant to the last degree, published 
quite a number of letters in which your share of the 
movements about <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> was highly praised. I 
notice, however, that the editor has said nothing. All 
other papers, and indeed all officers and citizens with 
whom I converse, gave you great credit. So that now 
in the Northern States, and especially here in Ohio, 
your popularity is second only to that of Grant. You 
need care but little for this, as you passed through a 
storm of obloquy which would have submerged many an 
officer. Popular opinion is so changeable that it is 
worthless. It is founded upon rumor, and is as explosive as gas. 'Meade has had a foretaste of this. His 
drawn battle at Gettysburg relieved the country from a 
great danger, and he was at once a hero; he was the 
coming man. He has allowed <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel rel="">Lee</a> to escape him, and 
all his popular honors are lost.. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gbm" rel="colleague met">McClellan</a> has succeeded 
in establishing the position of a party leader, and now 
enjoys the bad honor of being cheered by a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> mob 
of thieves and scoundrels, while poor Hooker is dropped 
by all just when he thought he had <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel rel="">Lee</a> in his power. 
</p><p>
While the war goes on there is a danger looming up 
that seems to me more ominous than any other. It is 
the Presidential election next summer. We shall have a 
fierce canvass. ... If the election cannot be held in the 
Southern States, no one is likely to get a majority of the 
electoral college. This must be, to secure an election 
by the people. All the States must be counted, and 
under the Constitution the successful candidate must 
have a majority of all the electoral votes. Can this be 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a> " Gazette." secured by any one man? If not, the election then goes 
into the House, and who can tell the result. The war 
has done a great deal to shake that implicit obedience to 
law which has been the great conservative element, but 
in the struggle for so vast a prize will it not be easy to 
clog the machinery for a legal election ? and then civil 
war or anarchy is the certain result. These are only 
possible dangers, but it is well to look them in the face. 
At present I do not stand very well with my political 
associates, because I have openly differed with them on 
important questions. But I am too well grounded in 
the principles of the Eepublican party to be shaken in 
my faith. Indeed, nearly all the errors into which the 
administration has fallen, have arisen from the advice of 
an old school of politicians who never belonged to the 
Eepublican party.

Affectionately your brother,
