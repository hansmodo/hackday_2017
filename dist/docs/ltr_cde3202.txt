SIR, 
</p><p>
The bar of the River Shrewsbury, the officer, sailors, 
and boats that I have lost in the waves, have not 
hindered <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Laurens</a> from braving them twice, 
to come and deliver me himself the letter that you 
did me the honor to write me on the 14th of this month. The desire of communicating with you alone would have induced me to hard a descent myself 
the first, and with four grenadiers as my only sup 
port, in a place, the debarkation of which is as difficult as it was unknown ; and where there existed not a single spot proper for embarkation. The sacrifice 
of several of my men appeared to me less affecting, 
as it was the sole means of communication I could 
have. 
</p><p>
I have occupied myself less with discovering the 
number of English vessels of war in the Road of 
Sandy Hook, than the means of entering it. I sup 
pose there are fourteen vessels of war, a throng of frigates, and a multitude of transports. This superiority 
of number, and the goodness of the English navy, 
will not hinder me from attacking Lord Howe in his 
retrenchment, and under his batteries, if the depth of 
the water do not forbid me. I only received three pilots yesterday ; they have need of re-collecting their 
ideas, and are at this time sounding the river. The 
hope of giving you something positive on this head 
engaged me to pray your estimable, well-informed, 
and most amiable Aid-de-camp, to pass a bad night 
on board the Languedoc. 
</p><p>
He will give you an account, Sir, of the regret I 
shall feel, if this powerful mark of friendship, which 
the King has given his allies, who are so dear to 
him, should not prove of so great utility as he might 
promise himself. 
</p><p>
I will not enter into any further detail in this letter. <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Laurens</a> will tell you more than I can 
write. But it will be very important that the arrival of so great a naval succour should produce at 
the same time a general effort by land. If, unfortunately, that should be impossible, you are too good a 
patriot and too good a soldier not to feel the necessity I shall be under of going to seek elsewhere an 
opportunity of injuring our common enemy. The 
places that you shall point out to me will appear to 
me preferable, whenever naval circumstances and the 
state of my supplies will permit. It is with the 
greatest pleasure that I learn, from M. Gerard, the 
King's Minister, that you are clothed with the most 
ample powers to treat with me on military operations. I cannot act, either far or near, under the auspices of a greater master. You are a master; and 
you know that, the instant one thing becomes , we ought to attempt another. 
</p><p>
I have received a printed list of the eleven English vessels of the line, which are announced to us on 
very good part. This news, published by the order 
of Congress, acquires an authenticity which merits the 
highest attention. 
</p><p>
Accept my compliments upon your last victory. 
Even were not the success of America our own, by 
the intimate bands which bind us together, it would 
be impossible, as a soldier and as a man, not to participate in it. It is natural to love to see one laurel 
more adorning the brow of a great man. I have the 
honor to be, with respect, 
</p><p>
Your very humble, and very obedient servant,
