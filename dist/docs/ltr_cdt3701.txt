Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received the letter, which your Excellency 
has done me the honor to write, the 6th of this 
month, on the subject of the American frigates which 
may join the squadron of the King of France. 
</p><p>
When I shall be equal in force to the enemy, or 
perhaps superior, and when there shall be any maritime operation corresponding with that which you 
have premeditated, and which Monsieur the Marquis 
de Lafayette has imparted to me, those frigates will 
certainly be very useful to me ; but, till then, I think 
they might be employed most usefully in a cruise 
to intercept the vessels which go from <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> to 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I believe that Admiral Arbuthnot has, 
in this place here, all his strong frigates. 
</p><p>
I propose to your Excellency to have escorted, by 
those frigates, to the ports of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, a vessel loaded 
with flour by Monsieur Holker for the squadron of 
the King of France, and which is at present in the 
Delaware. It would be necessary, in this case, that 
they take their route a little large, that they may 
not fall too near this place, the frigates of Arhuthnotbeins: able to extend their cruises to the Shoals of 
Nantucket. This Admiral sent me, yesterday morning, a [flag], in order to transmit me some letters 
from French prisoners, at this very moment at New 
York. He is anchored at the easternmost point of 
Long Island. I had sent a vessel, some hours before, 
to propose to him an exchange. 
</p><p>
If you do not want the sloop <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, and this 
vessel is a good sailer, your Excellency could despatch her to St. Domingo. The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> would send, by this opportunity, the letter which 
I had transmitted to him for the Count de Guichen, 
and which ought to be translated into ciphers by 
the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague'>Chevalier De La Luzerne</a>. I require, conformably 
to the orders of the King, a reenforcement of some 
ships from this French Commander. If these arrive 
by the end of September, I could transport your 
army to Long Island the beginning of October, and 
finally decide the fate of America this year. I send 
to the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague'>Chevalier De La Luzerne</a> the signals of recognizance which have been previously addressed to me 
by the Council of Admiralty at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and which I 
have adopted. It is necessary that there should be 
uniformity in those on the whole coast, to avoid confusion. I am, with respect and sincere attachment. 
Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most humble and most obedient servant.
