Sir: Since my No. 50, of the 31st May, I have, upon more mature reflection, come to the conclusion that your instructions of the 24th June last, and every subsequent order, will not 
justify my taking possession of any part of California, or any hostile measure against Mexico (notwithstanding their attack upon our troops), as neither party have declared war. I shall, 
therefore, in conformity with those instructions, be careful to avoid any act of aggression until I [am] certain one or the other party have done so, or until I find that our squadron in the 
Gulf have commenced offensive operations, presuming that, as they are in daily communication with the Department, their proceedings are authorized. 
</p><p>
The want of communication with, and information from, the Department and our consul, render my situation anything but pleasant; indeed it is humiliating and mortifying in the 
extreme, as by my orders I cannot act, while it appears to the world that we are actually at war on the other coast. 
</p><p>
Three of the sloops are on the coast of California, where I shall proceed, leaving the Warren here to bring intelligence. The Shark is at Columbia River. 
</p><p>
Most respectfully, I am your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jds" rel="me">J. D. Sloat</a>, Commodore. 
</p><p>
To the Honorable Secretary of the Navy, Washington. 
</p><p>
Navy Department, January 11, 1848. 
The foregoing is a translation of a letter received at this Department in cipher. 
</p><p>
J. Y. Mason.
