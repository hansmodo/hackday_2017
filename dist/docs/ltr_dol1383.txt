I wrote you that the Embargo would take place three or four days before it did, 
dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="sibling met">Anna</a>. General Dearborn will leave this in a few days. I went to Mrs. Eustis s 
last Sunday evening with Mr. and Mrs. M. only two or three ladies present. Foster, Serurier, General Dearborn, Mr. Brent, 
and one or two other men, but dull. Mrs. Hamilton and Mrs. Eustis have had parties no one else. Congress will not adjourn, I believe, though it has been much 
spoken of ; the intention is on the decline now, from an idea that it will make a bad 
impression, both in and out of our country. So now, my dear sister, it seems May will 
smile on your journey to us ; tell me when and how you begin it. I received a letter 
by ship from Mrs. Barlow, which I will send you. She says the Hornet will sail in a few days, and will bring us a treaty of 
commerce, et cetera. Every prospect is fair in that quarter.
