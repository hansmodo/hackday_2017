DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter of the 10th instant, ad 
dressed to Lieutenant-Governor Cortlandt, was delivered to me yesterday evening, and I immediately for 
warded, by express, your letter to Brigadier-General 
James Clinton, and urged him to the utmost expedition in his march to <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>. I inclose your Excellency a copy of a letter from my brother, of 
the 10th instant, giving the particular disposition of 
the regiments of his brigade, by which it appears, 
that Colonel Gansevoort's was employed in escorting a supply of provisions to Fort Schuyler. As this appeared to me to be a business of too much importance to admit of delay, or be intrusted to the care 
of a weak party, I have therefore taken the liberty 
of advising him to continue this regiment on that 
service until it shall be accomplished, which, I hope, 
will meet your Excellency's approbation. 
</p><p>
I am apprehensive that the other three regiments 
(they having, previous to the receipt of your Excellency's order, marched to the respective stations mentioned in my brother's letter) will not be able to 
reach <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a> on as early a day as might have 
been expected. The militia, in the vicinity of the 
posts in the Highlands, were, before I left <a href='/results.php?city=poughkeepsie' rel='city'>Poughkeepsie</a>, put under orders to hold themselves in constant readiness to take the field on the shortest notice ; and, on the signals of alarm being given, those 
on the west side of the river are to repair to West 
Point, and those on the east side are to rendezvous 
at <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>, and there wait for further orders. Of this 
I apprised General Howe at the time. I now write 
to him on the subject; and, if it should be thought 
necessary by your Excellency, I will immediately 
order such part of them to <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a> as your Excellency or General Howe may direct, until the arrival of <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel=''>General Clinton</a>'s brigade. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's several letters of the 23d and 
28th ultimo, and 2d instant, were received and opened by Lieutenant-Governor Cortlandt, in my absence, 
and such of them as were proper to be communicated to the Legislature, with the letters from the 
Committee of Congress, of the 25th ultimo, were laid 
before them; and I am happy in being able to as 
sure your Excellency, that they give me reason to 
hope that they will yield a compliance with the requisitions made of this State, on this important occa 
sion, except in the article of forage, of which this 
State is entirely exhausted. 
</p><p>
The moment I closed my last letter to General 
Schuyler, which has been communicated to your Excellency, I embarked for <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, with an intention 
to intercept the enemy, under Sir John Johnson, in 
their retreat from Tryon county, or to succour Fort 
Schuyler, if invested, which I then apprehended might 
have been the case. On my arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, I soon 
had reason to believe that the report of a force having marched against that post was merely calculated 
to favor Sir John Johnson's incursion ; and, as the 
militia had collected, he had retired about six miles 
from Johnstown, and was preparing to return to Canada by a route more northward than that by which 
he entered the country. I therefore directed Colonel 
Van Schaick, who was at Fort Hunter, to march for 
ward and hang close upon and harass his rear, to 
afford time for me to gain his front with the militia, 
to the north of <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, which I expected to be able 
to effect, by striking into Jessup's Patent from Fort Edward. But, before my letter reached Colonel Van Schaick, the militia in that quarter, being out of 
provisions, and finding Sir John retiring, were returning home, which was also the case with those who 
assembled, and I expected to find at <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a>. 
</p><p>
Under these circumstances, I found it necessary to 
alter my plan, to that of passing Lake George, and 
meeting the enemy on the borders of Lake Champlain, which (as the enemy appeared to be much 
fatigued by their long march, and it was to be presumed would move slow as soon as they were advanced such a distance as to conceive themselves out 
of danger) I conceived might still be practicable. I 
accordingly reassembled the militia, and, with the 
levies stationed at <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a>, and a detachment of 
Warner's regiment, crossed Lake George. But, though 
I had a force, superior to that of the enemy, advanced as far as Bulwagger's Bay, below Crown Point, 
the place at which the enemy embarked, within eight 
days after my leaving this place, I was so unfortunate as to find (judging by the information of our scouts, and by the appearance of the bushes and 
bark the enemy had prepared to hut themselves, but 
did not put up, and by other marks as well as the 
sailing of their vessels) we were about six hours too 
late. 
</p><p>
I would fain hope, however, that the attempt, though 
unsuccessful, may be attended with the good effect 
of deterring the enemy from a similar enterprise, as 
it will, at least, discover to them the danger which 
may attend it. I think it my duty to inform your Excellency that, on my request, I was joined by a 
party of two hundred and forty of the militia of the 
Grants, under Colonel Warner and Major Allen, whose 
behaviour on this occasion, in every respect, was very 
agreeable to me. I beg your Excellency will pardon me in troubling you with this long detail, as I 
wish it only to be received as an apology for not 
succeeding in an attempt which I gave you reason to 
believe was practicable, and which undoubtedly might 
have been effected had I found matters in the train 
I had reason to expect. I have the honor to be, 
with the greatest respect and esteem, dear Sir, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
