Dear Brother : Now that the Convention at Chicago 
has nominated Elaine and Logan, I feel such a sense of 
relief that I would approve of anything. My instructions to Henderson, verbal, telegraphic, and written, 
were all short, emphatic, and clear, and, so far as I am 
concerned, all may be published; viz. first, to do what 
was possible to prevent even the mention of my name ; 
and, second, that though there should occur a break after 
the first ballots, and my name should be presented as a 
compromise, to decline ; and, lastly, if in spite of such 
declination I should be nominated, I would decline with 
an emphasis which might be construed as disrespectful 
to the Convention itself, which, of course, I do not want 
to do. 
</p><p>
I would not for a million of dollars subject myself 
and family to the ordeal of a political canvass and afterwards to a four years' service in the White House. You 
and Elaine and others have been trained in a different 
school, quite different, and have a perfect right to 
aim for the highest round of your ladder. . . . Here 
at this point I must confide to you, in absolute confidence, that I was in possession of a letter from Elaine, 
all in his own hand, marked " Strictly, absolutely confidential," which I now possess, with a copy of my 
answer, with others from various people, all to the same 
effect , that in case of a break and deadlock between 
Elaine and Arthur it was inevitable that my name would 
be used, and that I had no more right to decline than if 
I had received an order as lieutenant of the army. When 
you come here sometime I will show you these letters, 
but I must not part with them. I had expected that my 
letters in answer, in case of a break which all seemed 
to expect would compel the Convention to turn to you, 
Edmunds, Hawley, or Gresham, and it may be that my 
positive manner carried conviction of my sincerity and 
stubbornness, and helped to bring about the nomination 
of Elaine and Logan. Anyhow, I escaped, and that to 
me was salvation. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours,
