DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I just now received your favor of yesterday's date. By a 
scout, who has been near <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a>, and from one of the 
inhabitants in that neighbourhood, I have a confirmation of the 
enemy's movements mentioned in your letter. I think it is not 
probable that their design is on your post. However, I will keep 
the most watchful eye over them, and, if possible, prevent a surprise. 
</p><p>
On being informed by almost every person who came in, as 
well as by the letter you inclosed to me from General Palmer, 
of the weak state of <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and also advised that a considerable number of our men were prisoners in the enemy's hands,, 
and kept at Lake George Landing, under a very small guard, at 
which place the enemy had a large magazine of stores ; and sup 
posing a movement that way would perfectly coincide with the 
original design of my being" sent here, namely, if possible to di 
vide and distract the enemy, I was induced yesterday, with the 
advice of the officers, to send Colonel Brown, with five hundred 
men, to the landing at Lake George, to relieve the prisoners and 
destroy the stores there ; the same number of men under Colonel 
Johnson to Mount Independence; the latter to give a diversion 
to the enemy, while the former should execute his commission, 
and, if an opportunity should offer, without risking too much, to 
push for Mount Independence, while Colonel Brown would at 
tempt <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and, farther, to amuse and divide the enemy 
by attacking their outposts, &c. A like number of men were 
sent under Colonel Woodbridge to Skenesborough, thence to Fort 
Anne, and on to <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a>. 
</p><p>
I hope these movements will meet your approbation. I should 
have mentioned the design before, and not have put the plan in 
execution without your advice, could I have been sure the in 
formation would not have fallen into the hands of the enemy. I 
supposed that you intended to hint to me your apprehension of 
danger in this way, and that I must be cautious as to what I 
wrote, when, in the close of your favor of the 10th, you say, " I 
desire you will not fail frequently to acquaint me with your movements, and, as far as is prudent, with your designs." 
I am, &c.,
