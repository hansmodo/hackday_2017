We arrived in Panama Harbor about 2 o'clock Sunday night, and landed next morning in small boats, paying two dollars for self and baggage. Immediately on landing, I went to the Echo office in quest of my old friend and fellow apprentice, Fred E. Foster. I found him in the street, took breakfast with him, and had a very pleasant time.

Panama is a much larger and better built place than I anticipated. The houses are all very strongly built of stone and adobe, and many of them are two and three stories high. The streets are well paved, and considerable trade is transacted. There are a good many American stores and hotels.

I hired a handsome little horse, for $21, to cross the Isthmus. After one of the hardest rides I ever took, over the worst roads, we arrived at Cruces, 25 miles distant, and put up at the American Hotel. During the time of crossing, it rained about half the time, it being the rainy season, and the road at places was exceedingly rough and muddy. Many an unlucky rider was tumbled over his animal's head and the animals of many others gave out long before they reached Cruces. I was exceedingly lucky, only dismounting once, and my horse did not fall a single time. I carried a carpetbag with me, but would not do so again, as a man has quite enough to take care of himself. A few women crossed over with us and we met a few going toward Panama. They were, of course, all much
fatigued and worn out. Children were carried across by the natives. The ladies were dressed in pantaloons and strode their animals.

The road is over very high hills and down steep gullies. The cuts are often twenty feet deep through the rock and so narrow that animals cannot pass each other. A part of the road has been well paved at one time but it is now in ruins, which often makes it worse than had it never been paved at all. I saw very little fruit growing.

Cruces, on the north bank of the Chagres River, is built almost entirely of straight poles set upright and covered with plantain and palm leaves. It has a population of about 2,000. Here we overtook many of the Golden Gate passengers who had arrived in Panama a day sooner than ourselves.

After an hour's ride down the river next morning, we arrived at Barbacoas, which is the present terminus of the railroad. There is one hotel in Barbacoas, at which some of our passengers took dinner. At 3 1/2 o'clock the cars started for Aspinwall, 22 miles distant, fare $8. There were two trains and the cars were well finished. The distance is usually accomplished in two hours, but in our case the foremost train ran off the track, broke one of the cars, and detained us about three hours. Fortunately no one was harmed. The road passed over a comparatively level country and runs on the river bank at places. We passed heavy mahogany timber and luxuriant vegetation. It was raining and quite dark when we arrived at Aspinwall, and we had some difficulty in finding hotels for lodging. At length we groped our way to the Ocean House, where we had a tolerably decent supper, a first-rate iced lemonade, and a good cot to sleep on.

This morning we went to the steamship office and found that all the cabin tickets were taken at $64 and $80, and as nothing better could be obtained, we had to take steerage passage in the United States at $40. At 9 o'clock the steamship El Dorado of the mail line left her wharf, full of passengers for New Orleans.

Aspinwall is a place of only a few months' growth, is built on a marshy spot, and consists of two wharves, the railroad station, and a few stores and hotels, the latter principally kept by Americans.
