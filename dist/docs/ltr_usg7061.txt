You need not attempt the raid with the cavalry you now have. If that in Kentucky can recruit up it may do hereafter to 
send it on such an expedition. I have asked so often for a cooperative movement from the troops in West Virginia that I 
hardly expect to see anything to help us from there. <a href='/results.php?tla=hwh' rel='co-worker met'>General Halleck</a> says they have not got men enough. Crook, however, 
has gone there, and may undertake to strike the road about New River.

U. S. GRANT,

Major- General.
