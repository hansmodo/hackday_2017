<a rel='month origin' value='6'>June</a> <a rel='day origin' value='3'>3d</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. Doctor John Cheves is making infernal ma chines in Charleston to blow the Yankees up ; pretty name 
they have, those machines. My horses, the overseer says, are too poor to send over. There was corn enough on the 
place for two years, they said, in January; now, in June, they write that it will not last until the new crop comes in. 
Somebody is having a good time on the plantation, if it be not my poor horses.

Molly will tell me all when she comes back, and more. Mr. Venable has been made an aide to <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>General Robert E. Lee</a>. He is at Vicksburg, and writes, " When the fight is over here, I shall be glad to go to Virginia. " He is in capital spirits. I notice army men all are when they write. 
</p><p>
Apropos of calling Major Venable " Mr." Let it be noted that in social intercourse we are not prone to give 
handles to the names of those we know well and of our nearest and dearest. A general's wife thinks it bad form 
to call her husband anything but " Mr." When she gives him his title, she simply " drops " into it by accident. If 
I am mixed on titles in this diary, let no one blame me.

Telegrams come from Richmond ordering troops from Charleston. Can not be sent, for the Yankees are attacking 
Charleston, doubtless with the purpose to prevent <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>Lee's</a> receiving reenforcements from there.

Sat down at my window in the beautiful moonlight, and tried hard for pleasant thoughts. A man began to play on 
the flute, with piano accompaniment, first, " Ever of thee I am fondly dreaming, and then, The long, long, weary 
day. At first, I found this but a complement to the beautiful scene, and it was soothing to my wrought-up nerves. 
But Von Weber's "Last Waltz" was too much; I broke down. Heavens, what a bitter cry came forth, with such 
floods of tears ! the wonder is there was any of me left.

I learn that Richmond women go in their carriages for the wounded, carry them home and nurse them. One saw 
a man too weak to hold his musket. She took it from him, put it on her shoulder, and helped the poor fellow along.

If ever there was a man who could control every expression of emotion, who could play stoic, or an Indian chief, 
it is James Chesnut. But one day when he came in from the Council he had to own to a break-down. He was awfully ashamed of his weakness. There was a letter from Mrs. Gaillard asking him to help her, and he tried to read it to 
the Council. She wanted a permit to go on to her son, who 
lies wounded in Virginia. Colonel Chesnut could not control his voice. There was not a dry eye there, when suddenly one man called out, God bless the woman.

Johnston Pettigrew's aide says he left his chief mortally 
wounded on the battle-field. Just before Johnston Pettigrew went to Italy to take a hand in the war there for 
freedom, I met him one day at Mrs. Frank Hampton's. A number of people were present. Some one spoke of the 
engagement of the beautiful Miss to Hugh Rose. Some one else asked: " How do you know they are engaged? " 
"Well, I never heard it, but I saw it. In London, a month or so ago, I entered Mrs.'s drawing-room, and I saw 
these two young people seated on a sofa opposite the door. " Well, that amounted to nothing." " No, not in itself. 
But they looked so foolish and so happy. I have noticed newly engaged people always look that way." And so on. 
Johnston Pettigrew was white and red in quick succession during this turn of the conversation ; he was in a rage of 
indignation and disgust. i I think this kind of talk is taking a liberty with the young lady's name," he exclaimed 
finally, " and that it is an impertinence in us." I fancy him left dying alone ! I wonder what they feel those who 
are left to die of their wounds alone on the battle-field.

Free schools are not everything, as witness this spelling. Yankee epistles found in camp show how illiterate they can 
be, with all their boasted schools. Fredericksburg is spelled " Fredrexbirg, " medicine, " metison," and we read, " To 
my sweat brother," etc. For the first time in my life no books can interest me. Life is so real, so utterly earnest, 
that fiction is flat. Nothing but what is going on in this distracted world of ours can arrest my attention for ten minutes at a time.
