Early yesterday while I was digging a hole to put the beef head in, Mrs. Cox told me that the express had come in the night before. This was glowing intelligence to me for I had wished and expected to hear from home. I immediately proceeded to the office and found one letter from Miss Emma Hunter and although I had hoped to receive something from some others, I was satisfied with this. I paid $2.40 for this letter and was very glad to get it. Papers, the express could not obtain, or rather, if they did, they could not make a trip more than once in three months. The forenoon I devoted to search of gold but the high water drove me out and I employed the afternoon in writing to Miss Hunter. I prevailed upon Atkins to consult a physician and he gave him some medicine.
