SIR, 
</p><p>
The inclosed resolves, which I have the honor of 
transmitting, call for your immediate attention ; and I 
am to request you will take measures in pursuance 
thereof, as soon as possible. <a href='/results.php?tla=chl' rel='colleague'>General Lee's</a> situation 
seems to be extremely dangerous and critical, and 
from General Howe's behaviour to him, it is highly 
probable he will be brought to a trial for desertion. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=chl' rel='colleague'>General Lee</a>, it is said by Mr. Eustace, his Aid-de camp, having addressed two letters to General Howe, 
received them both back again, unopened, and inclosed under a cover directed to <a href='/results.php?tla=chl' rel='colleague'>Lieutenant- Colonel Lee</a>. 
I hope the flag, which Congress ordered to be sent 
to make inquiry into the manner in which he was 
treated, has been despatched, and a remonstrance, in 
consequence of it, should the information you have 
received of his treatment have rendered that step 
necessary. 
</p><p>
You will please to propose an exchange of the six 
Hessian field-officers for him; and at the same time 
make inquiry whether the report which Congress have 
heard of Mrs. Stockton's being confined in a common 
jail by the enemy, has any truth in it or not. 
</p><p>
By a letter, which Congress yesterday received from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a>, we are informed that <a href='/results.php?tla=jhc' rel='colleague'>General Cadwalader</a>, 
with the troops under him, had joined your army; 
that the enemy were at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>; that the two armies 
were divided only by a creek; and that a general 
engagement was hourly expected. In the mean time 
Congress are infinitely anxious to hear the event, 
and humbly hope that victory has declared in favor of those whose sacred cause should inspire them with 
ardor, on every solemn appeal to that Being who 
hateth all injustice, tyranny, and oppression. I have 
the honor to be, with every sentiment of respect, Sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President. 
</p><p>
P. S. If the desire of Congress to procure <a href='/results.php?tla=chl' rel='colleague'>General Lee's</a> exchange cannot be effected, and the enemy, 
preferring the gratification of revenge to the civility 
they owe their Hessian auxiliaries, determine to keep 
or to abuse him, it will be very agreeable to Congress 
that their determination, with the inclosed resolve, be 
made known to the Hessians as fully as possible. 
To secure General Lee as effectually as may be from 
personal insult and injury, Congress have come to the 
present resolution; which you, Sir, are desired to convey to General Howe, with all convenient despatch. 
It will be very agreeable to Congress, that the Hessian field-officer intended to be exchanged for Colonel Ethan Allen, be sent to notify it to General Howe, 
taking his parole to return in a fixed time, if Colonel 
Allen is not returned in his place. It will fall with 
in the wish of Congress, if Colonel Rahl, or one of 
the Hessian officers, should be also sent with the flag 
proposing the exchange of General Lee ; but the propriety of it is submitted to you. 
</p><p>
We have had an imperfect account of the engagement at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, and anxiously wait for further particulars. It was in hopes of receiving them that I 
detained the express till this morning.
