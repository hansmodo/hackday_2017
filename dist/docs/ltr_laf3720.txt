My dear General, 
</p><p>
Great happiness is derived from friendship ; and I 
do particularly experience it in the attachment "which 
unites me to you. But friendship has its duties, and 
the man that likes you the best will be the forwardest in letting you know every thing where you can 
be concerned. 
</p><p>
When the enemy came to your house, many negroes deserted to them. This piece of news did not 
affect me much, as I little value those concerns. But 
you cannot conceive how unhappy I have been, to 
hear that Mr. Lund Washington went on board the 
enemy's vessels, and consented to give them provisions. This being done by the gentleman who, in 
some measure, represents you at your house, will certainly have a bad effect, and contrasts with spirited 
answers from some neighbours, that had their houses 
burnt accordingly. You will do what you think proper about it, my dear General; but, as your friend, 
it was my duty confidentially to mention the circumstances. 
</p><p>
With the help of some wagons and horses, we got 
in two days from the camp, near <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, to this 
place. We halted yesterday, and having made a 
small bargain for a few shoes, are marching to <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>. No official account from Phillips. But 
I am told they are removing stores from <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> 
and Petersburg. I am surprised nobody writes to 
me ; and hope soon to receive intelligence. 
</p><p>
Our men are in high spirits. Their honor having 
been interested in this affair, they have made it a 
point to come with us; and discontents, as well as 
desertion, are entirely out of fashion. Requesting my 
best respects to be presented to Mrs. Washington, 
and compliments to the family, I have the honor 
to be, with those sentiments which you know, my 
dear General, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant and friend, 
</p><p>

P. S. The Chevalier writes me, that <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count De Rochambeau</a> is going to join you, so that both armies 
will cooperate, I had rather remain in Virginia than go to Carolina. This I mention, because orders are 
to come from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>. But, if the detachment is to go more southerly, I will go there as fast as I can.
