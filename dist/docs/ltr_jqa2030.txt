DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
You will doubtless hear before this reaches you the event of a town meeting which was called here lately for the purpose of helping forward <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="colleague">Mr. Madison's</a> resolutions, and of 
intimidating our representatives who opposed them. After 
great [exertions] had been made to raise a Committee 
ready for everything, [and the] Committee had reported a 
number of resolves to answer [their purp]oses, a very decided 
majority of a crowded town meeting voted to adjourn with 
out day, and did not even hear a discussion of the resolves. 
The lurking serpent was perceived and avoided. The commercial part of the town were almost unanimous, and the 
aversion to any measures which might be productive of war 
appeared very decidedly to be the prevailing sentiment with 
the citizens of every description. The Jacobins were completely discomfited, and will have the mortification to find 
their intended poison operate as an invigorating cordial. 
</p><p>
The arrival of the new Minister from France and recall of 
Genet is another circumstance of mortification to the same 
party. They are not yet sure that Mr. Fauchet will imitate 
his predecessor by connecting himself and his country with a 
desperate faction intent upon the ruin of our own government ; 
and while that remains an uncertainty, they feel extremely 
fearful of losing their main support. I hope however that 
the new plenipotentiary will pursue a different system, and 
that we shall still be permitted to remain at peace. 
</p><p>
Our Supreme Court has been sitting about a fortnight. 
Without being overburdened with business I have on my 
hands sufficient to employ almost all my time, and to keep upon my mind a continual anxiety which unfits me for any 
thing else. This will be my excuse for having so long neglected to write you. 
</p><p>
Since the contest between Americanus and Barneveld, the 
reputed author of the former has treated me with an unusual degree of civility. He has even in one or two causes 
of considerable consequence advised his clients to engage 
me. I know the man, and shall have as little dependance 
upon his kindness as I have fear of his resentment. I know 
he will never injure me while I keep myself out of the reach 
of his malice. . . .
