I embrace the first opportunity since my arrival here to 
write you. I am very happy in the General's family. His 
secretaries and aides-de-camp are gentlemen of education, 
and of the most polite, obliging manners. Yesterday General Howe's army decamped, and, from the best accounts, 
are all retired to Amboy, from whence the passage to Staten 
Island is short and easy. What will be their next attempt 
is altogether uncertain ; but I am inclined to think the game 
is nearly over with them. I believe as many as thirty 
deserters from the enemy have come in since my arrival 
here, which was on Tuesday, the 17th inst.

In the execution of my office, I have received all necessary assistance from Colonel Connor, the late temporary 
Adjutant-General ; and he has very obligingly offered me 
any further aid that I may need.

If the enemy should continue the war, I am inclined 
to think it may be nearer my home ; for surely they will not 
go far southward at this season. Nothing, I think, can they 
have in view but to distress us ; conquest they must despair 
of. When I left home, I conjectured that one campaign 
after the present would end the war. I now believe this 
one year will finish it. The sooner the better, for the sake 
of the lives, health, and happiness of thousands. And then, 
also, shall I return to enjoy, with my Becky, all the sweets 
of domestic life ; that quiet, ease, and heartfelt satisfaction 
which spring from the sincerest friendship and the tenderest love . . .
