SIR, 
</p><p>
To prevent the enemy's army, now marching across 
the Jerseys, from receiving any considerable reenforcement from the troops in and near <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I 
propose moving the main body of this army to the 
White Plains, and shall take a strong camp in that neighbourhood. I have all my cavalry, and a consider 
able body of infantry, now properly posted between 
the two rivers, to intercept the enemy's parties, and 
cut off their communication with the interior country, 
which has also given the alarm of an attack being 
meditated upon <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as confirmed by good intelligence, which Colonel Graham assures me he has 
received. Probably the slow movements of the enemy, joined to the obstructions thrown in their way, 
may so retard their march through the Jerseys as 
to give your Excellency an opportunity to harass 
them exceedingly with your dragoons and light infantry, aided by the militia, which will most assuredly 
produce, amongst other good things, a considerable 
desertion, and, perhaps, finally such an opening as 
may enable your Excellency to make a glorious finishing of the war. I should apprehend the enemy's re 
sours for provisions on their march must be scanty ; 
and, if they are once obliged to take a fixed position, 
or force your army from a very strong one, their 
desperation may be their ruin.

In order to eke out the magazine, I have increased 
the quantity of flour and rice, and reduced the meat. 
Of the two former we have large supplies. I think a 
quantity of cured shad might be sent us from the 
southward. I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
