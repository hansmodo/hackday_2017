DEAR SISTER:
</p><p>
It is hard for me to write my thoughts. If I was with you I could talk more in five minutes than I can write on two sheets of paper. But I must begin to practise at this kind of work more than I have done.
</p><p>
In regard to myself, I am very glad I left B. Here is the place to find business of all kinds and as my friends here interest themselves for me I think there is a prospect of my doing something. There is quite a change between living in the two places but I like a city the best. I shall make <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a> my home for the present. Tim Smith has introduced me to all his friends. I like his Cousin Bill very much. I walk up to see him at his uncle's on Sundays and go to church with him in the afternoon. I have made some acquaintances in Brooklyn and like the people very much but I had rather board in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a> and shall go in the Spring. I visit at Alfred's and Sarah's and Bigelow's very often. John and I go down to Sarah's about twice a week and have a good game of whist. That's forbidden fruit in Bucksport but here it is quite different. Public Opinion is not quite so strong against dancing, whist and the theatre here.
</p><p>
The ceremony of installing the pastor over the Pilgrim's Church came off last Thursday. The singing was very good. They have got a fine organ in this church. Next to Trinity it is the largest in the country. The best singing I have heard was at George Reatt's choir. He
beats Mason. The first treble singer is the best voice I ever heard. I wish our choir in B. could hear them once.
</p><p>
They have as much quarrelling in the choir here as at home. Bigelow and his wife have left because Uncle Richard said he had as leave hear it thunder as hear her sing. Others will not sing without pay. As they do not hire any singers they are jealous of each other, get mad and sit below. In fact singers are the same all over the world.
</p><p>
I have to work hard now but as soon as the canal closes it will be easy. I suppose you are froze up at home by this time. It begins to be cooler here but there is not much snow here in the winter. No sleigh riding for me this winter. All the riding I have is in the omnibus when I go up Broadway. It is cheap. You can go three miles for six cents.
</p><p>
The next journey you take come out here. Don't stop at Boston. That's small compared to this. If you want to see the fashions come out here and walk up Broadway at four in the afternoon and I will show you the two belles and all the lions of the day. Next year I shall expect to see you here.
