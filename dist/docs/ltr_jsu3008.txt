DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
You are to march as soon as possible with Colonel Irvine's 
and Colonel Wayne's regiments, together with those of <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>Colonel St. Clair</a> now remaining at this place, . and join <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>Colonel St. Clair</a> at Kicolet, and take command of the whole party; and 
unless you find the number of the enemy at Three Rivers to 
be such as would render an attack upon them hazardous, you 
are to cross the river, at the most convenient place you can, 
and attack them. You will pay particular attention to the preservation of your bateaux, keeping them at a convenient distance 
above the shipping, which lies at or near the Three Rivers. 
I would by no means advise to an attack, if the prospect of 
success is not much in your favor, as a defeat of your party 
at this time might prove the total loss of this country. 
</p><p>
Sir, as I have (without flattery) the highest opinion of the 
bravery and good conduct of yourself and the officers you command, I forbear attempting particular instructions, being well 
assured, that neither prudence nor resolution will be wanting to 
answer the great purpose we have in view. I have the highest opinion of the bravery and resolution of the troops you command, and doubt not but, under the direction of a kind providence, you will open the way for our recovering that ground, 
which former troops have so shamefully lost. Wishing you the 
greatest success and safety, I am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
