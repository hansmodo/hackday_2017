I AM extremely afflicted with the relation your father gave me of the return of your disorder. I fear you 
have taken some cold. We have had a most pernicious air, a great part of this spring. I am sure I have reason to remember it. My cold is the most 
obstinate and threatening one I ever had in my life. However I am unwearied in my endeavours to subdue -, 
it, and have the pleasure to think I have had some success. I rise at five, walk three miles, keep the 
air all day and walk again in the afternoon. These walks have done me more good than anything. My 
own infirmities, the account of the return of yours, and the public news coming altogether have put my utmost philosophy to tho trial. 
</p><p>
We live, my dear soul, in an age of trial. What will be the consequence, I know not The town of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, for aught I can see, must suffer martyrdom. 
It must expire. And our principal consolation is, that it dies in a noble cause the cause of truth, of virtue, 
of liberty and of humanity, and that it will probably have a glorious resurrection to greater wealth, splendor and power than ever. 
</p><p>
Let me know what is best for us to do. It is expensive keeping a family here, and there is no prospect of any business in my way in this town this 
whole summer. I Don't receive a shilling a week. We must contrive as many ways as we can to save 
expenses ; for we may have calls to contribute very largely, in proportion to our circumstances, to prevent 
other very honest worthy people from suffering for want, besides our own loss in point of business and profit 
</p><p>
Don t imagine from all this that I am in the dumps. Far otherwise. I can truly say, that I have felt more 
spirits and activity since the arrival of this news than I had done before for years. I look upon this as the 
last effort of Lord North's despair, and he will as surely be defeated in it, as he was in the project of the tea. I am, with great anxiety for your health,
