DEAR SIR, Notwithstanding the communications in your favor of the 18th ult, which has remained until now unacknowledged, it was the opinion of every judicious friend whom I consulted that your name could not be spared from the Deputation 
to the meeting in May, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. It was supposed, in 
the first place, that the peculiarity of the Mission, and its acknowledged pre-eminence over every other public object, may 
possibly reconcile your undertaking it with the respect which 
is justly due, and which you wish to pay, to the late officers of 
the Army; and, in the second place, that although you should 
find that or any other consideration an obstacle to your attendance on the serv.e, the advantage of having your name in the 
front of the appointment, as a mark of the earnestness of Virginia, and an invitation to the most select characters from every 
part of the Confederacy, ought at all events to be made use of. 
In these sentiments I own I fully concurred, and flatter myself 
that they will at least apologize for my departure from those 
held out in your letter. I even flatter myself that they will 
merit a serv.us consideration with yourself whether the difficulties which you enumerate ought not to give way to them. 
The affair of the Mississippi, which was brought before the 
Assembly in a long memorial from the Western members and 
some of the officers, has undergone a full consideration of both 
Houses. The resolutions printed in the papers were agreed to 
unanimously in the House of Delegates. In the Senate, I am 
told, the language was objected to by some members as too 
pointed. They certainly express in substance the decided sense 
of the Country at this time on the subject, and were offered in 
the place of some which went much farther, and which were in 
other respects exceptionable. I am entirely convinced, from 
what I observ.here, that unless the project of Congress [for 
ceding to Spain the Mississippi for 25 years] can be reversed, 
the hopes of carrying this State into a proper federal system 
will be demolished. Many of our most federal leading men are 
extremely soured with what has already passed. Mr. Henry, 
who has been hitherto the champion of the federal cause, has 
become a cold advocate, and in the event of an actual sacrifice 
of the Mississippi by Congress, will unquestionably go over to 
the opposite side. I have a letter from Col. Grayson of late 
date, which tells me that nothing further has been done in Congress, and one from Mr. A. Clarke, of New Jersey, which informs me that he expected every day instructions from his 
Legislature for reversing the vote given by the Delegates of 
that State in favor of the project.

The temper of the Assembly at the beginning of the session 
augured an escape from every measure this year not consonant 
to the proper principles of Legislation. I fear, now, that the 
conclusion will contradict the promising outset. In admitting 
Tobacco for a commutable, we perhaps swerved a little from 
the line in which we set out. I acquiesced in the measure myself as a prudential compliance with the clamours within doors 
and without, and as a probable means of obviating more hurtful experiments. I find, however, now, that it either had no 
such tendency, or that schemes were in embryo which I was not 
aware of. A Bill for establishing District Courts has been 
clogged with a plan for installing all debts now due, so as to 
make them payable in three annual portions. What the fate 
of the experiment will be I know not. It seems pretty certain 
that if it fails, the bill will fail with it. It is urged in support 
of the measure that it will be favorable to debtors and creditors both, and that, without it, the bill for accelerating justice 
would ruin the former and endanger the public repose. The 
objections are so numerous, and of such a nature, that I shall 
myself give up the bill rather than pay such a price for it.
