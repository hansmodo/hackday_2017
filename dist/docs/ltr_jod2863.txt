IT is worth the while of a person, obliged to write 
as much as I do, to consider the varieties of style. 
The epistolary is essentially different from the oratorical and the historical style. Oratory abounds with 
figures. History is simple, but grave, majestic and 
formal. Letters, like conversation, should be free, 
easy, and familiar. Simplicity and familiarity are the 
characteristics of this kind of writing. Affectation 
is as disagreeable in a letter, as in conversation, and 
therefore, studied language, premeditated method and 
sublime sentiments are not expected in a letter. Not 
withstanding which, the sublime as well as the beautiful, and the novel, may naturally enough appear, in 
familiar letters among friends. Among the ancients 
there- are two illustrious examples of the epistolary 
style, Cicero and Pliny, whose letters present you 
with models of fine writing, which have borne the 
criticism of almost two thousand years. In these 
you see the sublime, the beautiful, the novel and the 
pathetic, conveyed in as much simplicity, ease, freedom and familiarity, as language is capable of.

Let me request you to turn over the leaves of the 
Preceptor to a letter of Pliny the younger, in which 
he has transmitted to these days the history of his 
uncle's philosophical curiosity, his heroic courage 
and his melancholy catastrophe. Read it, and say, 
whether it is possible to write a narrative of facts in a 
better manner. It is copious and particular in select 
ing the circumstances most natural, remarkable and 
affecting. There is not an incident omitted, which 
ought to have been remembered, nor one inserted 
that is not worth remembrance. It gives you an idea 
of the scene, as distinct and perfect, as if a painter 
had drawn it to the life before your eyes. It interests 
</p><p>
your passions us much as if you had been an eye 
witness of the whole transaction. Yet there are no 
figures or art used. All is as simple, natural, easy and 
familiar as if the story had been told in conversation, 
without a moment's premeditation.

Pope and Swift have given the world a collection 
of their letters ; but I think, in general, they fall 
short, in the epistolary way, of their own eminence 
in poetry and other branches of literature. Very 
few of their letters have ever engaged much of my 
attention. Gay's letter concerning the pair of lovers 
killed by lightning, is worth more than the whole 
collection, in point of simplicity and elegance of 
composition, and as a genuine model of the epistolary 
style. There is a book, which I wish you owned, 
I mean Rollin's Belles Lettres, in which the variations 
of style are explained.

Early youth is the time to learn the arts and 
sciences, and especially to correct the car and the 
imagination, by forming a style. I wish you would 
think of forming the taste and judgment of your children now, before any unchaste sounds have fastened 
on their ears, and before any affectation or vanity is 
settled on their minds, upon the pure principles of 
nature. Music is a great advantage ; for style de 
pends, in part, upon a delicate ear. The faculty of 
writing is attainable by art, practice and habit only. 
The sooner, therefore, the practice begins, the more 
likely it will be to succeed. Have no mercy upon 
an affected phrase, any more than an affected air, 
gait, dress or manners. 
Your children hare capacities equal to any thing. 
There is a vigor in the understanding and a spirit 
and fire in the temper of every one of them, which 
is capable of ascending the heights of art, science, 
trade, war or politics. They should be set to com 
pose descriptions of scenes and objects, and narrations 
of facts and events. Declamations upon topics and 
other exercises of various sorts should be prescribed 
to them. Set a child to form a description of a 
battle, a storm, a siege, a cloud, a mountain, a lake, 
a city, a harbor, a country seat, a meadow, a forest, 
or almost any thing that may occur to your thoughts. 
Set him to compose a narration of all the little 
incidents and events of a day, a journey, a ride or a 
walk. In this way a taste will be formed, and a 
facility of writing acquired.

For myself, as I never had a regular tutor, I never 
studied any thing methodically, and consequently, 
never was completely accomplished in any thing. 
But, as I am conscious of my own deficiency in these 
respects, I should be the less pardonable, if I neglected the education of my children. In grammar, 
rhetoric, logic, my education was imperfect, because 
unmethodical. Yet I have perhaps read more upon 
these arts, and considered them in a more extensive 
view, than some others.
