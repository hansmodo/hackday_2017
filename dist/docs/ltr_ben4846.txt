SIR, 
</p><p>
Having visited yesterday, as you desired, the powder magazines at Purfleet, in order to see how they may be protected 
against danger from lightning, I think, 
</p><p>
1. That all the iron bars, which pass down along the 
arches, from the top to the place where the powder is 
deposited, should be removed; as they now constitute, 
with the brass hoops with which the casks are bound, an 
imperfect conductor; imperfect in proportion to the greater 
or less height to which the casks are piled ; but, in any case, 
such that they can only serve to attract towards the powder 
the first stroke that falls upon the arch; and that they are 
consequently very dangerous. 
</p><p>
2. That the building, which has a leaden coping along 
the ridge from one end to the other, may be secured by 
means of a pointed iron rod, carried up near each end, communicating with this coping, and extending through the rock 
of chalk, which serves as the foundation of the building, 
till it meets with water. This rod should be at least an inch 
in diameter, that it may be more durable, and afford the lightning a more free course through its substance ; and it should 
be painted, to preserve it from rust. Its upper extremity 
should be carried ten feet above the summit of the roof, 
and taper off gradually till it ends in a sharp point ; and, the 
better to preserve this point, the last six inches should be of 
brass, because it is less liable to become blunted by rust. 
If the rod cannot well be made entirely of a single piece, 
the different pieces composing it should be strongly screwed 
together, or into one another very closely, with a thin plate of 
lead between the joints, in order to render the junction or 
continuation of the metal more perfect. 
</p><p>
After all the electrical experiments that I have made in 
reference to this subject, and all the examples that have come 
to my knowledge of the effects of lightning on these conductors, it seems to me, that (provided they are good and perfect, 
carried down till water or very moist ground is reached) 
they are equally safe, whether placed directly against the wall, 
and secured by staples driven into it, or whether supported 
by a pole or staff planted in the ground, at some distance from 
the wall. The former is the better mode, as the rod can be 
bent to avoid the windows or doors, which are situated directly below the summit of the roof. Yet, as certain apprehensions may be more effectually set at rest by supporting 
the rods in the other manner, I should make no objection 
to this, provided that they can be suitably placed, without 
interfering with any passage, and that they are so firmly 
fixed that the wind cannot, by causing them to vibrate, interrupt the communication of iron or lead, between the side of 
the rod and the lead that covers the ridge. 
</p><p>
3. As I am informed that the roofs of the other four buildings are to be reconstructed after the model of that of which 
I have just been speaking, the same method may be followed 
with regard to them, when they are finished in this manner. 
But, if it be asked how they may be rendered secure in the 
mean time, I would advise, that, (as their roofs are now of a 
different form, being hip-roofs with four corners, and the 
joining at their corners, as well as their ridge-pieces, having 
a coping of lead, which extends to the gutters,) the passages, 
which it is proposed to carry down till water is reached, be 
bored or dug immediately, and that that part of each conductor, which is to be carried up from the water as high as the 
gutters, be fixed in them. From the top of this conductor 
I would carry out two arms of iron to the corners of the gutters, where the leaden coping of the corners of the roof should 
be united to the ends of these bars; and at the junction of 
these corners with the ridge-piece, I would carry up rods to 
the height of ten feet, pointed as directed above; which, 
when a new roof is made, could be used for the upper part of 
a straight conductor. I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. For that part of the conductor which is to be carried 
under ground, leaden pipes should be used, as less liable to 
rust.
