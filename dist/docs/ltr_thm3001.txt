DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The inclosed I have this minute received from an 
express sent by my order to <a href='/results.php?tla=jhc' rel='colleague'>General Cadwalader</a>. 
The General, not knowing that I was here, did not 
write to me, and as I supposed the contents of importance in my movements, I took the liberty to 
open the letter, for which I must plead only the 
occasion in excuse. 
</p><p>
I came here at four o clock this afternoon. Five 
hundred men, sent from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> yesterday, crossed 
to Burlington this morning. This evening I sent 
over near three hundred more. To-morrow seven or 
eight hundred shall follow. I will cross in the morning , and endeavour to form them into regiments, and 
a brigade. They consist of many different corps, and 
want much regulation. 
</p><p>
If your Excellency has any orders for me, other than to join <a href='/results.php?tla=jhc' rel='colleague'>General Cadwalader</a> as soon as possible, 
please to favor me with such as are necessary, and I 
will punctually obey them. Pennsylvania is at length 
roused, and coming in great numbers to your Excellency's aid. Mr. Hall will return with your orders. 
I am informed that we cannot cross at Bordentown, 
nor at any place between that place and this. I 
have no doubt of effecting it here, having sent from 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> in the morning several fine boats, which 
are now here. 
</p><p>
I most heartily congratulate your Excellency on 
your late capital stroke, and wish most ardently a 
repetition. I am, with great affection and attachment, 
Your Excellency's obedient servant, 
</p><p>
