Dear Henry: --
</p><p>
   Yours of the 22nd ult. was received in due time, but
not answered as soon as its demands required, but "better late than
never." [ "] so here goes." In my last I spoke of the sight presented in our
streets, but since that time things have changed considerably, and
the scenes presented in our streets on Friday and Saturday of last week
were quite a different aspect reality be stamped on every move.
On Friday five companies of Cavalry, the heroes of Sumpter (except
Maj. Anderson), four Regs. of troops, accompanied by their bands and
followed by their baggage wagons, which make a peculiar rum-
bling noise, this Brigade was six miles long ( Capt. McMullens
Philadelphia Rangers were in the crowd.) You may and can only
imagine what the effect of such [ a] scene would be, the sight
was the most sublime that I ever witnessed, the bands of
music with numerous fifes and drums, -- the heavy tread of about forty wagons, all conspired to bewilder the undrestanding
and render vague all our preconceived ideas of war.
The movements of Saturday were not quite so imposing, but
for the cavalry [ it] they would have been equally grand. Sabbath
approached finding our citizens in a state of uproar &
confusion, cars were running an screaming-men were working
wagons were moving through our streets from morning till night
and citizens [ were] on a continual parade. truly such scenes, such
sabbaths, and such times, were never before ours to behold.
Uncle Stumbaugh will in my opinion leave very soon, but when
I do not know, but think, to night or tomorrow, if you should happen
to see any of our folks and it is not to much trouble, you would
oblige me by telling them, that if they want to see him that
now is the time, Isadore has been confined to bed sick for several
days and doesn't seem to improve much, and I fear that he will
not be able to go along with his fellow soldiers.
</p><p>
   There were fifty wagons brought up on Saturday night, and by
seven O'Clock sunday morning they were all unloaded.
I received a letter from D.R.P. Shoemaker on Saturday. I must
answer it to day or to-morrow, he is yet at Pleasant Hill and
says that if anything would induce him to sholder a musket it would
be an invasion of old Franklin. good for him he seems
to be a Union man: even to the point of his nose, and [ so] he
should be.
</p><p>
You seemed to think that some other Nation might join with the South
but I believe our cause is a just one, and if, all the other nations
of the earth should join with their teeming millions and come
to our shores in battle array against us, that by trusting in the
god of battles, who I believe is superintending our movements, that
triumph must be ours, but we must do our share of the work and
stand right up to the mark, whether death be our lot a not
Henry, I have no fear of the result, we may lose many good
men, but if we go to the work right I feel confident of succes.
I am sorry that I have not time to answer your letter fully
but if you knew how often I have been called away from
my writing I know [ you] would excuse me, there has been about
eight person in here bothering me all the time, and no person in
the office to be bothered but myself as Messrs. Carlisle &
Stewart have not reached yet. if I have time I [ will] try and
do better the next time. [ Give] my respects to all inquiring
friends if any there be.
</p><p>

Yours very Respectfully
</p><p>
Alex. Cressler

P.S. [illeg.] Wright soon but come up
sooner or I will pull your ears.
</p>
Ellic.
