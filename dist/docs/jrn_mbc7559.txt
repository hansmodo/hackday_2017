<a rel='month origin' value='5'>May</a> <a rel='day origin' value='13'>13th</a>  [<a href='/results.php?city=montgomery' rel='city origin'>MONTGOMERY</a>, Ala., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. We have been down from Montgomery on the boat to that God-forsaken landing, Portland, Ala. 
Found everybody drunk that is, the three men who were there. At last secured a carriage to carry us to my brother-in-law's house. Mr. Chesnut had to drive seven miles, pitch dark, over an unknown road. My heart was in my mouth, which last I did not open.

Next day a patriotic person informed us that, so great was the war fever only six men could be found in Dallas 
County. I whispered to Mr. Chesnut: " We found three of the lone ones hors de combat at Portland." So much 
for the corps of reserves alcoholized patriots.

Saw for the first time the demoralization produced by hopes of freedom. My mother's butler (whom I taught 
to read, sitting on his knife-board) contrived to keep from speaking to us. He was as .efficient as ever in his proper 
place, but he did not come behind the scenes as usual and 
have a friendly chat. Held himself aloof so grand and stately we had to send him a "tip" through his wife 
Hetty, mother's maid, who, however, showed no signs of disaffection. She came to my bedside next morning with 
everything that was nice for breakfast. She had let me sleep till midday, and embraced me over and over again. 
I remarked "What a capital cook they have here !" She curtsied to the ground. "I cooked every mouthful on that 
tray as if I did not know what you liked to eat since you was a baby."
