My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your very welcome & interesting letter of the 21st   ult was duly 
rec d as well as a number of extracts from various newspapers in relation 
to the Mexican War, our operations against <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> as well as some 
other matters of interest, for all of which you have my sincere thanks. 
Cap 1 Eaton my aid got back here on or about the 30th  ult but brought 
not a particle of intelligence with him of interest on any subject ; from 
what he could learn while at Washington, I am satisfied the authorities 
there were at a loss what to do, whether to push our operations farther in 
this direction which cannot be very well done, to hold on to what we have 
got, or to operate against Vera Cruz ; I am however of opinion but little 
will be done until <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">the President</a> has time to consult congress in regard to 
the farther prosecution of the war, conforming to the views of a majority 
of his party in regard to the same. The next three months will in all 
probability bring about important results as regards this War, the great 
national councils it is supposed of both countries being now in session, 
I hope they will not seperate or break up, without bringing about a peace 
between us, or laying the foundation of one ; for if it is not done & that 
in a few month it may continue for several years, far beyond what any 
of us calculate on. I regret to hear that Dr Russell has returned in bad 
health as I had hoped & expected that his visit to the North would have 
completely set him up again. Surg n Finlay has not mentioned the sub 
ject of a transfer with him or any one else 
</p><p>
I rec d a letter about a week since from Betty at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> of the 
9 th ult informing me that Ann & all the children had reached there in 
good health & without accident. I concluded as a matter of course that 
there had been some outbreak with Bob, for had he been left behind, 
Betty would have mentioned it. I must say I regret his leaving, as his 
doing so must distress his mother, besides evincing a disposition not to 
be controled which may greatly injure if not prevent his succeeding in 
any of the various pursuits through life, but this nor any thing els should 
prevent us from doing the best we could for him, leaving the results to 
providence. Betty says there was respectable schools at Baton Rouge for 
all of them, & they had all been entered at them, & commenced attend 
ance the morning she wrote ; & I hope they will at any rate not lose any 
portion of what they have already acquired ; if John continues in delicate health it might be advantageous for him to make a visit to Fort Polk 
& spend a few days with you ; but I hope there will be no necessity for 
him to do so, & that a winter at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> will fully reestablish his 
health

The state in which your brother left the business intrusted to him 
ought to be & no doubt is a source of great gratification to his family & 
friends, & it is highly creditable to his memory, at the same time I am 
not a little surprised at the small am c you state he has accumilated ; but 
the high character he has left his children will be a better legacy to them, 
& ought to be more highly prized by them than thousands under other 
circumstances It is a pitty your good mother should ever be made 
acquainted or undeceived in regard to his fate ; I presume there cannot be 
doubt of his having accidentally fallen overboard.

If this war is to continue congress will have to double the army, 
increase the pay of the rank & file so as to induce enlistments as it will 
be found out of the question to carry it on much longer with volunteers ; 
those now here are beginning to look many of them to their homes with 
much anxiety, & will leave the moment if not before their time expires, 
& of course will have to be replaced before leaving, so that we must have 
a double set or double the number of that descript of troops needed to 
carry on the war, under pay at the same time ; which in addition to 
rations, transportation of every kind & their waste of public property, 
would in a few years break down any treasury in the world ; but this I 
will leave to the wise legislators & other dignitaries of the land, to find 
out & apply the corrective in this as well as other matters. That the 
war is an unpopular one, as regards a majority of the people of the 
country there cannot be a doubt, & the result of the recent elections in 
some of the large states proves conclusively that owing to the war, tarif, 
vetoing the appropriations for improving rivers & harbors, Mr Polk & 
his immediate advisers are completely broken down for the present ; 
there must be a majority in the lower branch of the national legislature against them after the 4th of March next so as to embarrass all their 
operations ; how it will all end time must determine, & I must say I 
look forward with great anxiety as to the cors of things in our present 
congress as well as in that of Mexico connected with this war I am 
fully sensible as well as duly grateful that the people or a majority of 
them have & and are ready to award me an ample share of credid for my 
sacrifices in this war notwithstanding the open & covert attacks & insinuations of numerous letterwriters & other, envious & sycophantic who 
envy acts they cannot emulate or are not inclined to accomplish ; but are 
anxious to reduce their superiors to a level with themselves by detraction 
of the basest kind, & description, in a way which they cannot be detected ; 
however so far as I am concerned their insinuations or attacks give me 
no concern ; as to the attack, movement &c on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> they origin 
ated with me, as well as finding the means of transportation, which the 
agents of the govt was not able to supply after trying four or five months, 
is as Mr Vanburen 1 would say, " glory enough for me," & to spare a 
considerable quantity to others who deserve but little, which they are disposed to make a great deal of, for themselves and their employers at the 
expense of truth, &c. There is now but little reliance to be placed on 
most of those filling prominent places, or those who are overrly anxious 
to do so. The late elections or rather their results I think will prevent 
many of those of the present party in power, who are looking forward to 
the White House from assailing me, as their hopes in regard to the same 
must be at an end for some years to come ; & the whigs I trust as their 
prospects are brightening will fix on some able politician to fill that high 
station without connecting my name with the same ; for could I reach 
the presidency by announcing publicly my wishes to that effect, I certainly would never arrive at the same ; at the same time I will not say I 
would not serve if the good people were to be inprudent enough as to 
elect me ; but I would much prefer at the close of the present war, in a 
great measure to retire from the bustle of public life, & to pass the few 
days or years which may be alotted me in quietness if not in retirement 
</p><p>
I shall leave here in a few days for Victoria & some other towns 
situated at the foot of the Sierra Madre, & may go as far as Tampico 
with a portion of my com d for the purpose of taking possession of & 
occupying some two or said towns, as well as to make myself acquainted 
with the several passes through the mountains referred to, in the direction 
of San Luis Potosi, how far they can be used for wheel carriages &c 
should it be found necessary to push our operations in that direction 
</p><p>
The arrangement you suggested as regards Dr Russell was this 
moment laid before me by Surg n Finlay & the same complied with 
</p><p>
I do not expect to return to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> from my trip above referred 
to short of six weeks unless some movement of the enemy should render 
it necessary for me to do so ; so you need hardly expect to hear from 
me before that time ; I now write under constant interruption & am 
doubtful of your being able to read what I have written 
</p><p>
Wishing you & yours continued health & prosperity I remain truly 
</p><p>
& sincerely

Your Friend
