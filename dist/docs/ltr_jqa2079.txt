</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I received two or three days since your favors of March 26, 
April 21 and 26, all together, and I know not how to express 
the pleasure they gave me. The first and dearest of all 
my wishes is personally to give satisfaction, and obtain 
the approbation of my parents, and in a public capacity 
to justify the confidence placed in me by the appointment I 
now hold. This wish is in both parts so abundantly gratified 
by the warm and cordial expressions used in your letters, that 
I have nothing left to desire but a continuance of that kindness and indulgence which I have always experienced from 
you, and which the government has been pleased to bestow upon my first performances in their service. 
</p><p>
Every suggestion or intimation of advice from you will 
always be received with gratitude by me, because I know from long experience, that it will operate to my own ad 
vantage in its use. The officer I mentioned to you in one of my first letters, and with respect to whom you give me 
a caution, never had any confidence from me. His adventure here, and his claims and those of his friends for my 
official services, embarrassed me not a little upon my first arrival. But as I was from the first moment guarded 
by my suspicions, I refused all interference in his affair beyond what I considered as an obligation of duty. By 
doing more I should have paid my court more effectually to the Patriots, who are now at the head of affairs, but I had 
not forgotten that I was not sent here to make myself a partizan of Dutch factions, and I had upon that occasion 
at least the advantage of discovering, what has since received ample confirmation, that I must be content with coolness 
from the patriotic party as well as from the other, and must reconcile myself philosophically to the certainty of being no favorite with either side. 
</p><p>
I have endeavored in my letters to you hitherto to preserve a chain of general intelligence relative to the most 
important political affairs of Europe. Since my last letter, or rather while I was writing it, a furious insurrection broke 
out against the Convention, which was during two days upon the point of a general massacre, and one member of 
which was killed by a pistol shot, and his head was carried on a pike in the Hall of the Convention itself. The revolt 
however was eventually suppressed, and as soon as the 
victory of the Assembly was ascertained, they appointed a 
military commission of five members to try all offenders concerned in that conspiracy. By this tribunal six members 
of the Convention have recently been condemned to death. 
All six attempted to anticipate the execution by their own 
hands, three of them succeeded, but the rest suffered according 
to the judgement. Three other members of the Convention 
prevented even their trial by a voluntary death. Several 
others are still reserved for trial, and in all probability will 
have the same fate. All this proceeds from a deadly aversion to the sanguinary system of terror pursued in the time 
of Robespierre. But this singular species of humanity, this energetic abhorrence of cruelty, is not confined within 
the limits of legal forms. In many of the departments the former murderers are murdered with as little ceremony, 
the drowners are drowned. The mere name of Terrorist is a title to proscription, and how often the name is given by 
private malice for the sake of producing the proscription, is not told. These excesses are disapproved by all the 
sober part of the nation, they are disapproved even by the Convention, but they are committed every day, and there is 
no power competent to restrain or to punish them. On the other hand the war in the Vendee again blazes out with 
extreme violence, as is said. A sort of treaty had been signed by the deputies of the Convention on the one side and 
the principal leaders of the rebellion on the other. The latter were promised pardon and protection, engaging to 
submit to the laws of the Republic. It is now said they 
were perfidiously dissimulating; that they have violated the 
pacifications. Twenty-five or thirty of them have been 
arrested and sent to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> for trial, and the Convention 
has decreed that the violation of the treaty is an offence punishable with death. 
</p><p>
At Toulon a Jacobin insurrection was for some time 
successful. It extended to the fleet then in the harbor, and 
prevented it from sailing to meet the British fleet in the 
Mediterranean. A member of the Convention in mission 
there was driven to despair by this event, and shot himself. 
But this revolt was of short duration ; order was soon re 
stored, and the fleet has now sailed. 
</p><p>
The son of Louis the i6th died in the temple on the 8th of this month. His sister, the only remaining child 
of the late King, it is said, is very ill. The surgeon who attended the boy in his illness died a few days before 
him. A proces verbal, signed by four health officers, by order of the Committee of General Surety, declares that 
the death was owing to a scrofulous disease of long continuance. 
</p><p>
In the midst of all these events the arms of the Republic continue to be victorious. Luxemburg not long since 
capitulated, and a garrison of twelve thousand men returns to Germany engaging not to serve against the French 
or their allies during the war. Mentz alone now remains to be taken on the left side of the Rhine. A peace between 
France and the German Empire becomes probable. But the Emperor and Great Britain, or at least the latter, will remain at war. 
</p><p>
The perseverance of the British government is founded upon their confidence in their naval superiority, which is now 
established more decisively than it has ever been. The French government, to make a parade of commanding the 
seas, sent their large fleet of thirty-six men of war to cruise to and fro in the channel, through the months of 
December and January last. They enjoyed the satisfaction of naval empire at their full leisure. It was not for a moment 
disputed, and indeed scarcely perceived in a season when commerce is not fond of frequenting the channel. The 
price at which this enjoyment was purchased was the total loss of seven ships of the line wrecked in a tempest, and all 
the fleet so shattered and disabled, that it has not yet been repaired, and will be able to do nothing this season. It 
is possible that one effort more will be made in the Mediterranean, but the reasonable Frenchmen begin to give up even 
the pretension of contesting the sea during the present war. They did expect that their success in this country could have 
proved essentially advantageous to them, and upon their first 
arrival here you would have imagined they were landing 
upon the English coast. They soon discovered their error. 
The naval force of this country was magni nominis umbra, 
and if the French did not take possession of all they found 
in the ports of this Republic by right of conquest, it 
was merely because all they found was really not worth 
taking. The Batavians have stipulated in their treaty 
of alliance to have twelve ships of the line and eighteen 
frigates during this season ready for sea. They will probably 
not have half the number. At this moment there does 
not appear to be a single frigate or man of war fit for sea, 
and the British come and take prizes in full sight of the Texel itself. 
</p><p>
On the strength of their maritime supremacy the British government have revived their system of famishing their 
enemies into submission, and as they were unable to protect the Hollanders as friends, they have concluded to starve 
them too. All neutral vessels laden with provisions bound to France or Holland are to be captured by the British 
armed vessels and carried into their ports, the freights and cargoes to be paid. 
</p><p>
The policy of the British government seems to consider 
military operations as the least essential part of war. The 
pride, pomp and circumstance of their hostility consist not 
in the neighing steed, the shrill trump, the spirit stirring 
drum, the ear piercing fife, or the royal banner, but in 
forgery and famine. Their troops have been the terror 
of their friends and the derision of their enemies, but their 
artists are inimitable at counterfeiting an assignat, and 
their frigates and privateers are invincible against the mer 
chant vessels of neutral nations. Trahit sua quamque voluptas : every man has his predilection for some particular 
species of glory. That of conquering by famine and forgery may have its charms too, and however destructive such a 
contest may be, the victory would at least have the advantage of being bloodless. 
</p><p>
It is however at this time tolerably well ascertained that the system of starving will not be more successful this time 
than it has been heretofore. The scarcity of bread is undoubtedly great in France and in this country too, but every 
other article of provision is in usual plenty. The season is said to be uncommonly promising, a considerable variety 
of vegetables which can serve to supply the place of bread have already reached their maturity, even in this northern 
climate, and every day from the present moment will add 
some new article to the stores. The usual period of the 
harvest is rapidly approaching, and the British government 
will once more be obliged to console themselves for the 
failure of their design by the consciousness of its efficacy. 
The mere intention to famish thirty millions of the human 
race is a n effort that must carry its own reward along with it, 
and even its failure will be not much less glorious than 
would be its success. 
</p><p>
Since the conclusion of the treaty between the French and Batavian Republics nothing very material has taken place 
here. The same languor and imbecility which characterized the former government are equally discovered by the 
present : no vigor, no exertions, no public spirit, but abundance of commonplace about liberty, equality and the rights 
of man ; abundance of invective against the House of Orange and its partizans, abundance of patriotic exultation, together 
with frequent ebullitions of rage restrained and of revenge repressed but ready to burst forth in all its violence against 
the rotten part of the nation, the slavish subalterns of their oppressors, that is against all the members of the former 
regencies. This spirit of turbulence is preserved and 
stimulated by the popular societies, as numerous and almost 
as mischievous here as they are elsewhere. The other day 
at Rotterdam, in consequence of some flaming resolves of 
the popular society there, a mob of several thousand people 
assembled together, went to the State House and demanded 
of the municipality to order all the members of the former 
Regency immediately under arrest. The municipality 
remonstrated, stating that the people were not legally 
assembled, that their demand was contrary to the rights of 
man, inasmuch as they had made no specific charge against 
the persons whose arrest they desired. To this grave and 
serious objection the only reply to the municipality was, 
that if they had any regard for their own lives, they must 
instantly comply with the wishes of the people, and they 
complied accordingly. The mob then chose a committee to 
come and demand of the Provincial Assembly the same 
measure of severity to be extended through the Province. 
The Assembly entered into a sort of negotiation with them, 
annulled the order that had been extorted from the municipality of Rotterdam, discharged the persons confined under 
it from arrest, excepting only the former high officer whose 
arrest is continued, because the people of Rotterdam appear to 
be very much irritated against him, and promise that they will 
pay all proper attention to the wishes of the people. The 
collection of well-disposed people (the name assumed by the 
irregular assembly,) are not satisfied with these measures, 
their secretary makes a formal protestation against them, 
and publishes it in the newspapers. The members of the 
municipality at Rotterdam, indignant at the violence to 
which they had been forced to yield, all resign and after 
wards at the request of the Provincial Assembly consent to 
continue in office for the present. 
</p><p>
The character, the situation and temper of the Provincial 
Assembly of the municipalities in general, of the popular 
societies, and of the peuple patriot?, are all displayed more 
clearly in this one transaction than could be done by a volume 
of description or argumentation. In the rulers you see 
moderation, a regard for good principles, and a sense of the 
duties annexed to their stations, but all subordinate to complaisance for the popular will, and still more to personal 
fear. In the popular societies and their emanations, the 
thirst for party vengeance, the want of confidence in the 
nominal rulers so lately the objects of their own choice, the 
contempt of all principles upon which political and civil 
liberty must be founded, and the defiance publicly pro 
claimed of all the authorities which have so recently been 
created, are equally discernible. I have related this anecdote 
therefore as a specimen from which it may be judged what 
the present state of affairs here is. Many others might be 
told, bearing in a degree the same distinctive marks, and 
all would tend to the confirmation of the same conclusion. 
In the meantime the project of making a new Constitution 
is yet held forth, and the States General have lately sent 
to the Provincial Assemblies for their acceptance a plan for 
the convocation of a National Convention. This plan is 
considered as a thing of so little consequence, that it has not 
even been published in any of the French newspapers of the 
country. I have therefore made a translation of it from 
the Dutch for the Secretary of State, and send a copy of it 
also to you, because it is really an object of curiosity, and 
because I am glad to have an opportunity of showing you 
that I have not entirely neglected the language. 
</p><p>
I shall perhaps take another opportunity to communicate 
the observations which this plan suggests in relation to the 
state of public opinion upon the theory of government, but at present I must remember I am writing a letter and not a volume. 
</p><p>
I have at length received instructions, which relieve me from all embarrassment with respect to the conduct I have 
to hold in the changes which have been, and yet will be, 
taking place around me. Hitherto I have had no occasion to take any step that could cause particular remark, and if 
I have not made myself violent friends and admirers in the party, by subscribing to their clubs and joining in their 
processions, neither have I made myself obnoxious by any conduct or remarks that could be offensive to them. The 
other neutral Ministers and even the Portuguese have constantly remained here. I have found them all very polite obliging and friendly. 
</p><p>
I have the same acknowledgment to make with respect to the French Representatives and Generals who have been 
in this country. It is due to them all excepting Sieyes, who in the only conversation I had with him spoke of the government of the United States in a manner different from the 
others, and who was answered by me in a manner equally different from that I had used with the rest. I have related the conversation in a letter to the Secretary of State. 
</p><p>
I am, &c.
