DEAR SIR: In answer to the inquiries contained in your note of this morning, I submit the following statement I very distinctly recollect to have 
heard <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> (I think in the summer of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>) in conversation with 
Eldred Simpkins, Esq. relative to the proceedings of Gen. Jackson in the 
Seminole war, and to the course pursued by the cabinet, touching those 
proceedings. Mr. Crawford spoke without any kind of reserve as to the 
respective parts taken by the different members of the cabinet while the 
subject was under deliberation. He stated that you had been in favor of an 
inquiry into the conduct of Gen. Jackson, and that he was the only member of the cabinet that had concurred with you. He spoke in strong terms 
of disapprobation of the course pursued by Gen. Jackson, not only in his 
military proceedings, but in prematurely bringing the grounds of his defence 
before the country, and forestalling public opinion, thus anticipating the administration. Oa this point he remarked, that if the administration could 
not give direction to public opinion, but permitted a military officer, who 
had violated his orders, to anticipate them, they had no business to be at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>, and had better return home I also remember that the National 
Intelligencer, which was lying on the sofa where <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> was sitting, 
contained an article explanatory of the grounds upon which the administration had proceeded in regard to Gen. Jackson's military movements. Mr. 
Crawford adverted to some part of theiarticle, which laid down a principle 
of the law of nations, if I mistake not, which went to show that a neutral 
territory could only be invaded in fresh pursuit of an enemy, and added, 
"<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> denies all that." He represented Mr. Adams as going much 
further in justifying Gen. Jackson than even <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Monroe</a>, stating that the 
latter was induced to pass over the conduct of Gen. Jackson without public censure, not from a belief that he had not violated his orders and exceeded 
his power, but from political considerations connected with our relations 
with Spain.
