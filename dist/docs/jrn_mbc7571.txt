Mr. Brewster came here with us. The cars were jammed with soldiers to the muzzle. They 
were very polite and considerate, and we had an agreeable journey, in spite of heat, dust, and crowd. Rev. Robert 
Baruwell was with us. He means to organize a hospital forsick and wounded. There was not an inch of standing-room even; so dusty, so close, but everybody in tip-top spirits.

Mr. Preston and Mr. Chesnut met us at Warrenton. Saw across the lawn, but did not speak to them, some of 
Judge Campbell's family. There they wander disconsolate, just outside the gates of their Paradise: a resigned 
Judge of the Supreme Court of the United States : resigned, and for a cause that he is hardly more than half in sympathy with, Judge Campbell ?'s is one of the hardest cases.
