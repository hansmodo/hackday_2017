<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='4'>4th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=montgomery' rel='city origin'>MONTGOMERY</a>, Ala., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>].

I have seen a negro woman sold on the block at auction. She overtopped the crowd. I was walking and felt faint, 
seasick. The creature looked so like my good little Nancy, a bright mulatto with a pleasant face. She was magnificently gotten up in silks and satins. She seemed delighted with it all, sometimes ogling the bidders, sometimes looking 
quiet, coy, and modest, but her mouth never relaxed from its expanded grin of excitement. I dare say the poor 
thing knew who would buy her. I sat down on a stool in a shop and disciplined my wild thoughts. I tried it Sterne 
fashion. You know how women sell themselves and are sold in marriage from queens downward, eh? You know 
what the Bible says about slavery and marriage; poor women! poor slaves! Sterne, with his starling what did 
he know? He only thought, he did not feel.

The New York Herald says : <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln's</a> carriage is not bomb-proof; so he does not drive out." Two flags and a bundle of sticks have been sent him as gentle reminders. The sticks are to break our heads with. The English are 
gushingly unhappy as to our family quarrel. Magnanimous of them, for it is their opportunity.
