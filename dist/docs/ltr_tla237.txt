Dear JP-
<p> Just a word of greeting to my new son-in-law-almost! You certainly took us by surprise, but we offer you our most sincere congratulations and hope that you and our girl will be very happy together.
<p> She&#8217;s a grand girl, even if I did almost spoil her in the raising, but she offered lot&#8217;s of problems. She needed to get out of herself and above herself, more than anything- getting away from home seems to have done it, but we do miss her so much.
<p> Wish we could be on hand, but we&#8217;ll be pulling for you.
<p> Best of luck, always, and may God&#8217;s richest blessing&#8217;s be yours.
<p> Most sincerely,
<p> Mary King
