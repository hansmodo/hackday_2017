DEAR SIR *********** 
"The Question of policy," you say, "is whether it will be better to correct the vices of the Confederation by recommendation 
gradually as it moves along, or by a Convention. If the latter 
should be determined on, the powers of the Virginia Commissioners are inadequate." If all on whom the correction of these 
vices depends were well informed and well disposed, the mode 
would be of little moment. But as we have both ignorance and 
iniquity to combat, we must defeat the designs of the latter by 
humouring the prejudices of the former. The efforts for bringing about a correction through the medium of Congress have 
miscarried. Let a Convention, then, be tried. If it succeeds in 
the first instance, it can be repeated as other defects force themselves on the public attention, and as the public mind becomes 
prepared for further remedies.

The Assembly here would refer nothing to Congress. They 
would have revolted equally against a plenipotentiary commission to their deputies for I/he Convention. The option, therefore, lay between doing what was done and doing nothing. 
Whether a right choice was made time only can prove. I am 
not, in general, an advocate for temporizing or partial remedies. 
But a rigor in this respect, if pushed too far, may hazard everything. If the present paroxysm of our affairs be totally neglected our case may become desperate. If anything comes of 
the Convention, it will probably be of a permanent, not a temporary nature, which I think will be a great point. The mind 
feels a peculiar complacency in seeing a good thing done when 
it is not subject to the trouble and uncertainty of doing it over 
again. The commission is, to be sure, not filled to every man's 
mind. The History of it may be a subject of some future tete a tete.
