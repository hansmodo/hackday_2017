<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='27'>27th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=chester' rel='city origin'>CHESTER</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. I have moved again, and now I am looking from a window high, with something more to see than the 
sky. We have the third story of Dr. Da Vega's house, which opens on the straight street that leads to the railroad about a mile off.

Mrs. Bedon is the loveliest of young widows. Yesterday at church Isaac Hayne nestled so close to her cap-strings 
that I had to touch him and say, "Sit up ! " Josiah Bedon was killed in that famous fight of the Charleston Light Dragoons. The dragoons stood still to be shot down in their tracks, having no orders to retire. They had been forgotten, 
doubtless, and they scorned to take care of themselves.

In this high and airy retreat, as in Richmond, then in Columbia, and then in Lincolnton, my cry is still : If they 
would only leave me here in peace and if I were sure things never could be worse with me. Again am I surrounded by 
old friends. People seem to vie with each other to show how good they can be to me.

To-day Smith opened the trenches and appeared laden with a tray covered with a snow-white napkin. Here was 
my first help toward housekeeping again. Mrs. Pride has sent a boiled ham, a loaf of bread, a huge pancake ; another 
neighbor coffee already parched and ground; a loaf of sugar already cracked; candles, pickles, and all the other 
things one must trust to love for now. Such money as we have avails us nothing, even if there were anything left in the shops to buy.

We had a jolly luncheon. James Lowndes called, the best of good company. He said of Buck, " She is a queen, 
and ought to reign in a palace. No Prince Charming yet; no man has yet approached her that I think half good enough for her."

Then Mrs. Prioleau Hamilton, nee Levy, came with the story of family progress, not a royal one, from Columbia 
here : " Before we left home," said she, " Major Hamilton spread a map of the United States on the table, and showed 
me with his finger where <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> was likely to go. Womanlike, I demurred. "But, suppose he does not choose to 
go that way ? Pooh, pooh ! what do you know of war ? So we set out, my husband, myself, and two children, all in 
one small buggy. The 14th of February we took up our line of march, and straight before <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman's</a> men for five weeks 
we fled together. By incessant hurrying and scurrying from pillar to post, we succeeded in acting as a sort of 
avant-courier of the Yankee army. Without rest and with much haste, we got here last Wednesday, and here we mean 
to stay and defy <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> and his legions. Much the worse for wear were we.

The first night their beauty sleep was rudely broken into at Alston with a cry, " Move on, the Yanks are upon us! " 
So they hurried on, half-awake, to Winnsboro, but with no better luck. There they had to lighten the ship, leave 
trunks, etc., and put on all sail, for this time the Yankees were only five miles behind. " Whip and spur, ride for 
your life! " was the cry. " <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman's</a> objective point seemed to be our buggy," said she; " for you know that 
when we got to Lancaster <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> was expected there, and he keeps his appointments ; that is, he kept that one. Two 
small children were in our chariot, and I began to think of the Red Sea expedition. But we lost no time, and soon we 
were in Cheraw, clearly out of the track. We thanked God for all his mercies and hugged to our bosoms fond hopes of 
a bed and bath so much needed by all, especially for the children.

" At twelve o clock General Hardee himself knocked us up with word to l March ! march ! for all the blue bon 
nets are over the border. In mad haste we made for Fayetteville, when they said : l God bless your soul ! This is the 
seat of war now; the battle-ground where <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Johnston</a> are to try conclusions. So we harked back, as the 
hunters say, and cut across country, aiming for this place. Clean clothes, my dear ? Never a one except as we took off 
garment by garment and washed it and dried it by our camp fire, with our loins girded and in haste. I was snug 
and comfortable all that time in Lincolnton.

To-day Stephen D. Lee's corps marched through only to surrender. The camp songs of these men were a heart 
break ; so sad, yet so stirring. They would have warmed the blood of an Icelander. The leading voice was powerful, 
mellow, clear, distinct, pathetic, sweet. So, I sat down, as women have done before, when they hung up their harps by 
strange streams, and I wept the bitterness of such weeping. Music ? Away, away ! Thou speakest to me of things which 
in all my long life I have not found, and I shall not find. There they go, the gay and gallant few, doomed; the last 
gathering of the flower of Southern pride, to be killed, or worse, to a prison. They continue to prance by, light and 
jaunty. They march with as airy a tread as if they still believed the world was all on their side, and that there were 
no Yankee bullets for the unwary. What will <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston</a> do with them now?

The <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> melodrama is over, though the curtain has not fallen on the last scene. Cassandra croaks and makes many 
mistakes, but to-day she believes that <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> stock is going down. When that style of .enthusiasm is on the wane, the 
rapidity of its extinction is miraculous. It is like the snuffing out of a candle; " one moment white, then gone for 
ever." No, that is not right; it is the snow-flake on the river that is referred to. I am getting things as much 
mixed as do the fine ladies of society. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>Lee</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Johnston</a> have each fought a drawn battle ; only a few more dead bodies lie stiff and stark on an unknown 
battle-field. For we do not so much as know where these drawn battles took place.

Teddy Barnwell, after sharing with me my first luncheon, failed me cruelly. He was to come for me to go down 
to the train and see Isabella pass by. One word with Isabella worth a thousand ordinary ones! So, she has gone 
by and I Ve not seen her.

Old Colonel Chesnut refuses to say grace; but as he leaves the table audibly declares, I thank God for a good 
dinner." When asked why he did this odd thing he said: 
" My way is to be sure of a thing before I return thanks for it." Mayor Goodwyn thanked <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> for promised protection to Columbia; soon after, the burning began. 
</p><p>
I received the wife of a post-office robber. The poor thing had done no wrong, and I felt so sorry for her. Who 
would be a woman? Who that fool, a weeping, pining, faithful woman? She hath hard measures still when she 
hopes kindest. And all her beauty only makes ingrates !
