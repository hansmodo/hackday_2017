DEAR SIR,
</p><p>
I cannot forbear expressing my surprise at the principle 
advanced by a certain gentleman, with respect to the appointment of civil officers. To be consistent, he should go 
one step farther ; or, rather, he might be more explicit, and 
say, that unless a man have a brawny arm and the heart of a 
lion, or, in other words, if he possess not the prime qualities of an executioner, he is unfit for a judge! But, for my 
own part, I would choose to bear the reproach of humanity, 
and a tender feeling for my brethren of mankind, especially 
my fellow-citizens, on the point of being exposed to all the 
calamities, the numberless calamities, of civil war, rather 
than, upon opposite principles, be advanced to the highest 
posts, and so possess, with infamy, the reward of savage 
ferocity and barbarism. What does common sense pronounce to be the proper qualifications of a judge ? Are they 
other than these, integrity, ability, and knowledge of the 
law? Who, in searching for a judge, a discerner between 
truth and falsehood, right and wrong, would, before all 
things, inquire for a man of conquering attributes, for a 
hero ? 
</p><p>
With regard to the instance in question, tis true I 
differed in opinion from some others. I said we were not 
prepared for war, and that war to me appeared not unavoidable : hence arose my wishes still longer to forbear avowed 
hostilities. Dr. Warren a man deservedly esteemed and 
honored urged strenuously the pushing into <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> and 
cutting off the troops before a re enforcement should arrive. 
I declared instantly my opinion, that it was then impracticable. I know my opinion did not prevent it ; but it was 
not done. And were I now to say, even now the Colonies 
are unprepared for war, the declaration would not be wholly 
destitute of truth. Ask <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a> : he 11 tell you 
he is obliged to remain most mortifyingly inactive, and 
receive, without reply, the enemy's unceasing insults. This 
he declared to me last week. But, admitting my opinion to 
be unfounded, must I from thence be concluded my country's enemy, or timid friend? Suffer me to mention a fact. 
In 1745, in our House of Representatives, this question was 
agitated : Is it practicable to take Louisburg? It was long 
and calmly debated, and at length determined in the affirmative by a majority of one voice only. What now was to 
be done with the minority ? Should they be expelled the 
House because they were less sanguine than their brethren, 
and be excluded from offices? The cases, I think, are not 
unlike. The question being once determined, the minority 
were as active as their opponents in setting forward the 
expedition ; and, by a remarkable series of fortunate events, 
it happily succeeded. God grant our present enterprise 
may be alike successful ! My efforts have not been wanting, 
to the utmost of my ability ; and, had I been actually a member of the army, I could scarcely have spent more time in its 
service. Since the 19th of April, one month would much 
more than comprise all my labor and attention to my own 
affairs. And a hundred pounds, lawful money, would not 
tempt me again to go through the application and fatigue of 
writing my military treatise. You will, Sir, excuse this 
tedious epistle. I am bound, in justice to myself, to mention 
these things, to show how extremely unreasonable it would 
be to refuse me such offices as I am qualified to discharge for 
the trifling cause referred to, or rather for no cause at all. 
</p><p>
I do not say this because I regret my missing a certain appointment. I repeat what I told you, that, whatever I may 
be hereafter, when study and experience have matured my 
judgment, I am at present unfit for that important trust. 
Had the appointment taken place, I think I must have declined it, lest I should by accepting it disgrace myself and 
injure and dishonor my country. For the present is the 
most important period since the Colony was founded ; and 
never was there a greater necessity of filling the offices of 
government with men of integrity, ability, and knowledge, 
both on account of the difficulty of the times, and that our 
adversaries and posterity [may have no ground] for vilify 
ing, stinging reflections ; for sorry should I be to see the 
Colony again reproached, and its senators and leaders 
styled, ignominiously, "Dii minorum gentium."
I do not repeat my petition. You know me ; so do 
others; and your discernment, and sense of the dignity 
becoming freemen, will lead you to expect no servile en 
treaties from me. A slave may present them at the shrine 
of power ; but a liberal mind will reject the offering with 
disdain. 
</p><p>
I am, Sir, with great regard, your obliged friend, &c.
