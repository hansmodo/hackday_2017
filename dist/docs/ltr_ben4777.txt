DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have just received a letter from Mr. Winthrop, dated 
December 7th, containing the following account, viz. 
"On Thursday, the Qth of November, I had an opportunity of observing a transit of Mercury. I had carefully adjusted 
my clock to the apparent time, by correspondent altitudes of 
the Sun, taken with the quadrant for several days before, and 
with the same reflecting telescope as I used for the transit of 
Venus. I first perceived the little planet making an impression on the sun's limb at 2 h 52' 41" ; and he appeared wholly 
within at 53' 58" apparent time. The sun set before the planet 
reached the middle of his course ; and for a considerable time 
before sunset, it was so cloudy, that the planet could not be 
discerned. So that I made no observations of consequence, 
except that of the beginning, at which time the sun was 
perfectly clear. This transit completes three periods of 
forty-six years, since the first observation of Gassendi at 
Paris, in <a href='/results.php?year=1631'>1631</a>." 
</p><p>
I am, Sir, with great esteem, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
