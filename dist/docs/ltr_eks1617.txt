. . . We did not land as we expected, on the morning of the eighth, as we were threatened with a norther, 
but remained at our anchorage. On the ninth the 
weather proving mild, the movement commenced at 
daylight. The First Brigade were mostly transferred 
to armed vessels; near two thousand to the Flagship 
" Raritan," including a portion of our regiment and 
my company. The steamers took the vessels in tow, 
and all started for the Island of Sacrificios, dropping 
our anchors about noon between that island and the 
main. Sacrificios is about twelve hundred yards from 
the shore where there is a good landing, three miles 
from the city and the castle, just beyond cannon range. 
</p><p>
We could see a few Mexican soldiers on shore, but no evidence of any large force to oppose our landing, 
though we did not know but there might be batteries 
and troops behind the sand hills. Our division as 
rapidly as possible debarked in the surf boats, and 
were ranged in order of battle about a quarter of a 
mile from the beach awaiting the signal to move to 
the shore. This was an interesting moment, and must 
have been a grand spectacle from the yards and tops 
of the shipping. Soon a cannon was fired at head 
quarters, the steamer " Massachusetts," and with 
loud cheers we pushed for the beach, each hardy 
sailor using his utmost exertion to be the first to land. 
The entire division reached the shore in good order, 
every one leaping from the boats as their keels grated 
on the sand, wading the short distance that remained. 
We were at once formed in order of battle and advanced over the sand hills. We met with no opposition, not a single gun being fired. As we gained the 
crest of the hill, we could see a few Mexicans, but 
they were far off and not in force. It was near sunset 
when we gained our position. The boats returned 
immediately to bring the second line, composed of 
Patterson s division, the third being Twigg s brigade. 
As the night closed in we lay down on the sand, every 
alternate company remaining up to prevent surprise. 
About two o clock I was roused from a deep sleep by 
the cry " To Arms," and the rattle of musketry on 
our right where there was apparently a smart skirmish. 
I was at once ordered with my company in front as 
a picket. I forced my way through the chaparral and 
over the broken ground, some three or four hundred 
yards to the front, where I took up a position that 
overlooked the country in advance. The firing had 
ceased and we were not again molested during the 
night. At daylight I was recalled and ordered to the 
right of the brigade as one company of a battalion of 
skirmishers under Captain C. F. Smith. The battalion 
is composed of four companies, and I am acting as 
major of the command. We shall probably remain 
detached from our regiment during the siege. Our 
movement for investing the city began on the morning of the tenth. We, the skirmishers, were thrown 
forward to feel the ground. We could see about a 
quarter of a mile in front some two or three hundred 
Mexican soldiers, and a squadron or two of cavalry 
in the valley. We exchanged some shots without 
effect, though the escopet balls whistled over our 
heads. A few Congreve rockets were thrown at them 
and a shell or two from a mountain howitzer, upon 
which they retreated. The position of Worth's division is on the right or south of the town, its right 
flank resting on the sea. Our line of investment will 
extend a mile or so from the shore. From Worth's 
left flank the line is to be kept up by Pillow's Brigade, 
and so on to the left where the Third Brigade under 
Twiggs is to rest on the sea to the north of the city. 
By noon on the tenth, Worth had occupied his position and General Patterson s division, composed of 
Pillow s, Shield s, and Quitman s Brigades, marched 
to the left to continue the line of investment. Pillow's 
command was soon engaged with the enemy as we 
knew by the continued firing from them. We learned 
in the evening that they had gained their position 
without loss. The <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">New York</a> regiment occupied a 
large magazine in rear of Patterson s division. During the day, the enemy were throwing solid shot and 
shells from their heavy guns and mortars which generally fell short, though some reached the line causing 
a little beautiful dodging and much laughter. As the 
night closed in we bivouacked. On the eleventh the 
troops of General Patterson s division were still 
moving to the left, while the First (General Worth s) 
were engaged in reconnoitring and getting some of 
our camp equipage and provisions on shore. I saw 
Colonel Plympton and Edmund in the evening, both 
well. The Colonel has grown old since you saw him 
and I think is breaking, though his conversation is as 
lively and entertaining as ever. On the twelfth, 
Twiggs moved with his brigade to the left, having to 
fight much of his route, with some loss. Captain 
Alburtis of the Second Infantry was killed by a round 
shot which carried away his head as he was sitting 
under a tree. The same shot took off the leg of a 
corporal and wounded a third person. Lieutenant 
Colonel Dickinson of the South Carolina regiment 
and five or six men of the rifles were wounded. The 
enemy in these skirmishes must have suffered considerably, a Mexican officer bearing dispatches to 
the Capital was among their killed. I was out all the 
night of the twelfth in command of two companies 
in the hope of intercepting a reenforcement, supposed 
to be coming in from Alvarado. 
</p><p>
I was interrupted here by an order for the light 
battalion to take two days provisions in their haversacks and advance to drive in the enemy s outposts, 
and if possible to get position in the suburbs. I have 
been gone two days, but will take up my story where 
I left it. 
</p><p>
On the morning of the thirteenth, I returned from 
my picket on the Alvarado road, and we heard in the 
course of the day that the investment was completed. 
The weather is extremely disagreeable, a north wind 
blowing violently, nearly burying us in sand and preventing all communication with the ships. We regret 
very much that we cannot get our mortars and heavy 
guns on shore until there is a calm, as little can be done 
here until our batteries are in position. Duncan's 
light battalion and the Dragoons have not yet 
arrived and some anxiety is felt for their fate. We 
on shore were much disgusted at seeing a ship under 
French colors run the misnamed blockade carrying 
succor to the enemy, without the least apparent effort 
to intercept them from the navy, which were quietly 
lying at anchor. The armed steamers ought and 
could easily capture any vessel attempting to enter 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a>. The gentlemen of the navy say it is entirely the fault of Commodore Connor and complain 
bitterly of the inactivity in which they are kept. On 
the fourteenth, in the morning, I was interrupted as 
I before stated, while trying to give you some account 
of what is going on. In compliance with the order 
spoken of, our battalion was soon in motion and by 
cutting our way through dense chaparral and by 
keeping under the sand hills we advanced a mile 
toward the city without being seen from it or the 
castle. I was here placed in a small indentation in 
the top of a sand hill in command of two companies, 
which were a reserve, and designed to support any 
advance parties which might be attacked. Here we 
remained twenty-four hours drenched with rain and 
nearly buried in the driving sand. Save the excite 
ment of the whizzing of some passing ball (designed 
for our friends in the rear) whose flight we watched 
with some anxiety, there was nothing to relieve the 
monotony of our position. We were much fatigued 
on the morning of the fifteenth, when General Worth 
came to our position and ordered us to advance. We 
proceeded very cautiously in a small path which had 
been cut through the bushes advancing very gradually wherever we came to a place where there was 
any danger of being seen from the city. We soon 
came upon our advanced party under C. F. Smith, 
who were lying at the base of a hill among some very- 
ancient tombs. I must be more brief. Captain 
Walker was thrown forward with his company to a 
large cemetery near the wall of the city, and I was 
ordered to remain about two hundred yards in his 
rear to support him in case he was attacked. While 
lying with my company in this place prostrate upon 
the ground, the enemy amused themselves by throw 
ing shells at us, only two of which struck near us, - 
one exploded a few yards to our left, and one struck 
about fifteen feet to my right, and rolled out of the 
hole very near Rossell and myself. We lay very close 
to the ground some minutes waiting for it to burst. 
Then I went and examined it and found very fortunately for us that the fuse had been broken off by its 
striking the ground. Towards night Walker thought 
himself threatened by cavalry from the city, and I 
advanced to his assistance. It was, however, only a 
small reconnoitring party which soon retired. The 
cemetery where we are stationed is a large rectangular 
enclosure surrounded by a high brick wall. In its 
centre is a chapel surmounted by a graceful dome. 
We were unable to advance beyond this point without 
being exposed to the direct fire of the enemy s batteries. It rained nearly all night and by morning we 
were all pretty well worn out by two nights picket 
duty. We were relieved about dawn on the sixteenth 
by the Fifth Infantry under Major Scott, and returned 
to camp dirty, wet, cold, and hungry. I found my 
self covered with wood ticks and red bugs, and although for more than twenty-four hours I have 
constantly applied salt ammonia and oil, I am covered 
with inflamed blotches from head to foot. We re 
ceived today particulars of Taylor s great but bloody 
victory. 
</p><p>
March 17. . . . The siege progresses slowly owing 
to the equinoctial storm which prevents the landing 
of our mortars and ordnance. The investment, how 
ever, is complete and I do not think the enemy can 
communicate with the interior. Several of their expresses have been intercepted, in all of which they 
speak of the great terror of the inhabitants and of 
their want of provisions. I think when our batteries 
are established we shall make short work of it, and 
without much danger to ourselves as we shall only 
be exposed to their vertical fire, that is shell, which 
are not very destructive. Bob T is here, 
master of the " Princeton." I have seen him once 
he is a fine, manly sailor, and I understand has abandoned all the wild habits of his boyhood. The mail 
goes by the " Alabama " in the morning, and I must 
close this rude letter which, bad and imperfect as it 
is, has cost me no little trouble under all the disadvantages for writing which I have had to encounter. 
I shall write as usual when I can, but my details must 
be very imperfect as I am confined by duty to my 
own brigade. The left flank, where Edmund is, is 
several miles from us. Not a word I write must get into 
the papers. . . .
