It is cloudy today, much to the relief of us poor mortals who have been gasping with the mercury at 96 in the shade all last week. On Monday it cooled off a little and we had a steady thunder shower from noon till midnight. 'The electric fluid magnified' on Grace Church and shivered the Cross on the spire. (I don't wonder at that church being visited.) Also struck in Hoboken and burned several houses. I was over to the North River and saw it.

Last Sunday I spent at Mr. Thompson's, down in Jersey. There were five of us went down and we had a delightful time (barring the mosquitoes). His farm is in the midst of a fine section of country and his house stands on the bank of a small river. Taking it altogether, it is one of the prettiest places that I have ever visited.

We rode to church, eleven of us, in his family vehicle. Went to a regular country church, reminded me of Orland on the Hill. All the eyes in the house were directed at Thompson's pew. His daughters are decidedly the Bon Ton of the village. We strolled over the fields, went in bathing and smoked any quantity of cigars. You can't imagine how I enjoy the fields and woods after staying so long on paved streets.

How does Tim enjoy himself? He thought he should be very discontented. Tell him the best remedy is to go to work. How does Gen. Taylor's cause flourish in Bucksport? Does Father go in for him? I intend to vote for him next fall if I live. Have you given up your journey to the White Mountains? I hope you will be able to go and while you are about it you better go to Saratoga. Enjoy yourself now while you are young. What is the use to spend the best part of your life at home? That is my doctrine.

Well, I guess when you have read this letter, as Mose says, you will make the observation: gas! But I have written just what comes into my head, hit or miss.
