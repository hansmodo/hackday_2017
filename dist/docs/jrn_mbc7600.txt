Mr. Miles says he is not going anywhere at all, not even home. He is to sit here permanently chair 
man of a committee to overhaul camps, commissariats, etc., etc.

We exchanged our ideas of Mr. Mason, in which we agreed perfectly. In the first place, he has a noble presence really a handsome man; is a manly old Virginian, straightforward, brave, truthful, clever, the very beau-ideal 
of an independent, high-spirited F. F. V. If the English value a genuine man they will have one here. In every particular he is the exact opposite of Talleyrand. He has some peculiarities. He had never an ache or a pain him 
self ; his physique is perfect, and he loudly declares that he hates to see persons ill ; seems to him an unpardonable weakness.

It began to grow late. Many people had come to say 
good-by to me. I had fever as usual to-day, but in the excitement of this crowd of friends the invalid forgot fever. 
Mr. Chesnut held up his watch to me warningly and intimated " it was late, indeed, for one who has to travel to 
morrow. " So, as the Yankees say after every defeat, I retired in good order.

Not quite, for I forgot handkerchief and fan. Gonzales rushed after and met me at the foot of the stairs. In 
his foreign, pathetic, polite, high-bred way, he bowed low and said he had made an excuse for the fan, for he had a 
present to make me, and then, though " startled and amazed, I paused and on the stranger gazed. Alas ! I am 
a woman approaching forty, and the offering proved to be a bottle of cherry bounce. Nothing could have been more 
opportune, and with a little ice, etc., will help, I am sure, to save my life on that dreadful journey home.

No discouragement now felt at the North. They take 
our forts and are satisfied for a while. Then the English are strictly neutral. Like the woman who saw her husband 
fight the bear, It was the first fight she ever saw when she did not care who whipped.

<a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis</a> was very kind about it all. He told Mr. Ches-nut to go home and have an eye to all the State defenses, 
etc., and that he would give him any position he asked for if he still wished to continue in the army. Now, this would 
be all that heart could wish, but Mr. Chesnut will never ask for anything. What will he ask for? That's the rub. I 
am certain of very few things in life now, but this is one I am certain of: Mr. Chesnut will never ask mortal man 
for any promotion for himself or for one of his own family.
