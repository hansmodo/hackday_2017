My Dear Brother :

Here in this country the Democratic a mob element prevails to such a degree that, as you will have observed, the influence of governor, mayor, and all the 
executive authority has been utterly disregarded. For 
three months here we have been governed by a selfconstituted committee, who have hung four men, banished some twenty others, arrested, imprisoned, and 
ironed many more, and who now hold a judge of the 
Supreme Court in their power. . . . There is no doubt 
we have a bad administration of law here, and more 
than a fair share of rowdies ; but I think the Committee 
itself no better, and if we are to be governed by the 
mere opinion of the Committee, and not by officers of 
our own choice, I would prefer at once to have a Dictator. The Committee is now in a bad fix. The man 
whom Terry stabbed is now well. The Executive Committee of Vigilance are now willing to acquit him, but 
before they can act in such 'a matter by their by-laws, 
they must submit the case to a Board of Delegates, composed of three from each of their military companies. 
This Board of Delegates, of course, want action, and they 
insist that Terry shall resign his office and go away, or 
be hung. There is a sloop-of-war here, the John Adams, 
whose commander says that he will intercept any ship 
that attempts to carry Terry off ; so that it will be difficult for them to banish Terry, and it is not impossible 
that they may yet hang Terry to save themselves the 
consequences of his return to the Bench. If there is not 
an entire revolution and withdrawal from the Union, 
then all these acts of violence must come up before 
our courts on actions for civil damages, and it is likely, 
if Terry returns to the Bench, he will have some feeling 
against the men who have kept him imprisoned some 
two months, with daily expectation of death or banishment. We are waiting to hear what President Pierce 
will do in the matter. I doubt whether he will interfere as long as these men do not try to bring about an 
absolute revolution, which I do not think they have yet 
contemplated. My own opinion is, the committee is 
tired of its position, but find it difficult to withdraw 
from the complications in which they are involved. 
</p><p>
Affectionately your brother,
