<p>
TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, January 17, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1781">1781</a>.
</p><p>
Sir,
</p><p>
I do myself the honor of transmitting to your Excellency a resolution of
the General Assembly of this Commonwealth, entered into in consequence
of the resolution of Congress of September the 6th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1780">1780</a>, on the subject
of the Confederation. I shall be rendered very happy if the other States
of the Union, equally impressed with the necessity of that important
convention, shall be willing to sacrifice equally to its completion.
This single event, could it take place shortly, would overweigh every
success which the enemy have hitherto obtained, and render desperate the
hopes to which those successes have given birth.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the most real esteem and respect,
</p><p>
your Excellency's most obedient and most humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="me">Th: Jefferson</a>.
</p>
