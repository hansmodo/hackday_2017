My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
Contrary winds, heavy rains, disappointments of vessels, and every inconvenience for which we had no 
remedy, have been, from the day of my arrival, combined against our embarkation. I hope, however, we 
shall be on board to-morrow morning ; and, as nothing 
certain has been heard from the French ships, no time 
will be lost on our part for the celerity of the expedition. The troops will embark five miles below 
this place, and three miles higher up than the point 
where <a href='/results.php?tla=roh' rel='colleague'>General Howe</a> landed. There will be more 
room for the arrangement of our vessels, and the shallowness of water insures us against the enterprises of 
any vessel of force. In this situation we may wait 
for intelligences from our friends. 
</p><p>
The State of Maryland have made to me every offer in their power. I will improve this opportunity 
of making up some deficiencies in the Quarter-master's 
and Engineer's departments, and of insuring to us a 
good stock of provisions. Upon the intelligence received that <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague met'>Baron Steuben</a> was gone with a large detachment to the southward, I had hinted the possibility of getting some militia from the lower counties, 
and repairing some cannon at <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>. But, having 
read the inclosed letter from the Baron, I will write 
again to Governor Lee (as my letter has been gone 
but two days), and save the State from any expense 
of that kind. 
</p><p>
To the obtaining of the vessels, has been joined 
the difficulty of getting them up the river, as they 
were taking every opportunity to slip off. All the 
vessels, three excepted, are only Bay crafts, and our 
Admiral ship mounts twelve guns. I have prepared 
some kind of orders for that fleet, but hope to be relieved from my naval command by the arrival of a 
French frigate, and have, at all events, sent for Commodore Nicholson, of <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>. Mr. McHenry has 
been very active in accelerating the measures of his 
State. 
</p><p>
By a letter from Colonel Gouvion, dated Wicomico 
River, I find that, after many adventures, he had 
landed there on the 4th, and was proceeding by land 
to his destination. The wind is fair enough to come 
up the Bay, and I hope soon to hear from our friends. 
The inclosed letter from the Baron, having first come 
into my hands, and being on public service, as it was 
written upon io he forwarded uith desjxdch, I took the 
liberty to open it, but was very sorry to have done 
it after a letter of the same date had come also to 
my hands. Both say the same thing (at least in 
every material point), and I am happy to find that 
the Baron's preparations are going on rapidly. 
</p><p>
Whatever may be the Baron's opinion upon the 
facility of taking, sword in hand, the fortifications at 
<a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, I will not hazard any thing before I have 
considered the matter with my own eyes. Arnold had 
so much time to prepare, and plays so deep a game; 
nature has made the position so respectable ; and some 
of the troops under his orders have been in so many 
actions, â€” that I do not flatter myself to succeed so 
easily as it may be thought. The prospect of preserving naval superiority must, I think, decide, if we 
are to have blood shed by regular approaches, or to 
risk our men in the dangers of an assault. But I 
would like to destroy the works in some measure, 
before we attempt to storm them. A conversation 
with the Baron, with Colonel Gouvion, and some other 
officers, joined to what I can see myself, will better 
fix my mind on the matter than it can be at present. 
</p><p>
When I left <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a> was not 
far from hoping he could soon collect a thousand 
men. But I am not so sanguine in my expectations. 
I am, however, trying to prepare matters for these 
men, but think that a sufficiency of vessels (unless 
ours are sent back) will not be obtained within a few 
days. Let <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a> arrive in time, or not, 
when he comes under my direction I wish to know, 
if, in case we succeed, he must be sent on to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>. Supposing he is to go tliere, would your 
Excellency think of selecting some riflemen for the 
Grand Army ? It seems to me that I heard you once mentioning this matter. 
</p><p>
The State of Virginia, I am told, finds difficulties 
in the keeping of prisoners. Suppose something of 
the kind was stated to me, am I to alter any thing 
in what you said to me on the subject ? I am in a 
great hurry to go, my dear General, but, let us succeed or fail in the object we have in view, I shall 
not be less hurried to return with the detachment to 
head-quarters, where I hope to be again as soon as 
you may possibly expect. 
</p><p>
With the highest respect, and most tender affection, I have the honor to be, my dear General, &c., 
</p><p>

P. S. I beg you will present my respects to Mrs. 
Washington and Mrs. Hamilton, and my compliments 
to the family.
