</p><p>
Dear Christman:--You express some desire to return and state that you are tired of California. You want to know my opinion of business. If you have accumulated enough, or any considerable portion towards commencing business, come home at once, by all means. But if you think you are doing better in California than you might do here, hesitate before you return. This is weighing your return on purely business grounds.
</p><p>
To draw a line between the doings of yourself and me for the past two years, I would at once say you have done the better. I do not complain, nor do I despair. But what I state is a fact. I have not the slightest reason to entertain a hope of any proposition to share or have an interest in the profits of the Village Record establishment. Not the least. In regard to this you labor under a great mistake. It has never seriously entered my head. Within three weeks Mr. Evans will leave for the Senate, for a three years' absence, when all the duties of the office, editorially and mechanically, will fall under my superintendence. Yet nothing of this kind has been even intimated. This you ought to consider conclusive. At least I do.
</p><p>
From experience, and other causes, my services have become almost indispensable in the office. I labored incessantly for Mr. Evans' nomination, and to my exertions he is probably indebted for his seat in the State Senate. I did not do this out of an interested motive, or with any object of future benefits to myself. I know his character well, and have discovered his
weak points. His post in the Senate will be a laborious one. Chester County wants much legislation.
</p><p>
After his arrangements are pretty well fixed for his departure for Harrisburg, I will notify him of what will be to him a startling fact--that I will expect an increased salary in the future--say not less than $10 and probably $12 per week. Should he refuse, he will soon lose my services, for I can get $15 per week elsewhere. I do not think he would be so great a fool as to drive me from him. My services are worth $20 per week to him now. He can go away for weeks and months, and his business will go on during his absence as if he were at home. This is precisely the position I stand.
</p><p>
Well, that daguerreotype has taken us by surprise. You look like a Turk. It made Mr. Evans laugh. I think it is a very true likeness. Your brother Jefferson said he did not know it. He said you looked savage and just looked to him like a sailor.
</p><p>
Do not infer from what I have said that I do not wish to see you home. No indeed. You know me--how I was opposed to your going to California. But since you have risked so much to reach it, give it a fair trial. I have watched your movements there with more than a brother's regard. No one will receive you with a warmer heart than myself when you think it is best to return to your earlier friends. May success crown your efforts.
</p><p>
Write often, and in detail, and I remain
</p><p>
In haste,
</p><p>
