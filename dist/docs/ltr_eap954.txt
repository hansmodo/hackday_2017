My Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>:--I received your very welcome letter of August 10th and according to your request hasten to answer. I generally look for your letters several days before I get them, but your last one arrived the very day I expected it, which was a great pleasure to me. I read it with eagerness, for it was kind and
affectionate. I think you had better make up your mind to come home. Let the hills of gold stay where they are if you cannot get them without risking your life or health.

I visited my sister and while in the city I had my ears pierced. I am perfectly satisfied with the saying that pride must be punished for they have been just as sore as they could be ever since.

There is very little news except political. The men all seem to have their heads filled with that. Father was nominated by the Democratic party for the office of treasurer but he did not think of such a thing as being elected. He had not been to a political meeting for years, and never talked politics to any person. He is a strong temperance man. He said he would never have believed that men would have been guilty of the little, dirty tricks that he had seen since he was nominated. He said he would never get an office if it required him to give drinks and lower himself to speak to men that he did not respect or countenance before. Mr. Evans was nominated for Senator. The Whigs carried the whole ticket in Chester County, so of course Father was defeated but not disappointed, for he had made up his mind long ago that if it was to be gained by electioneering he would never be elected.

Mrs. Joseph Henderson requested me to ask you about her brother. He keeps a restaurant and hauls provisions. His name is Jonathan Roberts.

I think it very likely by the time you return, Mr. Prizer will be a married man. Take good care of yourself, and try to make yourself believe that it will be better for you to come home.
</p><p>
From yours sincerely and devotedly,
