Camp, at <a href='/results.php?city=phillipsburg' rel='city origin'>Phillipsburg</a>, <a rel='day origin' value='17'>17</a> <a rel="month origin" value="8">August</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1781' rel="origin">1781</a>. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
In consequence of the despatches received from your 
Excellency by the frigate <a href='/results.php?city=concord' rel='city'>Concord</a>e, it has been judged 
expedient to give up for the present the enterprise 
against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and turn our attention towards the 
south, with a view, if we should not be able to attempt 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> itself, to recover and secure the States of 
Virginia, North Carolina, and the country of South 
Carolina and Georgia. We may add a further inducement for giving up the first-mentioned enterprise, which 
is the arrival of a reinforcement of near three thousand 
Hessian recruits. For this purpose we have determined to remove the whole of the French army, and 
as large a detachment of the American as can be 
spared, to the Chesapeake, to meet your Excellency 
there. 
</p><p>
The following appear to us the principle cases, which 
will present themselves, and upon which we shall be 
obliged ultimately to form our plans. We have therefore stated them with a few short observations upon 
each. Your Excellency will be pleased to revolve 
them in your mind, and prepare your opinion by the 
time we shall have the pleasure of meeting you in 
Virginia. 
</p><p>
First, What shall be done, if the enemy should be 
found with the greater part of their force in Virginia, 
upon the arrival of the French fleet I Secondly, What 
shall be done, if a detachment only shall be found 
there? Thirdly, What shall be done, if the British 
force be totally withdrawn from thence? 
</p><p>
As to the first, it appears to us, that we ought, without loss of time, to attack the enemy with our united 
force. 
</p><p>
As to the second, it appears proper to destine such part of our force as will be amply sufficient to reduce 
the enemy's detachment, and then determine what use 
shall be made of the remainder. And here two things 
present themselves for our consideration. The enemy 
will either have sent the greater part of their force from 
Virginia to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> or to <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. If to New 
York, (which is the least probable under present circumstances,) <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> will have but a moderate garrison, and it may be possible to attack it to advantage. 
If to <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, then the enemy will be so superior to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>, that they will be able to regain the 
whole of the State of South Carolina, and of consequence Georgia. We therefore think, that, in this latter 
case, such a force at least should be detached to South 
Carolina, as will enable us to keep the field and confine the enemy in or near <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. 
</p><p>
In the third case we mean, that, supposing the enemy 
should have totally evacuated Virginia, it appears to us necessary to make a solid establishment at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, 
or any other place if more proper, in order to render 
a fleet in the Chesapeake Bay entirely secure, and to 
employ the remainder of our land force and such vessels as may be proper for the service, as has been explained in the preceding article ; that is, either in the 
siege of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, if the garrison shall be found sufficient to warrant the attempt, or to cover and secure 
the country, should it be found otherwise. 
</p><p>
Returning to the enterprise against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> will 
depend on a number of circumstances, the discussion 
of which we will leave until we have the happiness of 
a conference with your Excellency. We have only to 
observe, that the execution of all or any of the plans, 
which we have proposed, goes upon the supposition of a 
decided naval superiority; except that of marching a 
reinforcement into South Carolina. 
</p><p>
We would beg leave to take up so much of your 
time, as to point out to you the vast importance of 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, and what advantages the enemy derive from 
the possession of it. It is the centre of their power in 
the south. By holding it they preserve a dangerous influence throughout the whole State, as it is the only 
port, and the only place from whence the people can 
procure those articles of foreign produce, which are essential to their support ; and it in a great measure 
serves to cover and keep in subjection the State of 
Georgia. From thence the enemy can also establish 
small posts in North Carolina ; and, if they maintain a post in the Chesapeake, they keep up the appearance 
of possessing four hundred miles upon the coast, and of consequence have a pretext for setting up claims, which may be very detrimental to the interests of America in European councils. 
</p><p>
We are not sufficiently acquainted with the position of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> (neither is it necessary at this time) to enter into a detail of the proper mode of attacking it, 
or of the probability which we should have of succeeding. For these we will refer you to Brigadier-General Duportail, commander of the corps of engineers in the 
service of the United Slates, who will have the honor 
of presenting this. That gentleman, having been in 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> as principal engineer during the greater part 
of the siege, and in the environs of it as a prisoner of 
war a considerable time afterwards, had opportunities 
of making very full observations, which he judiciously improved. 
</p><p>
A variety of cases, different from those we have 
stated, may occur. It is for this reason we have 
thought proper to send General Duportail to your Excellency. He is fully acquainted with every circumstance of our affairs in this quarter, and we recommend him to you as an officer, in whose abilities and 
in w hose integrity you may place the fullest confidence. We would observe, that it will lie very essential to the despatch of the business in contemplation, for you to send up the Elk River, at the head of 
the Chesapeake Bay, all your frigates, transports, and 
vessels proper for the conveyance of the French and 
American troops down the bay. We shall endeavour 
to have as many as can be found in <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> and 
other ports secured, but we have reason to believe 
they will be very few. We have the honor to be, 
with the greatest respect, attachment, esteem, &,c.
