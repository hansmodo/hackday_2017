HAD a Declaration of Independency been made 
seven months ago, it would have been attended with 
many great and glorious effects. We might, before 
this hour, have formed alliances with foreign states. 
AVe should have mastered Quebec, and been in 
possession of Canada. You will perhaps wonder 
how such a declaration would have influenced our 
affairs in Canada, but if I could write with freedom, 
I could easily convince you that it would, and explain 
to you the manner how. Many gentlemen in high 
stations and of great influence, have been duped 
by the ministerial bubble of Commissioners to treat. 
And in real, sincere expectation of this event, which 
they so fondly wished, they have been slow and 
languid in promoting measures for the reduction of 
that province. Others there are in the Colonies who 
really wished that our enterprise in Canada would be 
defeated, that the Colonies might be brought into danger and distress between two fires, and be thus induced to submit. Others really wished to defeat the 
expedition to Canada, lest the conquest of it should 
elevate the minds of the people too much to hearken 
to those terms of reconciliation, which, they believed, 
would be offered us. These jarring views, wishes 
</p><p>
and designs occasioned an opposition to many salutary 
measures, which were proposed for the support of 
that expedition, and caused obstructions, embarrassments, and studied delays, which have finally lost us the province. 
</p><p>
All these causes however in conjunction would 
not have disappointed us, if it had not been for a 
misfortune which could not be foreseen, and perhaps, 
could not have been prevented I mean the prevalence of the small pox among our troops. This 
fatal pestilence completed our destruction. It is a 
frown of providence upon us, which we ought to lay 
to heart. 
</p><p>
But, on the other hand, the delay of this Declaration to this time has many threat advantages attending 
it. The hopes of reconciliation, which were fondly 
entertained by multitudes of honest and well mean 
ing, though weak and mistaken people, have been 
gradually and, at last, totally extinguished. Time 
has been given for the whole people maturely to consider the great question of independence, and to ripen 
their judgment, dissipate their fears, and allure their 
hopes, by discussing it in newspapers and pamphlets, 
by debating it in assemblies, conventions, committees 
of safety and inspection, in town and county meetings, 
as well as in private conversations, so that the whole 
people, in every colony of the thirteen, have now 
adopted it as their own act. This will cement the 
union, and avoid those heats, and perhaps convulsions, 
which might have been occasioned by such a Declaration, six months ago. 
</p><p>
But the day is past The second I day of July, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>, will be the most memorable epocha in the 
history of America. I am apt to believe that it will 
be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great 
anniversary Festival. It ought to be commemorated, 
as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized 
with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, 
guns, bells, bonfires and illuminations, from one end of this continent to the other, from this time forward, forever more. 
</p><p>
You will think me transported with enthusiasm, but I am not I am well aware of the toil, and blood, 
and treasure, that it will cost us to maintain this Declaration, and support and defend these States. 
Yet, through all t^e gloom, I can see the rays of ravishing light and $lory. I can sec that the end is 
more than worth all the means. And that posterity will triumph in that day's transaction, even although 
we should rue it, which I trust in God we shall not.
