My dear General, 
I have a few days ago written to you by M. de Moustier, the new Minister from this Court. He is a 
sensible and honest man, with whom I think that the 
people of America will be satisfied. He is very desirous to be presented to you, and I have invited 
him in your name to INIount Vernon, as well as Madame cle Brehan, a very agreeable lady, his sister-inlaw, who goes out with him. 
</p><p>
Inclosed here, my dear General, is the copy of an official letter to Congress, wherein I have expressed 
my sentiments on the present state of affairs. 
What is become of the happy years, my beloved General, when, before my sentiments were formed, I had 
time to model them after your judgment? This comfort at least remains for me, â€” to endeavour guessing 
what your opinion will be on every case that occurs. 
</p><p>
There is nothing new since my last. Amsterdam has ended her resistance, and there are now States 
Generals and Provincial States for each of the seven Provinces regularly elected, which are, to a man, bound 
to the Stadtholderian party. It is one of the vices of their Constitution, that the voice of their Magistrates, howsoever elected, is mistaken for the voice of the nation.

<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> and myself are now employed in 
commercial affairs for the United States. M. de Calonne's letter will be framed into an arret of the 
Council, and additional favors will be so adjusted as 
to take in every thing that is consistent with this 
Government. The disposition of the Minister is as 
good as we can wish ; and I am happy in the good 
fortune America had, that such a man as <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> was sent to this country. Nothing as yet is decided with respect to war. If it breaks out, the fjiult 
will be with England. The new Secretary at War 
has created a Board of General Officers, to carry on 
the affairs of that department, whereof he is the President. Such a measure is very meritorious, and cannot fail to do him great honor. He is, as you know, 
the brother to the Archbishop. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear General. I hope you think often 
of an adoptive son, who loves you with all the powers 
</p><p>
of his heart ; and, as long as it has life, will ever be 
</p><p>
Your most grateful, affectionate, respectful friend, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=laf" rel="me">Lafayette</a>.

P. S. My best and tenderest respects wait on 
Mrs. Washington. Remember me most respectfully 
to your mother and relations, particularly to George. 
I pay my compliments to all friends. Adieu, my 
dear General.
