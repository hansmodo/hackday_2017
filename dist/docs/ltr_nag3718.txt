Sir, 
</p><p>
Inclosed, I send your Excellency a copy of my 
letter to Congress, for your information respecting the operations in This department. The Marquis de 
Lafayette has arrived in Virginia ; but I believe his 
troops are still in Mardand. Some days since I sent 
Colonel Morris to confer with the Marquis, and see 
if he has your Excellency's permission to go farther 
southward. I received a letter from him on the 
road, acquainting me that there was an account from 
<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, of Admiral Arbuthnot's arriving in the 
Chesapeake, with six ships of the line and upwards 
of thirty transports, with a considerable reenforcement. If this report is true, our flattering prospects 
are at an end in that quarter. Nothing more can be 
expected than confining the enemy in their fortifications. It would afford me great relief, if the detachment under the Marquis could proceed farther southward. But I fear the state of the Northern army 
will not admit of this, nor am I informed of the latitude your Excellency had given him on that subject. 
The regular troops will be late in the field, if they 
are raised at all. Virginia, from the unequal operation of the law for drafting, is not likely to get 
many soldiers. Maryland, as late as the loth of this 
month, had not got a man ; nor is there a man raised 
in North Carolina, or the least prospect of it. In 
this situation, remote from reenforcements, inferior to 
the enemy in numbers, and no prospect of support, I 
am at a loss what is best to be done. If the enemy 
falls down towards Wilmington, they will be in a 
position where it would be impossible for us to injure 
them, if we had a force. In this critical and distressing situation, I am determined to carry the war immediately into South Carolina. The enemy will be obliged to follow us, or give up their posts in that State. 
If the former takes place, it will draw the war out 
of this State, and give it an opportunity to raise its proportion of men. If they leave their posts to fall, 
they must lose more there than they can gain here. 
If we continue in this State, the enemy will hold 
their possessions in both. All things considered, I 
think the movement is warranted by the soundest 
reasons, both political and military. The manoeuvre 
will be critical and dangerous, and the troops exposed to every hardship. But, as I share it with 
them, I hope they will bear up under it with that 
magnanimity which has already supported them, and 
for which they deserve every thing of their country. 
I expect to be ready to march in about five days, 
and have written to General Sumpter to collect the 
militia to aid the operations. I am persuaded the 
movement will be unexpected to the enemy, and I 
intend it shall be as little known as possible. Our 
baggage and stores, not with the army, I shall order 
by the route of Saura Towns and Shallow Ford, to 
Charlotte. By having them in the upper country, we 
shall always have a safe retreat, and from those inhabitants we may expect the greatest support. I 
shall take every measure to avoid a misfortune. But 
necessity obliges me to commit myself to chance ; 
and, I trust, my friends will do justice to my reputation if any accident attends me. 
</p><p>
I am, with the greatest respect, &c., 
</p><p>

P. S. Inclosed, I send you a general return of 
the army.
