DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The shipping, moving up the river, must fully convince us that 
their intentions are for <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. It is, therefore, a matter of the 
utmost importance for us immediately to fix upon what manner 
we shall dispose of our troops. If we were convinced that <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> was able to oppose them, I think we ought not to lose 
one moment, but march immediately down to King's Bridge. 
</p><p>
I wrote <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> on Sunday, and begged of him to ac 
quaint me with his situation. Would it not, therefore, be prudent 
to keep our troops at <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a> until I receive his answer? Your immediate opinion will oblige, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your very humble servant, 
</p><p>
