Sir: Since writing to you by Lieutenant Revere a force of seventy Californians, moving from Santa Clara towards Sonoma, after passing the narrows of this bay twelve miles to the 
Northerd of my anchorage, were met by a party of fifteen of the revolutionists, and checked or, as reported, compelled to fall back with the loss of two killed and two wounded, two of the 
fifteen also falling by the fire of their opponents. This first success, though seemingly a small 
affair, cannot fail I think to give a favorable impulse to the operations of the insurgents and attract at once numbers of the foreign residents to their aid. Although neutral in my position, I 
cannot be so in feeling and am anxiously looking for farther intelligence, believing that inactivity in the circumstances can form no part of the policy of the Sonoma party.

<a href="/results.php?tla=jsc" rel="adversary">Castro</a> has written to me, saying that " he had received advice from various sources, that the boats of the American ship Portsmouth go about the Bay of San Francisco armed for the 
purpose of examining its trade, etc." This, of course, I have very honestly denied, but informed him that I had sent two boats since the 10th inst. to your camp, and deemed it proper in the 
circumstances to notify him of my intention to despatch another for the purpose of communicating with you at the close of this week, since which I have heard nothing from him. He is at 
Santa Clara with about seventy men, it is said. 
</p><p>
I have directed Lieutenant Bartlett to bring Surgeon Henderson with him when he returns, unless your detention beyond the period named for your final departure for the United States 
should render his further continuance important, of which you will please be the judge. Lieutenant Bartlett will hand you, sir, a package for the Honorable Secretary of the Navy, which (if 
perfectly convenient, not otherwise), I will thank you to take charge of, and forward from any point of communication most convenient to yourself. 
</p><p>
Wishing you, sir, a safe and pleasant journey to your country and home, I have the honor to subscribe myself, 
</p><p>
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
(Signed) <a href="/results.php?tla=jbm" rel="me">Jno. B. Montgomery</a>,
