Sir, 
</p><p>
I have examined all <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a>'s ministerial correspondence ; and, after the impression which I had received from others, whom I supposed to be conversant 
with it, I am really astonished to find so little of what is exceptionable, and so much of what the most 
violent would call patriotic. The parts to be withheld, will probably be of these denominations ; â€” 1, what the conduct of the rulers in France, which, if returned to that country, might expose him to danger ; 3, 
the authors of some interesting information, who, if known, would be infallibly denounced. He speaks 
indeed of his Court, a phrase which he might as well have let alone. I shall do myself the honor of waiting on you in the morning ; and I write now, only to 
give you an outline of the true state of the business. I have the honor. Sir, to be, with the highest respect.
</p><p> 
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
