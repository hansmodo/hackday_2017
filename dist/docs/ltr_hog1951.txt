I sincerely wish you Joy of being Appointed a Brigadier General and of the Good News received Yesterday from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="colleague">Doctor Franklyn</a>, who 
writes from France the begining of December last, & Says a General War in Europe is upon the Point of being Declared I have been Labouring to procure You some Respite from the Toils you have undergone, and once more a happy meeting with Mr. Wayne, the Congress have 
at length Resolved that One Major General be immediately sent to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>, Two Brigadiers General to Tyonderoga, One to Benington &

Colonel Wood acquaints me, that Major, now 
Lieut: Col: Hay, has not expended any of the 5000 Dollars I left in his Hands, in the necessary Use, & Services of the Garrison, for which, it 
was solely intended ; I desire you will in my Name Demand, not only the reason why my Orders were not complyed with, but an Accompt 
how that Particular Sum was disposed of. 
</p><p>
The Enemy have hitherto made a miserable hand of it in the Jerseys, by Killed, taken, Desertion, & Death, they must have lost 3000 
Men at least This City seems Quieted from its Fears, as it is Generaly believed, it is now impracticable for British Army to make its way 
here Various are the Reports of the part to be Acted upon both Sides the ensuing Campaign, nay, it is even immagined by some, that the 
whole British Force is going to Virginia, this, I will only believe when I see it, why they should depart from their Original plan I cannot conceive, 
depend upon it when they do, their Ruin will only be the more speedy Certain. 
</p><p>
You would Frequently have heard from me had I been certain of a safe conveyance to your 
Hands. This goes with the Congress Packet, which the Messenger is Ordered to deliver him self Messengers of Congress are at length to be 
establishd from this City to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tyconderoga" rel="city">Tyconderoga</a>, and this is not the Only change you will see, that I am satisfied you will not disapprove 
</p><p>
