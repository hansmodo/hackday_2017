GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
I have received your favour of the 27th of February, 
with the Journal of the House of Representatives, and copies 
of the late oppressive prosecutions in the Admiralty Court, 
which I shall, as you direct, communicate to Mr. Bollan, 
and consult with him on the most advantageous use to be 
made of them for the interest of the province. 
</p><p>
I think one may clearly see, in the system of customs to 
be exacted in America by act of Parliament, the seeds sown 
of a total disunion of the two countries, though, as yet, that 
event may be at a considerable distance. \\ The course and natural progress seems to be, first, the appointment of needy 
men as officers, for others do not care to leave England; 
then, their necessities make them rapacious, their office makes 
them proud and insolent, their insolence and rapacity make 
them odious, and, being conscious that they are hated, they 
become malicious; their malice urges them to a continual 
abuse of the inhabitants in their letters to administration, 
representing them as disaffected and rebellious, and (to 
encourage the use of severity) as weak, divided, timid, and 
cowardly. Government believes all; thinks it necessary 
to support and countenance its officers; their quarrelling 
with the people is deemed a mark and consequence of their 
fidelity; they are therefore more highly rewarded, and this 
makes their conduct still more insolent and provoking. 
</p><p>
The resentment of the people will, at times and on particular incidents, burst into outrages and violence upon such 
officers, and this naturally draws down severity and acts of 
further oppression from hence. The more the people are dissatisfied, the more rigor will be thought necessary; severe 
punishments will be inflicted to terrify ; rights and privileges 
will be abolished ; greater force will then be required to secure 
execution and submission; the expense will become enormous; it will then be thought proper, by fresh exactions, 
to make the people defray it ; thence, the British nation and 
government will become odious, the subjection to it will 
be deemed no longer tolerable; war ensues, and the bloody 
struggle will end in absolute slavery to America, or ruin to 
Britain by the loss of her colonies ; the latter most probable, 
from America's growing strength and magnitude. 
</p><p>
But, as the whole empire must, in either case, be greatly 
weakened, I cannot but wish to see much patience and the 
utmost discretion in our general conduct, that the fatal period 
may be postponed, and that, whenever this catastrophe shall 
happen, it may appear to all mankind, that the fault has not 
been ours. And, since the collection of these duties has 
already cost Britain infinitely more, in the loss of commerce, 
than they amount to, and that loss is likely to continue and 
increase by the encouragement given to our manufactures 
through resentment; and since the best pretence for establishing and enforcing the duties is the regulation of trade for 
the general advantage, it seems to me, that it would be much 
better for Britain to give them up, on condition of the colonies undertaking to enforce and collect such, as are thought 
fit to be continued, by laws of their own, and officers of their 
own appointment, for the public uses of their respective 
governments. This would alone destroy those seeds of disunion, and both countries might thence much longer continue 
to grow great together, more secure by their united strength, 
and more formidable to their common enemies. But the 
power of appointing friends and dependents to profitable 
offices is too pleasing to most administrations, to be easily 
parted with or lessened; and therefore such a proposition 
if it were made, is not very likely to meet with attention. 
</p><p>
I do not pretend to the gift of prophecy. History shows, 
that, by these steps, great empires have crumbled heretofore ; 
and the late transactions we have so much cause to complain 
of show, that we are in the same train, and that, without a 
greater share of prudence and wisdom, than we have seen 
both sides to be possessed of, we shall probably come to the 
same conclusion. 
</p><p>
The Parliament, however, is prorogued, without having 
taken any of the steps we had been threatened with, relating 
to our charter. Their attention has been engrossed by other 
affairs, and we have therefore longer time to operate in making such impressions, as may prevent a renewal of this particular attempt by our adversaries. With great esteem and 
respect, I have the honour to be, &c. B FRANKLIN.
