I understand, my dear friend, that you did not receive any letter from Payne by 
the last arrivals. I will communicate to you with pleasure what Mr. Gallatin says 
of him. He says Todd and Millegan left St. Petersburg before them, and took the 
Sweden route ; found the coast frozen, and after a long detention came by way of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=copenhagen" rel="city">Copenhagen</a>, and joined them at Amsterdam 
the day before they left it ; that Payne had gone on a visit to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, and was to 
return to Mr. Gallatin in three weeks ; he set off the 7th of May from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>. He will have a very pleasant jaunt, no doubt, 
and Dallas expected to follow him. Millegan was gone on a message to Gottenburgh. I dare not write you a long letter 
for fear of being too late for the mail, and I wish you to get the information as soon 
as possible, for I know you must be anxious. Remember me to your sister, and believe me your very sincere friend,
