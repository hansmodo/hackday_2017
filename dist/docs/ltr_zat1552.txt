My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your very acceptable & interesting letter of the I st ins reached me 
on the evening of the 5th the day after we left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Comargo" rel="city">Comargo</a> for this place, 
where I arrived yesterday & joined the advance under Gen Worth, find 
ing all well ; without meeting with any occurrence on the way worthy of 
notice. All the regular troops are now here, & I look for one Briggade 
of Volunteers today, & the other tomorrow, which will be all the troops 
here that are to move on this route ; two Rgt s of Texas mounted men 
are or have been ordered on a road running parallel to the one we are on 
to our left, under Gov r Henderson to unite with us some fifty miles in 
advance of this place, should they not disband, of which there was some 
apprehension when we left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Comargo" rel="city">Comargo</a>, & it is quite likely a portion of 
them will do so ; in which case I cannot say the am 1 of force we shall 
have when the whole are concentrated, but not far short of six thousand, 
about 3200 of which will be regulars. Whether the enemy will fight for 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> is quite uncertain, it can only be ascertained by going there ; 
my impressions are we shall meet with no resistance out of the city, they 
may attempt to defend it, which I hope will be the case, as they have 
thrown up some slight defences for its protection ; as I hope to be able 
to reduce it, in which case I hope to capture their army, as well as take 
their artillery & military stores if they have any ; we shall however see 
all about it when we get there There is no doubt but what Santa 
Anna 1 has returned to Mexico, & been installed as dictator for four 
months ; how all this is to eventuate as to the relations between the two 
countries time must determine ; report says he is moving rapidly towards 
this frontier at the head of a large force ; if this be true there is but little 
prospect of anything like an amicable accommodation of existing difficul 
ties between the two countries. It is stated in the papers, also in letters 
to & from officers of the army, that the 2 d Infy or the nine comp s at N. 
York & New Port Kentucky, had been halted by directions from Wash 
ington until further orders ; the reason for which is not stated, so I need 
not expect their aid at any rate for a time at least. 
</p><p>
I shall be detained here principally to have the horses & mules shod, 
as it is impossible for either that are worked in harness or under the 
saddle to get along without, the greater part of the road being over sharp 
stones at best difficult to travel over. I expect to leave with the first 
division on Sunday morning the 13th  to be followed by the other two the 
next two days, & after concentrating twenty-five miles this side <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>, to reach there about the 2O th or 22 d As regards Rob, there is no 
doubt he has natural capacity enough for any situation, but there is more 
in application in reaching the prominent stations in our country than in 
anything else ; I have experienced enough as well in my own family as in 
others that it was as well if not better to make no very great calculations 
as regards the prominent positions our children are to occupy, as there 
are so many contingencies connected with the same, they are but rarely 
realized. Appointments in our army & navy are given now to particular 
families or to the friends of active politicians ; so that you ought to 
make no calculations on anything of the kind for your boys with any 
thing like a certainty of success. Let the application for a midshipman s 
warrant or an appointment at West Point be made at the proper time, 
backed by the best influence that can be brought to bear on the case, & 
if it is not successful they must try some other pursuit, which may be 
made as respectable & more lucrative as any the gov can give. Finlay, 
McLaren & Turner 1 have been ordered here. Should they come Craig 
who is completly broken down will go out or home if he has any, as 
soon as Finlay arrives who ranks him, on sick leave if able to do so ; his 
position as medical director being the only thing I presume which keeps 
him here ; when they all get here, Wells I presume will as a matter of 
course expect to go out. The individuals in question will I presume all 
come out with great reluctance. It is stated here, I do not know on 
what authority, that Finlay will protest against the order, which I apprehend will do him but little good particularly as I do not know what right 
he has to claim an exemption from this or any other service

Col Taylor is still absent, when he left us at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Comargo" rel="city">Comargo</a> he expected to 
join before we got to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>, this I think doubtful The country 
we are now in alth for the most part poor is decidedly of more interest 
than any we have heretofore passed over ; we are now in sight of high 
mountains, amidst large brooks of clear cool water running in torrents 
from them, as well as among springs of running water as pure as it can 
well be ; my tent is near several which affords water enough to supply 
the city of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">New York</a>

I rec d a letter from Betty who with her mother & Dick was at East 
Pascagoula where they would pass a few weeks, as they were pleasantly 
situated with fine sea bathing with pleasant company &c & then return 
to their homes or to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> ; Betty & her mother were as well as 
usual, & Dick alth much better was suffering with rheumatism which it 
was hoped he would be relieved from by sea bathing.- My love to Ann 
& the children when you write & accept my best wishes for the continued health & prosperity of you & yours through life.
