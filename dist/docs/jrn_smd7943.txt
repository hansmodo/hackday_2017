Having nothing to do, I may as well go on with the history of our wanderings. When the cars were moving off with the handsome Mr. Howard, mother 
turned to a gentleman who seemed to own the place, and asked to be shown the hotel. He went out, and presently returning with a chair and two negroes, 
quietly said he would take us to his own house; the hotel was not comfortable. And, without listening to remonstrances, led the way to a beautiful little 
cottage, where he introduced his wife, Mrs. Gate, who received us most charmingly, and had me in bed before five minutes had elapsed. I don't know how 
any one can believe the whole world so wicked ; for my part I have met none but the kindest people imaginable; I don't know any wicked ones. 
</p><p>
Before half an hour had passed, a visitor was announced ; so I gathered up my weary bones, and with scarcely a peep at the glass, walked to the parlor. I 
commenced laughing before I got there, and the visitor smiled most absurdly, too; for it was Mr. Halsey! It seemed so queer to meet in this part of the 
world that we laughed again after shaking hands. It was odd. I was thinking how much amused the 
General would be to hear of it ; for he had made a bet that we would meet when I asserted that we would not. 
</p><p>
After the first few remarks, he told me of how he 
had heard of our arrival. A gentleman had walked 
into camp, asking if a Mr. Halsey was there. He 
signified that he was the gentleman, whereupon the 
other drew out my note, saying a young lady on the 
cars had requested him to deliver it. Instantly 
recognizing the chirography, he asked where I was. 
"Hammond. This is her name," replied the other, 
extending to him my card. Thinking, as he modestly 
confessed, that I had intended it only for him, Mr. Halsey coolly put it into his pocket, and called for 
his horse. Mr. Howard lingered still, apparently 
having something to say, which he found difficult to 
put in words. At last, as the other prepared to 
ride off, with a tremendous effort he managed to say, 
"The young lady's card is mine. If it is all the same 
to you, I should like to have it returned." Apologizing for the mistake, Mr. Halsey returned it, feeling 
rather foolish, I should imagine, and rode on to the 
village, leaving, as he avers, Mr. Howard looking 
enviously after the lucky dog who was going to see 
such a young lady. 
</p><p>
He told me something that slightly disgusted me 
with Captain Bradford. It was that when he reached 
the bivouac the next morning after leaving <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a>, 
the Captain had put him under arrest for having 
stayed there all night. It was too mean, considering 
that it is more than probable that he himself remained at Mrs. Fluker's. We discovered, too, that 
we had missed two letters Mr. Halsey had written 
us, which, of course, is a great disappointment. One, 
written to both, the other, a short note of ten pages, 
for me, which I am sure was worth reading. 
</p><p>
It was not until after sunset that we exhausted all 
topics of conversation, and Mr. Halsey took his 
leave, promising to see us in the morning. 
</p><p>
And, to be sure, as soon as I was dressed on Satur 
day, he again made his appearance, followed soon 
after by the carriage. Taking a cordial leave of Mrs. Cate, with many thanks for her hospitality, we 
entered our conveyance, and with Mr. Halsey riding 
by the side of the carriage, went on our way. He was 
to accompany us only as far as Ponchatoula some 
six miles; but the turning-point in his journey seemed 
to be an undetermined spot; for mile after mile rolled 
away rather the wheels rolled over them and 
still he rode by us, talking through the window, and 
the sprays of wild flowers he would pick for me from 
time to time were growing to quite a bouquet, when 
he proposed an exchange with the farmer who was 
driving us, and, giving him his horse, took the reins 
himself. 
</p><p>
I think Miriam and I will always remember that ride. The laughter, the conversation, the songs with 
the murmuring accompaniment of the wheels, and a thousand incidents pleasant to remember though 
foolish to speak of, will always form a delightful tableau in our recollections. I have but one disagree 
able impression to remember in connection with the trip, and that occurred at a farmhouse two miles from 
here, where we stopped to get strawberries. I preferred remaining in the carriage, to the trouble of 
getting out; so all went in, Mr. Halsey dividing his time equally between Miriam in the house and me in 
the carriage, supplying me with violets and pensSes one moment, and the next showing me the most 
tempting strawberries at the most provoking distance, assuring me they were exquisite. The individual to whom the carriage belonged, who had given 
up the reins to Mr. Halsey, and who, no doubt, was respectable enough for his class in his part of the 
country, would allow no one to bring me my strawberries, reserving the honor for himself. Presently he 
appeared with a large saucer of them covered with 
cream. I was naturally thankful, but would have preferred his returning to the house after he had fulfilled 
his mission. Instead, he had the audacity to express his admiration of my personal appearance; with 
out a pause gave me a short sketch of his history, informed me he was a widower, and very anxious to 
marry again, and finally, Lares and Penates of the house of Morgan ap Kerrig, veil your affronted 
brows ! You will scarcely credit that the creature had the insolence to say that he would marry me to 
morrow, if he could, and think himself blessed; for the jewel of the soul must be equal to the casket that 
contained it! Yes! this brute of a man had the unparalleled audacity to speak to me in such a way ! 
Just then, mother, remembering her invalid, came to the gallery and asked how I was enjoying my 
lunch. " I'm courting her ! " cried the wretch. " Glad she did not go in ! Swear she's the prettiest girl I ever 
saw ! " At that moment Mr. Halsey came sauntering out with a handful of violets for me, and, turning my 
shoulder to the creature, I entered into a lively discussion with him, and at last had the satisfaction of 
seeing the wretch enter the house. 
</p><p>
A drive through the straggling, half -deserted town brought us here to Mrs. Greyson's, a large, old-fashioned-looking house so close to the Tchefuncta (I think that is the name of the river) that I could throw a stone in it from my bed, almost. 
Mrs. Greyson herself would require two or three 
pages to do her justice. Fancy the daughter of Sir Francis Searle, the widow of General Greyson, the 
belle of <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> in her young days, settled 
down into a hotel-keeper on a small scale, with stately 
ladies and gentlemen looking down in solemn surprise at her boarders from their rich portrait frames on the parlor wall! Fallen greatness always gives 
me an uncomfortable thrill. Yet here was the heiress 
of these shadows on the wall, gay, talkative, bustling, active; with a word of caution, or a word of 
advice to all; polite, attentive, agreeable to her guests, quarreling and exacting with her servants, 
grasping and avaricious with all; singing a piece from " Norma " in a voice, about the size of a thread 
No. 150, that showed traces of former excellence; or cheapening a bushel of corn meal with equal volubility. What a character! Full of little secrets and mysteries. " Now, my dear, I don't ask you to tell a 
story, you know; but if the others ask you if you knew it, just look surprised and say, Oh, dear me, 
when did it happen? Cause I promised not to tell; only you are such favorites that I could not help it, 
and it would not do to acknowledge it. And if any one asks you if I put these candles in here, just say you 
brought them with you, that's a love, because they will be jealous, as I only allow them lamps." Eccentric Mrs. Greyson ! Many an hour's amusement did 
she afford me.
</p><p>
A ride of twenty-six miles bolt upright in the carriage, over such bad roads, had almost used me up ; 
I retired to bed in a state of collapse, leaving Miriam 
to entertain Mr. Halsey alone. After supper, though, 
I managed to put on my prettiest dress, and be carried down to the parlor where I rejoined the rest. 
Several strange ladies were present, one of whom has 
since afforded me a hearty laugh. She was a horrid-looking woman, and ten minutes after I entered, 
crossing the room with a most laughable look of vulgarity attempting to ape righteous scorn, jerked 
some articles of personal property from the table and 
retired with the sweep of a small hurricane. I thought 
her an eccentric female; but what was my amazement yesterday to hear that she sought Mrs. Greyson, told her it was impossible for her to stay among 
so many elegantly dressed ladies, and that she preferred keeping her room. Next day, she told her that 
she was entirely too attentive to us, and rather than 
be neglected in that way for other people, would 
leave the house, which she did instantly.

There was a singular assembly of odd characters in the parlor Saturday night, six of whom looked as 
though they were but so many reflections of the same 
individual in different glasses, and the seventh differed from the rest only in playing exquisitely on the 
banjo "Too well to be a gentleman," I fear. 
These were soldiers, come to "call" on us. Half an hour after we arrived, a dozen of them took posses 
sion of the bench on the bank of the river, one with 
his banjo who played and sang delightfully. Old Mrs. Greyson, who is rather eccentric, called, "Ah, Mr. J ! Have you heard already of the arrival of the 
young ladies? You never serenaded <em>me!</em>" The young man naturally looked foolish; so she went out and 
asked him to come around after dark and play for 
the young ladies. So after a while he came, "bringing six devils yet worse than himself," as the old 
Scriptural phrase has it, all of whom sat on the same side of the room, and looked at us steadily when they 
thought we were not looking. All had the same voice, the same bow, the same manner that is to say 
none at all of the latter ; one introduced an agreeable variety, saying as he bowed to each separately, 
"Happy to make your acquaintance, ma am." Mr. Halsey just managed to keep his face straight, while 
I longed for a Dickens to put them all together and make one amusing picture out of the seven. I 
troubled myself very little about them, preferring Mr. Halsey's company, not knowing when we would 
meet again. It would not have been quite fair to 
leave him to himself after he had ridden such a distance for us ; so I generously left the seven to Miriam, 
content with one, and rather think I had the best of the bargain. The one with the banjo suggested 
that we should sing for them before he played for us, so Miriam played on the piano, and sang with me on 
the guitar half a dozen songs, and then the other commenced. I don't know when I have been more 
amused. There was an odd, piney- woods dash about him that was exceedingly diverting, and he went through comic, sentimental, and original songs with 
an air that showed his whole heart was in it. Judging from the number of youth too timid to venture in, who peeped at us from the windows, I should say 
that young ladies are curiosities just now in <a href='/results.php?city=madisonville' rel='city'>Madisonville</a>.
