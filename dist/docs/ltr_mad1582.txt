</p><p>
DEAR SIR, My two last, though written for the two last 
packets, have unluckily been delayed till this conveyance. The 
first of them was sent from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> to Commodore Jones, 
in consequence of information that he was certainly to go by 
the packet then about to sail. Being detained here by his business with Congress, and being unwilling to put the letter into 
the mail without my approbation, which could not be obtained 
in time, he detained the letter also. The second was sent from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> to Col. Carrington, with a view that it might go 
by the last packet, at all events, in case Commodore Jones 
should meet with further detention here. By ill luck he was 
out of Town, and did not return till it was too late to make use 
of the opportunity. Neither of thewere, indeed, of much 
consequence at the time, and are still less so now. I let them 
go forward, nevertheless, as they may mention some circumstances not at present in my recollection, and as they will prevent a chasm in my part of a correspondence which I have so 
many motives to cherish by an exact punctuality. 
</p><p>
You will herewith receive the result of the Convention, which 
continued its session till the 17th of September. I take the liberty of making some observ.ions on the subject, which will 
help to make up a letter, if they should answer no other purpose. 
</p><p>
It appeared to be the sincere and unanimous wish of the Convention to cherish and preserv.the Union of the States. No 
proposition was made, no suggestion was thrown out, in favor 
of a partition of the Empire into two or more Confederacies. 
</p><p>
It was generally agreed that the objects of the Union could 
not be secured by any system founded on the principle of a confederation of Sovereign States. A voluntary observ.ce of the 
federal law by all the members could never be hoped for. A 
compulsive one could evidently never be reduced to practice, 
and if it could, involved equal calamities to the innocent and 
the guilty, the necessity of a military force, both obnoxious and 
dangerous, and, in general, a scene resembling much more a civil 
war than the administration of a regular Government. 
</p><p>
Hence was embraced the alternative of a Government which, 
instead of operating on the States, should operate without their 
intervention on the individuals composing them; and hence the 
change in the principle and proportion of representation. 
</p><p>
This ground-work being laid, the great objects which presented themselves were: 1. To unite a proper energy in the Executive, and a proper stability in the Legislative departments, 
with the essential characters of Republican Government. 2. 
To draw a line of demarkation which would give to the General Government every power requisite for general purposes, 
and leave to the States every power which might be most beneficially administered by them. 3. To provide for the different 
interests of different parts of the Union, 4. To adjust the clashing pretensions of the large and small States. Each of these 
objects was pregnant with difficulties. The whole of them together formed a task more difficult than can be well conceived 
by those who were not concerned in the execution of it. Adding to these considerations the natural diversity of human opinions on all new and complicated subjects, it is impossible to 
consider the degree of concord which ultimately prevailed as 
less than a miracle. 
The first of these objects, as respects the Executive, was peculiarly embarrassing. On the question whether it should consist 
of a single person or a plurality, of co-ordinate members, on the 
mode of appointment, on the duration in office, on the degree of 
power, on the re-eligibility, tedious and reiterated discussions 
took place. The plurality of co-ordinate members had finally 
but few advocates. Governor Randolph was at the head of 
them. The modes of appointment proposed were various: as 
by the people at large, by electors chosen by the people, by the 
Executives of the States, by the Congress; some preferring a 
joint ballot of the two Houses; some, a separate concurrent ballot, allowing to each a negative on the other house; some, a 
nomination of several candidates by one House, out of whom a 
choice should be made by the other. Several other modifications were started. The expedient at length adopted seemed 
to give pretty general satisfaction to the members. As to the 
duration in office, a few would have preferred a tenure during 
good behaviour; a considerable number would have done so in 
case an easy and effectual removal by impeachment could be 
settled. 
</p><p>
It was much agitated whether a long term, seven years for 
example, with a subsequent and perpetual ineligibility, or a short 
term, with a capacity to be re-elected, should be fixed. In favor 
of the first opinion were urged the danger of a gradual degeneracy of re-elections from time to time, into first a life and then 
a hereditary tenure, and the favorable effect of an incapacity to 
be reappointed on the independent exercise of the Executive 
authority. On the other side it was contended that the prospect of necessary degradation would discourage the most dignified characters from aspiring to the ofBce ; would take away 
the principal motive to the faithful discharge of its duties the 
hope of being rewarded with a reappointment ; would stimulate 
ambition to violent efforts for holding over the Constitutional 
term; and instead of producing an independent administration 
and a firmer defence of the constitutional rights of the department, would render the officer more indifferent to the importance of a place which he would soon be obliged to quit forever, 
and more ready to yield to the encroachments of the Legislature, of which he might again be a member. 
</p><p>
The questions concerning the degree of power turned chiefly 
on the appointment to offices, and the controul on the Legislature. An absolute appointment to all offices, to some offices, to 
no offices, formed the scale of opinions on the first point. On 
the second, some contended for an absolute negative, as the only 
possible mean of reducing to practice the theory of a free Government, which forbids a mixture of the Legislative and Executive powers. Others would be content with a revisionary 
power, to be overruled by three-fourths of both Houses. It was 
warmly urged that the judiciary department should be associated in the revision. The idea of some was, that a separate 
revision should be given to the two departments; that if either 
objected, two-thirds, if both, three-fourths, should be necessary 
to overrule. 
</p><p>
In forming the Senate, the great anchor of the government, 
the questions, as they come within the first object, turned mostly 
on the mode of appointment, and the duration of it. The different modes proposed were: 1. By the House of Representatives. 
2. By the Executive. 3. By electors chosen by the people for 
the purpose. 4. By the State Legislatures. On the point of 
duration, the propositions descended from good behaviour to 
four years, through the intermediate terms of nine, seven, six, 
and five years. The election of the other branch was first determined to be triennial, and afterwards reduced to biennial. 
</p><p>
The second object, the due partition of power between the 
General and local Governments, was perhaps, of all, the most 
nice and difficult. A few contended for an entire abolition of 
the States; some, for indefinite power of Legislation in the 
Congress, with a negative on the laws of the States: some, for 
such a power without a negative; some, for a limited power of 
legislation, with such a negative; the majority, finally, for a 
limited power without the negative. The question with regard 
to the negative underwent repeated discussions, and was finally 
rejected by a bare majority. As I formerly intimated to you 
my opinion in favor of this ingredient, I will take this occasion 
of explaining myself on the subject. Such a check on the 
States appears to me necessary 1. To prevent encroachments 
on the General authority. 2. To prevent instability and injustice in the legislation of the States. 
</p><p>
1. Without such a check in the whole over the parts, our 
system involves the evil of imperia in imperio. If a compleat 
supremacy somewhere is not necessary in every society, a controuling power at least is so, by which the general authority 
may be defended against encroachments of the subordinate 
authorities, and by which the latter may be restrained from 
encroachments on each other. If the supremacy of the British 
Parliament is not necessary, as has been contended, for the 
harmony of that Empire, it is evident, I think, that without tJie 
royal negative, or some equivalent controul, the unity of the system 
would be destroyed. The want of some such provision seems 
to have been mortal to the antient confederacies, and to be the 
disease of the modern. Of the Lycian confederacy little is 
known. That of the Amphictyons is well known to have been 
rendered of little use whilst it lasted, and, in the end, to have been 
destroyed by the predominance of the local over the federal 
authority. The same observ.ion may be made, on the authority of Polybius, with regard to the Achasan League. The 
Helvetic System scarcely amounts to a confederacy, and is distinguished by too many peculiarities to be a ground of comparison. 
</p><p>
The case of the United Netherlands is in point. The authority of a Statdholder, the influence of a standing Army, the 
common interest in the conquered possessions, the pressure of 
surrounding danger, the guarantee of foreign powers, are not 
sufficient to secure the authority and interest of the generality 
against the anti-federal tendency of the provincial sovereignties. 
The German Empire is another example. A Hereditary chief, 
with vast independent resources of wealth and power, a federal 
Diet, with ample parchment authority, a regular Judiciary 
establishment, the influence of the neighbourhood of great and 
formidable nations, have been found unable either to maintain 
the subordination of the members, or to prevent their mutual 
contests and encroachments. Still more to the purpose is our 
own experience, both during the war and since the peace. Encroachments of the States on the general authority, sacrifices 
of national to local interests, interferences of the measures of 
different States, form a great part of the history of our political 
system. 
</p><p>
It may be said that the new Constitution is founded on 
different principles, and will have a different operation. I 
admit the difference to be material. It presents the aspect 
rather of a feudal system of republics, if such a phrase may be 
used, than of a Confederacy of independent States. And what 
has been the progress and event of the feudal Constitutions ? 
In all of them a continual struggle between the head and the 
inferior members, until a final victory has been gained, in some 
instances by one, in others, by the other of them. In one 
respect, indeed, there is a remarkable variance between the two 
cases. In the feudal system, the sovereign, though limited, was 
independent; and having no particular sympathy of interests 
with the great Barons, his ambition had as full play as theirs 
in the mutual projects of usurpation. In the American Constitution, the general authority will be derived entirely from the 
subordinate authorities. The Senate will represent the States 
in their political capacity; the other House will represent the 
people of the States in their individual capacity. The former 
will be accountable to their constituents at moderate, the latter 
at short periods. The President also derives his appointment 
from the States, and is periodically accountable to them. This 
dependence of the General on the local authorities seems effectually to guard the latter against any dangerous encroachments 
of the former; whilst the latter, within their respective limits, 
will be continually sensible of the abridgement of their power, 
and be stimulated by ambition to resume the surrendered portion of it. 
</p><p>
We find the representatives of Counties and Corporations in 
the Legislatures of the States much more disposed to sacrifice 
the aggregate interest, and even authority, to the local views of 
their constituents, than the latter to the former. I mean not by 
these remarks to insinuate that an esprit de corps will not exist in the National Government, or that opportunities may not 
occur of extending its jurisdiction in some points. I mean only 
that the danger of encroachments is much greater from the 
other side, and that the impossibility of dividing powers of 
legislation in such a manner as to be free from different constructions by different interests, or even from ambiguity in the 
judgment of the impartial, requires some such expedient as I 
contend for. Many illustrations might be given of this impossibility. How long has it taken to fix, and how imperfectly is 
yet fixed, the legislative power of corporations, though that 
power is subordinate in the most compleat manner? The line 
of distinction between the power of regulating trade and that 
of drawing revenue from it, which was once considered the barrier of our liberties, was found, on fair discussion, to be absolutely undefinable. No distinction seems to be more obvious 
than that between spiritual and temporal matters. Yet, wherever they have been made objects of Legislation, they have 
clashed and contended with each other, till one or the other has 
gained the supremacy. Even the boundaries between the Executive, Legislative, and judiciary powers, though in general so 
strongly marked in themselves, consist, in many instances, of 
mere shades of difference. 
</p><p>
It may be said that the Judicial authority, under our new system, will keep the States within their proper limits, and supply 
the place of a negative on their laws. The answer is, that it is 
more convenient to prevent the passage of a law than to declare 
it void after it is passed; that this will be particularly the case 
where the law aggrieves individuals, who may be unable to 
support an appeal against a State to the Supreme Judiciary; 
that a State which would violate the Legislative rights of the 
Union would not be very ready to obey a Judicial decree in 
support of them; and that a recurrence to force, which, in the 
event of disobedience, would be necessary, is an evil which the 
new Constitution meant to exclude as far as possible. 
</p><p>
2. A Constitutional negative on the laws of the States seems 
equally necessary to secure individuals against encroachments 
</p><p>
on their rights. The mutability of the laws of the States is 
found to be a serv.us evij. The injustice of them has been so 
frequent and so flagrant as to alarm the most stedfast friends 
of Republicanism. I am persuaded I do not err in saying that 
the evils issuing from these sources contributed more to that 
uneasiness which produced the Convention, and prepared the 
public mind for a general reform, than those which accrued to 
our national character and interest from the inadequacy of the 
Confederation to its immediate objects. A reform, therefore, 
which does not make provision for private rights, must be materially defective. The restraints against paper emissions and 
violations of contracts are not sufficient. Supposing them to be 
effectual as far as they go, they are short of the mark. Injustice may be effected by such an infinitude of legislative expedients, that where the disposition exists, it can only be controuled 
by some provision which reaches all cases whatsoever. The 
partial provision made supposes the disposition which will 
evade it. 
</p><p>
It may be asked how private rights will be more secure under 
the Guardianship of the General Government than under the 
State Governments, since they are both founded on the republican principle which refers the ultimate decision to the will of 
the majority, and are distinguished rather by the extent within 
which they will operate, than by any material difference in their 
structure. A full discussion of this question would, if I mistake 
not, unfold the true principles of Republican Government, and 
prove, in contradiction to the concurrent opinions of the theoretical writers, that this form of Government, in order to effect 
its purposes, must operate not within a small but an extensive 
sphere. I will state some of the ideas which have occurred to 
me on this subject. 
</p><p>
Those who contend for a simple democracy, or a pure republic, actuated by the sense of the majority, and operating within 
narrow limits, assume or suppose a case which is altogether 
fictitious. They found their reasoning on the idea that the 
people composing the Society enjoy not only an equality of political rights, but that they have all precisely the same interests and the same feelings in every respect. Were this in reality the case, their reasoning would be conclusive. The interest of the majority would be that of the minority also; the decisions could only turn on mere opinion concerning the good of 
the whole, of which the major voice would be the safest criterion; 
and within a small sphere, this voice could be most easily collected, and the public affairs most accurately managed. 
</p><p>
We know, however, that no society ever did, or can, consist 
of so homogeneous a mass of Citizens. In the Savage state, indeed, an approach is made towards it, but in that state little or 
no Government is necessary. In all civilized societies, distinctions are various and unavoidable. A distinction of property 
results from that very protection which a free Government 
gives to unequal faculties of acquiring it. There will be rich 
and poor; creditors and debtors; a landed interest, a monied 
interest, a mercantile interest, a manufacturing interest. These 
classes may again be subdivided according to the different productions of different situations and soils, and according to different branches of commerce and of manufactures. In addition 
to these natural distinctions, artificial ones will be founded on 
accidental differences in political, religious, or other opinions, 
or an attachment to the persons of leading individuals. However erroneous or ridiculous these grounds of dissention and 
faction may appear to the enlightened Statesman or the benevolent philosopher, the bulk of mankind, who are neither Statesmen nor philosophers, will continue to view them in a different 
light. 
</p><p>
It remains, then, to be enquired, whether a majority having 
any common interest, or feeling any common passion, will find 
sufficient motives to restrain them from oppressing the minority. 
An individual is never allowed to be a judge, or even a witness, 
in his own cause. If two individuals are under the bias of 
interest or enmity against a third, the rights of the latter could 
never be safely referred to the majority of the three. Will two 
thousand individuals be less apt to oppress one thousand, or two 
hundred thousand one hundred thousand ? 
</p><p>
Three motives only can restrain in such cases: 1. A prudent 
regard to private or partial good, as essentially involved in the 
general and permanent good of the whole. This ought, no 
doubt, to be sufficient of itself. Experience, however, shews 
that it has little effect on individuals, and perhaps still less on 
a collection of individuals, and least of all on a majority with 
the public authority in their hands. If the former are ready to 
forget that honesty is the best policy, the last do more. They 
often proceed on the converse of the maxim, that whatever is 
politic is honest. 2. Respect for character. This motive is not 
found sufficient to restrain individuals from injustice, and loses 
its efficacy in proportion to the number winch is to divide the 
pain or the blame. Besides, as it has reference to public opinion, which is that of the majority, the standard is fixed by those 
whose conduct is to be measured by it. 3. Religion. The inefficacy of this restraint on individuals is well known. The 
conduct of every popular assembly, acting on oath, the strongest of religious ties, shews that individuals join without remorse 
in acts against which their consciences would revolt, if proposed 
to them, separately, in their closets. When, indeed, Religion is 
kindled into enthusiasm, its force, like that of other passions, is 
increased by the sympathy of a multitude. But enthusiasm is 
only a temporary state of Religion, and whilst it lasts will 
hardly be seen with pleasure at the helm. Even in its coolest 
state, it has been much oftener a motive to oppression than a 
restraint from it. 
</p><p>
If, then, there must be different interests and parties in 
society, and a majority, when united by a common interest or 
passion, cannot be restrained from oppressing the minority, what 
remedy can be found in a republican Government, where the 
majority must ultimately decide, but that of giving such an 
extent to its sphere, that no common interest or passion will be 
likely to unite a majority of the whole number in an unjust 
pursuit? In a large society, the people are broken into so 
many interests and parties, that a common sentiment is less 
likely to be felt, and the requisite concert less likely to be 
formed, by a majority of the whole. The same security seems 
requisite for the civil as for the religious rights of individuals. 
If the same sect form a majority, and have the power, other 
sects will be sure to be depressed. Divide et impera, the 
reprobated axiom of tyranny, is, under certain qualifications, 
the only policy by which a republic can be administered on just 
principles. 
</p><p>
It must be observ., however, that this doctrine can only 
hold within a sphere of a mean extent. As in too small a 
sphere oppressive combinations may be too easily formed against 
the weaker party, so in too extensive a one a defensive concert 
may be rendered too difficult against the oppression of those 
entrusted with the administration. The great desideratum in 
Government is so to modify the sovereignty as that it may be 
sufficiently neutral between different parts of the society to controul one part from invading the rights of another, and at the 
same time sufficiently controuled itself from setting up an 
interest adverse to that of the entire society. In absolute 
monarchies, the prince may be tolerably neutral towards different classes of his subjects, but may sacrifice the happiness of all 
to his personal ambition or avarice. In small republics, the 
sovereign will is controuled from such a sacrifice of the entire 
society, but is not sufficiently neutral towards the parts composing it. In the extended Republic of the United States, the 
General Government would hold a pretty even balance between 
the parties of particular States, and be at the same time sufficiently restrained, by its dependence on the community, from 
betraying its general interests. 
</p><p>
Begging pardon for this immoderate digression, I return to 
the third object above mentioned, the adjustments of the different interests of different parts of the continent. Some contended for an unlimited power over trade, including exports as 
well as imports, and over slaves as well as other imports; some, 
for such a power, provided the concurrence of two-thirds of both 
Houses were required; some, for such a qualification of the 
power, with an exemption of exports and slaves; others, for an 
exemption of exports only. The result is seen in the Constitution. South Carolina and Georgia were inflexible on the 
point of the Slaves. 
</p><p>
T. 
</p><p>
The remaining object created more embarrassment; and a 
greater alarm for the issue of the Convention, than all the rest 
put together. The little States insisted on retaining their 
equality in both branches, unless a compleat abolition of the 
State Governments should take place; and made an equality in 
the Senate a sine qua non. The large States, on the other hand, 
urged that as the new Government was to be drawn principally 
from the people immediately, and was to operate directly on 
them, not on the States; and, consequently, as the States would 
lose that importance which is now proportioned to the importance of their voluntary compliance with the requisitions of 
Congress, it was necessary that the representation in both 
Houses should be in proportion to their size. It ended in the 
compromise which you will see, but very much to the dissatisfaction of several members from the large States. 
</p><p>
It will not escape you that three names only from Virginia 
are subscribed to the act. Mr. Wythe did not return after the 
death of his lady. Doctor M c Clurg left the Convention some 
time before the adjournment. The Governor and Col. Mason 
refused to be parties to it. Mr. Gerry was the only other member who refused. The objections of the Governor turn principally on the latitude of the general powers, and on the connection established between the President and the Senate. He 
wished that the plan should be proposed to the States, with 
liberty to them to suggest alterations, which should all be referred to another General Convention, to be incorporated into 
the plan as far as might be judged expedient. He was not inveterate in his opposition, and grounded his refusal to subscribe 
pretty much on his unwillingness to commit himself, so as not 
to be at liberty to be governed by further lights on the subject. 
</p><p>
Col. Mason left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> in an exceeding ill humour indeed. A number of little circumstances, arising in part from 
the impatience which prevailed towards the close of the business, conspired to whet his acrimony. He returned to Virginia 
with a fixed disposition to prevent the adoption of the plan, if 
possible. He considers the want of a Bill of Rights as a fatal 
objection. His other objections are to the substitution of the 
Senate in place of an Executive Council, and to the powers 
vested in that bt>dy ; to the powers of the Judiciary; to the vice 
president being made president of the Senate; to the smallness 
of the number of Representatives; to the restriction on the 
States with regard to ex post facto laws; and most of all, probably, to the power of regulating trade by a majority only of 
each House. He has some other lesserv.bjections. Being now 
under the necessity of justifying his refusal to sign, he will, of 
course, muster every possible one. His conduct has given great 
umbrage to the County of Fairfax, and particularly to the Town 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">ALEXANDRIA</a>. He is already instructed to promote in the Assembly the calling a Convention, and will probably be either 
not deputed to the Convention, or be tied up by express instructions. He did not object in general to the powers vested in 
the National Government so much as to the modification. In 
some respects he admitted that some further powers would have 
improved the system. He acknowledged, in particular, that a 
negative on the State laws and the appointment of the State 
Executives ought to be ingredients; but supposed that the public mind would not now bear them, and that experience would 
hereafter produce these amendments. 
</p><p>
The final reception which will be given by the people at large 
to the proposed system cannot yet be decided. The Legislature 
of New Hampshire was sitting when it reached that State, and 
was well pleased with it. As far as the sense of the people 
there has been expressed, it is generally favorable. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> is 
warm and almost unanimous in embracing it. The impression 
on the country is not yet known. No symptoms of disapprobation have appeared. The Legislature of that State is now sitting, through which the sense of the people at large will soon 
be promulged with tolerable certainty. The paper-money faction in Rhode Island is hostile. The other party zealously attached to it. Its passage through Connecticut is likely to be 
very smooth and easy. There seems to be less agitation in this 
State [<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>] than anywhere. The discussion of the subject seems confined to the Newspapers. The principal characters are known to be friendly. The Governour's party, which 
has hitherto been the popular and most numerous one, is supposed to be on the opposite side; but considerable reserv.is 
practiced, of which he sets the example. New Jersey takes the 
affirmative side, of course. Meetings of the people are declaring their approbation and instructing their representatives. 
</p><p>
Pennsylvania will be divided. The City of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, the 
Republican party, the Quakers, and most of the Germans, espouse the Constitution. Some of the Constitutional leaders, 
backed by the Western Country, will oppose. An unlucky ferment on the subject in their Assembly just before its late adjournment has irritated both sides, particularly the opposition, 
and by redoubling the exertions of that party may render the 
event doubtful. The voice of Maryland, I understand from 
pretty good authority, is, as far as it has been declared, strongly 
in favor of the Constitution. Mr. Chase is an enemy, but the 
Town of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, which he now represents, is warmly attached 
to it, and will shackle him as far as it can. Mr. Paca will 
probably be, as usual, in the politics of Chase. 
</p><p>
My information from Virginia is as yet extremely imperfect. 
I have a letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">General Washington</a>, which speaks favorably of the impression within a circle of some extent; and 
another from Chancellor Pendleton, which expresses his full 
acceptance of the pkm, and the popularity of it in his district. 
I am told, also, that Innes and Marshall are patrons of it. In 
the opposite scale are Mr. James Mercer, Mr. R. H. Lee, Doctor Lee, and their connections, of course, Mr. M. Page, according to report, and most of the Judges and bar of the General 
Court. The part which Mr. Henry will take is unknown here. 
Much will depend on it. I had taken it for granted, from a 
variety of circumstances, that he would be in the opposition, 
and still think that will be the case. There are reports, however, which favor a contrary supposition. 
</p><p>
From the States South of Virginia nothing has been heard. 
As the deputation from South Carolina consisted of some of its 
weightiest characters, who have returned unanimously zealous 
in favor of the Constitution, it is probable that State will readily embrace it. It is not less probable that North Carolina 
will follow the example, unless that of Virginia should counterbalance it. Upon the whole, although the public mind will not 
be fully known, nor finally settled, for a considerable time, appearances at present augur a more prompt and . general adoption of the plan than could have been well expected. 
</p><p>
November I. Commodore Paul Jones having preferred another 
vessel to the packet, has remained here till this time. The interval has produced little necessary to be added to the above. 
The Legislature of Massachusetts have, it seems, taken up the 
act of the Convention, and have appointed, or probably will appoint, an early day for its State Convention. There are, 
also, from Georgia, which denote a favorable disposition. I 
am informed from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> that the new Election law from 
the Revised Code produced a pretty full House of Delegates, as 
well as a Senate, on the first day. It had previously had equal 
effect in producing full meetings of the freeholders for the county 
elections. A very decided majority of the Assembly is said to 
be zealous in favor of the New Constitution. The same is said 
of the Country at large. It appears, however, that individuals 
of great weight, both within and without the Legislature, are 
opposed to it. A letter I just have from Mr. A. Stuart names 
Mr. Henry, General Nelson, W. Nelson, the family of Cabells, 
S* George Tucker, John Taylor, and the Judges of the General 
Court, except P. Carriugton. The other opponents he describes 
as of too little note to be mentioned, which gives a negative information of the characters on the other side. All are agreed 
that the plan must be submitted to a Convention. 
, We hear from Georgia that that State is threatened with a 
dangerous war with the Creek Indians. The alarm is of so 
serv.us a nature that law-martial has been proclaimed, and they 
are proceeding to fortify even the town of Savannah. The idea 
there is, that the Indians derive their motives as well as their 
means from their Spanish neighbours. Individuals complain, 
also, that their fugitive slaves are encouraged by East Florida. 
The policy of this is explained by supposing that it is considered as a discouragement to the Georgians to form settlements 
near the Spanish boundaries. 
There are but few States on the spot here which will survive 
the expiration of the federal year, and it is extremely uncertain 
when a Congress will again be formed. We have not yet heard 
who are to be in the appointment of Virginia for the next 
year.
