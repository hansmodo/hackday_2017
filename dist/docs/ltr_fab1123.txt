Once more entered the Golden Gate today, sixty-seven days from Tahiti and thirty-three from Hawaii. For the first week out we had northeast wind and ran off northwest. Then a week calm and then a week a gale of wind from the N.E., off course, right ahead. For three days it blew so hard that we carried nothing but a storm stay sail, lashed the helm and all hands went below and let her worry. When it abated we got an observation and found ourselves in latt 44° N., long 167° W., actually nearer Kansehatsa than California.

The second Sunday out carried away the fore topmast and the jibboom for the second time but Capt. P. rigged the topmast so that we could set the topsail, reefed and spliced the boom and in this way we crawled along. We ate up all our provisions but potatoes and hard bread but we have the consolation that the Jane A. Hersey only arrived twelves hours before us and we beat the John Alvyn from Towahae by three days. The weather has been awful on the Pacific this Spring. When we approached the harbor we noticed the water covered with cinders and pieces of burnt wood and when the boarding officer boarded us he gave us the news that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> had disappeared--all burnt up. We left a fine, flourishing city built of brick, mostly, and supposed to be fireproof but it was all gone, sure enough; nothing but the
ends of the long wharves and the outskirts of the city left. I could hardly find where the streets used to be. This is the fourth time that this unfortunate city has been destroyed. I should think that they would be discouraged entirely, but they are already rebuilding it fast, but it has received an awful blow and it will be a long time before it gets up again as it was before.

Trade is pretty good. We have commenced picking over our cargo and about one half the oranges are good. We have sold them all for $40 per thousand. The potatoes are nearly all good and look as well as when they were taken in. They are worth about 7¢ per lb now. If we had arrived a month ago, as we ought to with an average passage, we should have done well. As it is, it will take all probably to pay the vessel and crews wages, etc. I shall be perfectly satisfied if it does not bring me in debt and call it time and money well spent.

Ed Kirk is with Flint & P. still. He spent the night on board and gave me several letters from you and Father. I hear Sewall is at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=sacramento">Sacramento</a> with Stover. I am afraid he lays idle too much, but he always was lazy. I expect to go to the mines after we get through. Miners are doing as well as ever and business is uncertain. I suppose you think that after such a voyage I shall have had enough of the sea, but there is no business suits me so well as a trading voyage and I never have been better contented than this winter. I have become perfectly accustomed to calms and gales and have schooled myself to observe the following maxim: 'Never to grumble at what can be helped and what can't be helped.'

I have had such hard luck lately in business and have gone through so many dangers and had my life saved that I think Providence has something in reserve for me yet and I have a presentiment I shall find a small pile in the mines. It is the heighth of my ambition now (for I
have given up all idea of ever making a fortune) to make money to pay my debts and buy a fine clipper vessel and go on another cruise among those 'Gems of the Ocean.' I hope to be able to by next winter--to carry out my plans. I wish almost you had remained an old maid so you would go with me for I know you and I think alike about this. I delight to visit and hold intercourse with foreign countries and next to a beautiful woman I admire a handsome vessel and in this harbor you can suit yourself, at your own price almost. There are about five hundred lying here now. It is astonishing but not one burnt up.

The commerce of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> is extending to all parts of the Pacific and all sorts of articles are brought here. One vessel from Mexico brought a cargo of cats and they sold readily for $8 and $12. If I owned a vessel I know of several voyages that I think would pay well. During this cruise I have gotten a great deal of information about the Pacific Islands and I hope to turn it to some account by and by.

I don't think I shall write you again until next Fall. I shall go up country and find Cole, and then I don't know where I shall be. Write to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> for I shall make this my headquarters and most probably shall be here next Fall.

Kirk sends his respects. He likes California very much. I have some curiousities from the Islands that I should like to send you and will the first opportunity. You can dress your little Alice in tappa, 'a la Marquese,' but you ought to learn how to swim for certainly I never saw girls in such graceful attitudes or look so bewitching as these island nymphs swimming.

I remain, your affectionate brother in decayed circumstances.
