My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It gives me great pleasure to inform that the Assembly yesterday, without a dissenting voice, complimented you with fifty shares in the Potomac Company, and one hundred in the James River Company, 
of which I give you early notice to stop your subscribing on your own account. As this compliment 
is intended by your country in commemoration of 
your assiduous cares to promote her interest, I hope 
you will have no scruples in accepting the present, 
and thereby gratifying them in their most earnest 
wishes. I most sincerely tender you and your good 
lady the compliments of the season, and many happy 
renewals of it ; and am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=beh" rel="me">Benjamin Harrison</a>.
