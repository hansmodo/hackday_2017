<a rel='month origin' value='1'>January</a> <a rel='day origin' value='4'>4th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. Mrs. Ives wants us to translate a French 
play. A genuine French captain came in from his ship on the James River and gave us good advice as to how to make 
the selection. General Hampton sent another basket of partridges, and all goes merry as a marriage bell.

My husband came in and nearly killed us. He brought this piece of news: " North Carolina wants to offer terms 
of peace ! ! We needed only a break of that kind to finish us. I really shivered nervously, as one does when the first 
handful of earth comes rattling down on the coffin in the grave of one we cared for more than all who are left.
