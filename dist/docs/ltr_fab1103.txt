Ho for California and the Gold Regions!
Westward the Star of Empire takes its Way!
</p><p>
So does the George Emery tomorrow! No doubt you thought us off before this but we have been getting ready for the last week and are not ready yet.
</p><p>
We have our cargo all on board and to-night the chickens and pigs come down. We have our cabin fitted up in splendid style. The curtains cost 56¢ per yard. We shall take them out and put them up in our house in California. Cole and I have bought everything we can think of for our comfort. We have raced all over <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a> and made some of the greatest bargains this side of Connecticut. We bought 58 volumes of books for $9.44 and a B.G.
board and one dozen packs of cards. We have 24 rifles, powder and shot, harpoons, fishing tackle and a sail boat and all the little etceteras you can think of, to amuse ourselves on our long voyage. I can't realize that I am going yet, but suppose I shall in about two days.
</p><p>
Our passengers I like the appearance of very well. There are seven of us altogether, all young men but one. One fellow pays Cole $46 for the privilege of working his passage. We can get men enough for nothing. The excitement here at this time, you can have no idea of. Every day witnesses the departure of some gallant ship, swarming with people. The ships Albany, Sutton, Brooklyn, and Apollo sailed last week with over 150 passengers each. Today three left. The H. J. Bartlett that I was to have gone in left today with 67, for Chagres. Benson, Loomis, Pond, Henshaw and a host of my friends go in her. They don't go off boohooing but go in good spirits.
</p><p>
The docks are crowded with fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters and sweethearts, and such embracing and waving of handkerchiefs and 'I say Bill! If you send me a barrel of Gold Dust don't forget to pay the freight on it!'. One fellow who went in the Brooklyn, threw his last five dollar piece ashore. Says he: 'I'm going where there is plenty more!'. 'Now boys, give'em the cheers,' and the boys from the ship give us nine back with a will. All those that have friends bid them farewell and those who have none shake hands with themselves and cut their individual sticks. It beats all!, I declare, this California fever.

Every minister is preaching on the subject. Geologists are lecturing on it. It is dramatised at the theatres and it is the subject of conversation everywhere. Even clerks' salaries have gone up, so many have left.
</p><p>
Tell Father, that the best thing he can do is to follow
me, if he has his business closed up. We will have a house put up all ready soon after we arrive, as we have four, all framed windows, doors and everything. We ought to have a good carpenter go out with us, though I think I can put one up myself. The worst feature of the business is: there are no females going out. Everything else that you can think of is going, but the ladies hang back. What are we going to do? Society is bad, you know, composed all together of either sex. The women must follow the men shortly, or they will be too thick on this side--and to think what rich husbands they could get! I should think this would be an inducement for the old maids of Bucksport to start! This leads me to speak of what Tim told me yesterday.
</p><p>
Says he: 'I shall be married before you get back.' Says I: 'Tim, when is it coming off?' 'Next fall,' says he. 'I think of it seriously.' Thinks I to myself: 'Miss M-- P-- may produce her documents before that time and spoil your fun, and serve you right, too.'
</p><p>
I have been enjoying the society of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a> ladies all I could the past two weeks. However, there is no very strong attachment of the heart to cause pangs at leaving, as Connor says.
</p><p>
I would like to spend one evening at home before leaving and see you all once more, but I hope I shall meet you all when I come back--when that will be I can't tell.
</p><p>
Give my best regards to Joseph, Ed, Sewall and all the folks. Tell Sewall I will write him from California and especially remember me to my dear Mother. I wrote her last week and will write Father tonight or tomorrow.
</p><p>
And now, my dear Sister, although I am a long distance from you I feel as though you were by my side and I conversing instead of writing to you. You have the largest share of my affections of any being in this world
and although I may not have shown it in my conduct, yet I do love and think more of you than anyone else, and will remain,
</p><p>
Ever your affectionate brother.
