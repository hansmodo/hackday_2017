My good Friend, 
</p><p>
Your favour of the 4th November last found me in England, where, though I suffered much sickness, I left the pain 
in my breast ; but a sore throat I caught there still remains 
obstinate and troublesome. 
</p><p>
The resolution of Congress of 1st October last, did not 
reach me until in December. On my return here last 
month, I wrote in pursuance of it to Mr. Carmichael to 
come here without delay with the books and vouchers. I 
daily expect to hear from him, and shall be happy to see 
that business settled before I embark, which I hope will be 
in April, but from or to what port, and in what vessel, is as 
yet uncertain. 
</p><p>
There is no doubt but that you have had much to struggle 
with, and will have more. Difficulties must continue inseparable from your office for some time yet, and they will 
be the means either of increasing or diminishing your reputation. In my opinion you must go on. Success generally 
attends talents and perseverance, and these thorns will in 
due season probably bear flowers, if not fruit. 
</p><p>
There are parts of your letter, on which, though I concur with you in sentiment, I forbear to make remarks, 
because this may not pass to you uninspected. I hope we 
shall meet in the course of a few months more, and then 
reserve will cease to be necessary. 
</p><p>
What you say of <a href='/results.php?tla=gom' rel='colleague friend met'>Gouverneur</a> accords with my opinion 
of him. I have never broken the bands of friendship in 
my life, nor when once broken, have I ever been anxious 
to mend them. Mine with him will, I hope, last as long as 
we do, for though my sentiments of mankind in general are 
less favourable than formerly, my affection for certain individuals is as warm and cordial as ever. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Jay presents her affectionate compliments to you 
and Mrs. Morris, to whom we join in sincerely wishing all 
the happiness with which amiable merit should be ever 
blessed. Tell <a href='/results.php?tla=gom' rel='colleague friend met'>Gouverneur</a> I long to take him by the hand, 
and believe me to be, my dear sir, 
</p><p>
With constant attachment, 
Your affectionate friend and servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>.
