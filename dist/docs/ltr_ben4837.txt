DEAR FRIEND, <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city origin'>London</a> <a rel="month origin" value="2">Feb</a> <a rel='day origin' value='4'>4</a> <a href='/results.php?year=1772' rel="origin">1772</a>
</p><p>
I have written two or three small Letters to you since my 
Return from Ireland and Scotland. I now have before me 
your Favours of Oct. i. Nov. 5. and Nov. 13. Mr. Todd has 
not yet shewn me that which you wrote to him about the New 
Colony, tho' he mentioned it, and will let me see it, I suppose, 
when I call on him. I told you in one of mine, that he has 
advanced for your Share what has been paid by others, tho' 
I was ready to do it, and shall in the whole Affair take the 
same Care of your Interest as of my own. 
</p><p>
You take Notice that "<a href='/results.php?tla=thw' rel='friend met co-worker'>Mr. Wharton</a>'s Friends will not 
allow me any Merit in this Transaction, but insist the Whole is owing to his superior Abilities." It is a common Error in 
Friends when they would extol their Friend, to make Comparisons & to depreciate the Merits of others. It was not 
necessary for his Friends to do so in this Case. <a href='/results.php?tla=thw' rel='friend met co-worker'>Mr. Wharton</a> 
will in Truth have a good deal of Merit in the Affair if it succeeds, he having been exceedingly active and industrious in 
soliciting it, and in drawing up Memorials and Papers to support the Application, remove objections, etc. But tho' I have 
not been equally active, (it not being thought proper that I 
should appear much in the Solicitation since I became a little 
obnoxious to the Ministry on Ace' of my Letters to America) 
yet I suppose my Advice may have been thought of some 
Use, since it has been ask'd on every Step, and I believe that 
being longer and better known here than <a href='/results.php?tla=thw' rel='friend met co-worker'>Mr. Wharton</a>, I may 
have lent some Weight to his Negociations by joining in the 
Affair, from the greater Confidence men are apt to place in 
one they know, than in a Stranger. However, as I neither 
ask nor expect any particular Consideration for any Service 
I may have done, and only think I ought to escape Censure, 
I shall not enlarge on this invidious Topic. 
</p><p>
Let us all do our Endeavours, in our several Capacities, 
for the common Service, and if one has the Ability or Opportunity of doing more for his Friends than another, let him 
think that a Happiness, and be satisfied. The Business is 
not yet quite compleated, and as many Things happen between the Cup & the Lip, perhaps there may be nothing of 
this kind for Friends to dispute about. For if nobody should 
receive any Benefit, there would be no Scrambling for the 
Honour. Stavers is in the wrong to talk of my promising him 
the Rider's Place again. I only told him that I would (as he 
requested it) recommend him to Mr. Hubbard, to be replac'd 
if it could be done without Impropriety or Inconveniency. 
This I did, & the rather as I had always understood him to 
be a good honest punctual Rider. His Behaviour to you 
entitles him to no Favour and I believe any Application he 
may make here, will be to little purpose: 
</p><p>
In yours from N. York, of July 3. You mention'd your 
Intention of purchasing a Bill to send hither, as soon as you 
return'd home from your Journey. I have not since receiv'd 
any from you, which I only take notice of to you, that if you 
have sent one you may not blame me for not acknowledging 
the Receipt of it. 
</p><p>
In mine of April 20. I explained to you what I had before 
mentioned, that in settling our private Account, I had paid 
you the sum of 389^, (or thereabouts,) in my own Wrong, 
having before paid it for you to the General PostOffice. I 
hope that since you have receiv'd your Books & looked over 
the Accounts, you are satisfy'd of this. I am anxious for 
your Answer upon it, the sum being too large to be left long 
without an Adjustment. My Love to my Daughter, and 
Compliments to your Brother. I am ever, my dear friend, 
Yours most Affectionately, B FRANKLIN.
