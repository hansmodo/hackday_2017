TO COUNT DE ROCHAMBEAU.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have this morning received your Excellency's favor 
of last evening. I think it will be very well for your 
Excellency to proceed to-morrow to North Castle, 
where you will continue until you assemble your whole 
force, unless you should hear from me within that time. 
Being at North Castle will put you in a direct route 
to receive your provisions from Crompond, and it will 
be in a direct way for your troops to advance to White 
Plains, or any other point below, as circumstances shall 
appear to demand. 
</p><p>
Colonel Hull, an active and very intelligent officer, will have the honor to deliver this to your Excellency. 
He is charged with my instructions to the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='co-worker'>Duke De Lauzun</a> ; and, being perfectly acquainted with our intended movements, and with the scene of operations, 
he will give all the aid in his power to the Duke. The same gentleman will be able to reply to any queries your Excellency shall be pleased to put to him. 
With perfect esteem and regard, I am, &,c. 
</p>
