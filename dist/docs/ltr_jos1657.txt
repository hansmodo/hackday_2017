Dear Brother : I am at last engaged in recruiting. I 
have received an order from Gov. Dennison to raise two 
regiments of Infantry, one squadron of Cavalry, and a 
battery of artillery, and I am now hard at work executing the order. I want a good Colonel, an educated, brave, 
reliable officer. I must have him. The orders of the 
Governor give me the utmost latitude in the selection of 
the officers of this force and I am determined it shall be 
well commanded if proper officers can be obtained. Can 
you name me one as Major, and one as Lieutenant Colonel? They will receive promotion upon the meeting 
of Congress, when I shall resign the nominal place of 
Colonel. In the multiplicity of your important duties I 
trust you can name such officers as I wish. I would 
like it all the better if one at least of them may be a 
Kentuckian, as this force is intended for Kentucky. 
</p><p>
Affy. Your Brother,
