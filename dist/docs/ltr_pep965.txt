My Dear Friend:--I am comfortably seated in the old Record office this morning, with matters and things around me, just as they were when you were among us.
</p><p>
The last mail from California brought me a letter from you, and the Herald announcing your connection with its publication. I hope it may eventually be of advantage to you. I would like to be with you, in publishing some paper. I think you will make money with the Herald. Your letter for publication is a good one and will appear in the Record. Tell Clint I saw a recent letter from him in which he is quite humorous and in good spirits. Success to him.

West Chester was the focus of great excitement growing out of a murder trial going on in Court. The murderer was found guilty and sentenced to be hung. This murder--a great subject of local interest--added a large number of new subscribers to our list.

Mr. Evans is a candidate for State Senator, the office of which is to be filled at the coming fall election. If he should get the nomination, he designs to withdraw from some of the labors of publishing the Record.

I did not hear Jenny Lind. The admission was too high.

My old fellow, you are much mistaken when you suppose I am going to get married shortly. No, sir. I will give you information of it in advance, when it is to take place. I don't want a wife--I have no use for one.

Robert Lewis went astray from the principles of the Gideons, but has since repented, paid his fine, and is again a full brother.

A few days ago I wrote to your mother in relation to your brother Jefferson. Samuel Evans wants a boy to assist in attending store. I think your brother would suit him. I hope he will come to West Chester and if he should, I would take pleasure in giving him counsel and in making him feel at home.

The returned Californians in West Chester are recovering their health and going to work, and appear now to be contented with West Chester.
</p><p>
Excuse the careless manner in which this is written. I was about half asleep while penning it. Present my warmest regards to Clint.
</p><p>
Your old friend,
