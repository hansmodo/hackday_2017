MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
HAVE you seen a list of the addressers of the late 
Governor ? There is one abroad, with the character, profession or occupation of each person against his 
name. I have never seen it, but Judge Brown saye, against the name of Andrew Faneuil Phillips is 
" Nothing." And that Andrew, when he first heard 
of it, said : " Better be nothing with one side, than 
every thing with the other." This was witty and 
smart, whether Andrew said it, or, what is more likely, 
it was made for him. A notion prevails among all 
parties, that it is politest and genteelest to be on the 
side of Administration; that the better sort, the 
wiser few are on one side ; and that the multitude, 
the vulgar, the herd, the rabble, the mob only are on 
the other. So difficult it is for the frail, feeble mind 
of roan to shake itself loose from all prejudice and 
habits. However Andrew or his prompter is perfectly right in his judgment, and will finally be proved to 
be so, that the lowest on the Tory scale will make it 
more for his interest than the highest on the Whiggish. And as long as a man adheres immovably to 
his own interest, and has understanding or luck enough 
to secure and promote it, he will have the character 
of a man of sense, and will be respected by a selfish 
world. I know of no better reason for it than this, 
that most men are conscious that they aim at their 
own interest only, and that if they fail, it is owing to 
short sight or ill luck, and therefore they can't blame, 
but secretly applaud, admire and sometimes envy those, 
whose capacities have proved greater and fortunes more prosperous.

I am engaged in a famous cause. The cause of 
King of Scarborough versus a mob that broke into his 
house and rifled his papers and terrified him, his wife, 
children and servants in the night. The terror and distress, the distraction and horror of this family can 
not be described by words, or painted upon canvass. 
It is enough to move a statue, to melt a heart of stone, 
to read the story. A mind susceptible of the feelings 
of humanity, a heart which can be touched with sensibility for human misery and wretchedness mustlreluct, must burn with resentment and indignation at 
such outrageous injuries. These private mobs I do 
and will detest. If popular commotions can be justified in opposition to attacks upon the Constitution, it 
can be only, when fundamentals are invaded, nor then, 
unless for absolute necessity, and with great caution. But these tarrings and featherings, this breaking open 
houses by rude and insolent rabble in resentment for private wrongs, or in pursuance of private prejudices 
and passions, must be discountenanced. It cannot be even excused upon any principle, which can be entertained by a good citizen, a worthy member of society.

Dined with Mr. Collector Francis Waldo, Esquire, in company with Mr. Winthrop, the two Quincys and 
the two Sullivans, all very social and cheerful full of politics.'s. Quincy's tongue ran as fast as 
any body's. He was clear in it, that the House of Commons had no right to take money out of our 
pockets more than any foreign state ; repeated large paragraphs from a publication of Mr. Burke's 
in 1766, and large paragraphs from Junius Americanus, &c. This is to talk and to shine before persons 
who have no capacity of judging, and who do not know, that he is ignorant of every rope in the ship.

I shan't be able to get away till next week. I am concerned only in two or three cases, and none of 
them are come on yet Such an Eastern circuit I never made. I shall bring home as much as I brought 
from home, I hope, and not much more, I fear. I go mourning in my heart all the day long, though I say 
nothing. I am melancholy for the public and anxious for my family. As for myself, a frock and trowsers, a hoe and a spade would do for my remaining days.

For God's sake make your children hardy , active, and industrious; for strength, activity and industry will be their only resource and dependence.
