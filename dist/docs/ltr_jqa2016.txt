DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I have more than once mentioned to you the state of 
retirement from political conversation in which I live, and 
the restraints which I am endeavoring to lay upon a disposition inclining perhaps with too much ardor to feel 
interested in public occurrences. But it sometimes happens 
that I am accidentally witness to conversations upon these 
subjects, from which I collect some trifling information, 
that I imagine might at least not be unentertaining to you. 
In general I have supposed that your other correspondents 
in this quarter would anticipate me, and that I should only 
employ your time in reading a relation of occurrences which would not even have with you the merit of novelty. 
But from some late letters I have been led (though perhaps 
erroneously) to imagine your correspondents here have not 
been so punctual in their communications, as they have 
been formerly, and I have supposed I might mention some 
circumstances, which though generally known here might 
not be public at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. 
</p><p>
It appears to me that the hostile character of our general 
and particular governments each against the other is in 
creasing with accelerated rapidity. The spirit which at the 
time when the Constitution was adopted, it was contended 
would always subsist of balancing one of these governments 
by the other has I think almost totally disappeared already, 
and the seeds of two contending factions appear to be 
plentifully sown. The names of Federalist and Anti- 
federalist are no longer expressive of the sentiments which 
they were so lately supposed to contain, and I expect soon 
to hear a couple of new names, which will designate the 
respective friends of the national and particular systems. 
The people are very evidently dividing into these two parties. 
What the event will be I hardly allow myself to conjecture, but my soul asks 
</p><p>
To know when two authorities are up, 
Neither supreme, how soon confusion 
May enter twixt the gap of both, and take 
The one by the other. 
</p><p>
In point of measures the government of the United States 
has undoubtedly greatly the advantage. But while they 
are strengthening their hands by assuming the debts, and 
by making provision for the support of the public credit, 
the partisans of our State government are continually upon 
the rack of exertion to contrive every paltry expedient to maintain their importance and to check the operations of 
the government, which they behold with terror. As they 
can only clamor upon subjects of importance, their active 
efforts are used in appointing a premature fast, or in opposing the cession of a light house. In the last session of our 
General Court the light houses in this Commonwealth were 
not ceded to Congress. And the keeper of that at the 
entrance of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> Harbor has been forbidden upon his 
peril to receive any directions or pay from the federal 
officer. But the imbecility of our government renders all 
these exertions the more ridiculous ; for while they endeavor 
to prevent the assumption of their debt, they cannot even 
provide for the payment of the interest upon it. And they 
have never yet paid for two light houses at the entrance of 
this harbor, although they are so solicitous to retain them. 
</p><p>
The history of the additional amendments to the Constitution proposed by a joint committee of our two houses, 
affords further evidence of the petty arts which are used 
by the enemies to the national union to turn the tide of 
popular opinion against the national government. Mr. 
Austin, who, as I have been informed, had the principal 
agency in that affair, never expected that any amendments 
would be seriously proposed to Congress by our Legislature ; 
and there is an internal evidence, the report of the Committee, that it was intended for a declamation to the people 
rather than for amendments to the Constitution. They 
are not even pretended to be amendments, but after the 
long commonplace rhapsody upon the dangerous tendency 
of the government, when we come to the articles, we find 
them pretended to be nothing but principles for amendments. The Committee consisted of seven members, of 
whom only four were present when this report was agreed 
upon. Mr. Dana who drew it up was one of the absent, and it is said afterwards declared, that he should have 
objected to the two last articles (perhaps the most important of the whole number), though he drafted them himself. 
The two other absent members utterly disclaimed the report, and the chairman, who did not vote, was equally 
opposed to it. Three members only agreed upon the 
point, and when they produced the paper in the Senate, 
they obtained a vote to have a certain number of copies 
printed. It was then dismissed without being suffered to 
undergo the test of an examination, and Mr. Austin, I am 
told, made no scruple to acknowledge that he had answered 
his purpose. 
</p><p>
Yet even when opportunities are presented, where the 
importance of our own government might be really in 
creased, some other little selfish interested principle steps 
in, and produces measures calculated to bring it into con 
tempt. The appointment of N. Gushing upon the bench 
of our Supreme Court has certainly not tended to increase 
the confidence of the people in that important branch of 
the government. The appointment was very unpopular ; 
and what perhaps in a political view rendered the measure 
the more injudicious is, that it is not his integrity but his 
abilities that are called in question. But personal animosity against the characters who would have added 
dignity to that station, the apprehension of giving offence to the late Chief Justice, who it is said recommended his 
cousin too strongly, and the pleasure of removing a trouble 
some councillor, concurring together, were too powerful 
even for anti-federal principles, and produced we are told a 
nomination, which could be accounted for upon no other 
motives. The only liberal and generous measure by which 
they have pursued their system has been the raising the 
salaries of our judges, and I fear they would not have succeeded even in that, had not the personal interest of certain 
influential men, of very different principles been engaged 
and assisted to promote it. It is melancholy to observe 
how much, even in this free country, the course of public 
events depends upon the private interests and passions of 
individuals. 
</p><p>
But the popularity of the general government is, and for 
some time to come must continue to be disadvantageously 
affected by those very exertions to support the public 
credit, which must eventually strengthen it so effectually. 
It must suffer, however, chiefly in the seaports and among 
the merchants who find their interests affected by the 
operation of the revenue laws. In this town and still more 
in Salem, there have lately been considerable clamors 
raised by men who have been the firmest friends to the 
Constitution ; and there is now I presume before Congress 
a petition from the merchants in this town, praying relief 
from an evil, which has excited great complaints, but which 
will probably be remedied without difficulty. 
</p><p>
Those people among us who are perpetually upon the 
search for causes of complaint against the government, are cavilling at the dilatory manner with which the Congress 
proceed in their business. The decision upon the subject 
of discrimination has met with general approbation in the 
circles of company where I have heard it mentioned, and 
from the complexion of our newspapers, I have concluded 
that the public opinion, of which so much was said in the 
debates, is here much in favor of the measure. I do not 
think indeed that the public opinion can always be collected 
from newspapers, but they are never silent upon unpopular 
topics of so great importance. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="colleague">Mr. Madison's</a> reputation 
has suffered from his conduct in that affair; and Judge 
Dana is the only man I have known whose character gives 
weight to his opinions, that has adopted those of Mr. Madison. 
</p><p>
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury has in general 
met with great approbation. I have heard it almost universally spoken of with great applause. Yet I am almost 
ashamed to acknowledge that I know not how justly it is 
admired, as I have never read it. This neglect has rather 
been owing to accident than to inclination, for little as I 
attend to the public prints I should certainly have noticed a 
publication of so important a nature, had I been in the way 
of seeing the Gazette of the United States which contains it. 
I am equally ignorant of the system for the establishment 
of the militia, which is as much disliked as the treasurer's 
report is esteemed. The most favorable judgment that I 
have heard passed upon it was, that however excellent it 
might be, it would never be submitted to by the people. 
</p><p>
I know not but that I shall incur your censure for depart 
ing even in this instance from the line which I have pre 
scribed to myself, and losing the lawyer in the politician ; 
and still more for the freedom with which I have expressed 
myself upon public men and measures. If I should on 
this occasion meet with your disapprobation, I shall with 
out difficulty observe a more prudent silence upon these 
subjects in future. The opinions which I have heard ex 
pressed are no evidence of the general opinion even through 
out the Commonwealth, but in some instances they have 
been the opinions of men whose influence is great and extensive. But if the information contained in this letter should 
compensate in your mind for its tediousness, I shall from 
time to time continue to give you a similar supply. In 
the meantime I remain your affectionate son.
