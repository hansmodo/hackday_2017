Arrived Lieut. A. Gillespie of the U. States Marine Corps, who had secret Dispatches for Fremont, and wanted to overtake him on his route to Oregon. I furnished him with Animals, he went up to Peter Lassens with my Guide. At P. Lassens he hired Men and bought Animals to overtake Fremont. After a sharp riding he succeeded to overtake him, and returned with him to the Sacramento Valley.
