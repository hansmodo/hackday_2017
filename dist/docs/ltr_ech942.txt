Dearest Ellen:--Your kindly welcome letter of Dec. 8th reached me, acknowledging the receipt of mine of the last of October, together with the daguerreotype. It does the soul good and sends a thrill of joy through the whole system to receive and read letters like that. In the absence of late letters, I reread some of the first ones I ever received from you. I never read them over without being reminded of the night on which we parted the last time, the burning tears that were then shed, the mutual vows that were then made by us both, and then our last parting kiss. Those vows I have sacredly kept and intend to fulfill them all. I'm thinking of you nearly all the time.

You have spoken of our union and you tell me you think your parents would throw no obstacles in the way. That is well. Parents should be consulted in regard
to such matters, and it is always desirable that they should approve the choice of their children, but I must own to you that opposition from such a source would never deter me from marrying a lady if she were willing and I had confidence in my own ability to support and protect her. But happily for us no such objection exists, or at least if it does, it has not shown itself yet.

In one of my former letters, I suggested that it would be almost a year from the Christmas just past before I could return home. The announcement surprised and astonished you very much. I could not calculate with any certainty for I then had scarcely enough funds to carry me home. But as I told you, I have now made up my mind to return between now and the time cold weather sets in, and instead of only arriving there about next Christmas, I almost hope by that time to call you wife. How do you think that would sound? If I get home in September, it will be a little over the period of three years set down for my absence at the time I started. I don't want you to get tired of waiting.

Money without any other comforts or pleasures is of little value, and for the purpose of being again in your society, I willingly yield up all these fair prospects, although dimes can scarcely be made there where dollars are here. You have complained in several instances of my ambitious propensities. It may be, dear Ellen, that I have too grasping a spirit, but I regard a man without a laudable ambition with a feeling bordering on contempt. Moreover, I have found by my contact with mankind, which has been none of the smoothest, that a man lacking ambition, energy, and perseverance scarcely obtains to even a moderate degree of success.

An office companion, a fellow-printer, who has been
in this country five years, and engaged to a young lady in New York with whom he has been corresponding regularly ever since, and congratulating himself upon the happiness he would have next spring when he intended to return and make her his bride, received a letter from his brother recently stating that she had been married to another. Since then the poor fellow has been low spirited and melancholy, cursing the world and all things in it. He had loved her so much and believed her so true that he now regards the whole female race as a set of vile deceivers, and consigns them all to a fate to which the torments of Pluto's dominions would be a paradise. But I tell him they are not all so. I tell him I know at least one who could never act so basely. But she has deceived him so much that his whole future life will be one of misery. He can never love again and will ever be wretched. What must her feelings be? She cannot be happy!

I received a letter from Mr. Thornbury. He said a great many funny things. I told him you had made frequent inquiry concerning him, and he said I should give you his respects and tell you he was flourishing. He is far north in the Indian Country and has lost considerable by Indians, but is doing very well and is in fine spirits. He will probably return home next summer. I would like to go in company with him.

Believe me as heretofore, faithfully yours,
