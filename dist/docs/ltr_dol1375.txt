MY DARLING HUSBAND, I have just parted from Colonel Patton, who is well 
pleased with the payment of the horses, and congratulated me on possessing such 
a handsome pair. I went to pay some visits this morning, and on my return 
found Anthony Morris waiting, with a petition from his wife that I would let him 
wait upon me to her house for some days ; but am too fearful of taxing my strength, 
much as I love these old and dear friends. I see that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="friend met">Jackson's</a> paper has announced 
the declaration of war from Spain against us, and that the Marquis d Yrujo has requested his passport. He was here with 
other company last evening. Mrs. Stewart inquired if this was true, and he became 
terribly angry. Thureau is ill, but goes abroad too. The impression of him in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> is a sad one ; he is remembered as the cruel commander at La Vendee, and the fighting husband. I am about 
to put up the articles for the President, and will inclose a note for you, too.

November 17. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="sibling met">Anna</a> and her husband arrived last evening, my beloved, and so 
pleased and agitated was I, that I could not sleep. We will leave on Monday, if I 
am quite strong enough ; but I will wait your commands. Farewell, my beloved one.
