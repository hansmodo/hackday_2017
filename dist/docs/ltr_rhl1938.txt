SIR From a person quite unknown to you, some apology may be necessary for this letter. The name of my brother, Dr. Arthur Lee, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, may perhaps, 
furnish me with this apology. To be firmly attached to the cause of liberty on virtuous principles, is a powerful cause of union, and renders proper, the most easy 
communication of sentiment, however artfully disunion may be promoted and encouraged by tyrants, and their abettors. If this be true in general, how more certainly 
is it so, in that particular state of affairs, in which every scheme that cunning can form, or power execute, is practised to reduce to slavery, so considerable a portion 
of the human species, as North America does, and may contain. Every day's experience proves this, to an attentive observer. Among other instances in proof, if I 
mistake not, the manner of resenting the loss of the Gaspie, is one. At this distance, and through the uncertain medium of newspapers, we may never, perhaps, 
have received a just account of this affair. I should be extremely glad, sir, when your leisure permits, to have as true a state of the matter, as the public with you, has 
been furnished with. At all events, this military parade appears extraordinary, unless the intention be, to violate 
all law and legal forms, in order to establish the ministerial favourite, but fatal precedent, of removing Americans beyond the water, to be tried for supposed offences 
committed here. This is so unreasonable, and so unconstitutional a stretch of power, that I hope it will never be permitted to take place, while a spark of virtue, or 
one manly sentiment remains in America. The primary end of government seems to be, the security of life and property; but this ministerial law, would, if acquiesced 
in, totally defeat every idea of social security and happiness. You may easily, sir, perceive, that 1 understand myself, writing to a firm and worthy friend of the just 
rights and liberty of America, by the freedom with which this letter is penned. Captain Snow, of your town, who comes frequently here, and who takes care 
of this, will bring me any letter you may be pleased to favour me with. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, with singular esteem, yours, &c.
