EDS. True Delta --My last communication was from Grass Valley, California, dated, I think, in February. I do not know whether it reached you or not, but it was my last from the land of gold On my arrival at home, I became fully aware of the vastness of the throng which is hurrying on to distress, to misery, and immense suffering by a headlong journey across the plains. If a true representation of the condition of California would have any effect in preventing individual suffering, the readers of the True Delta would be benefited, for your columns have set forth these things in their proper light always, and to me it seems strange that people should become so infatuated as to rush into dangers with eyes wide open. California is indeed a great country, with a beautiful climate and fertile soil, and in this last particular I have been compelled to change my early opinion And gold is there in such quantities that I do not believe that the labor of a century can exhaust it. But because such is the fact, do not let any man say, "If it is there, I can get it." There are difficulties in the way which are insuperable. There are just as smart men there who are as industrious, as energetic and prudent, as the best who are now on their way. Three years' experience proves that where one of these energetic men is successful, hundreds are scarcely making a living. From the commencement to the present moment the continual cry of "new discoveries--rich diggings," has been brought to the public eye, and how many have been successful? Not one tenth part of those engaged in mining, and those are mostly of that class of men whose nerves and sinews are braced to stand the severe labor by practice from childhood. Thousands of those who cannot endure the labor of the mines, or who have been unsuccessful, have returned to the Valley and are exercising the various trades and professions to which they were accustomed at home, so that every trade is overrepresented, and profits are cut down to a living business--in many instances scarcely affording that--and before I left, hundreds were unable to obtain employment for their board. And when you add fifty thousand souls to those already there, the number of helpless ones will increase rather than diminish.

There may be five thousand farms opened in California this season, perhaps more, and next year double that number. Farming at this moment is profitable, but will it continue so to the end of time? When I first went there, all our vegetables were brought from the Sandwich Islands, Australia, and Oregon, and a small part from Spanish America, and the prices were exorbitant.
</p><p>
Now California raises her own vegetables, or nearly so, and in such abundance that prices have fallen almost immeasurably. For instance, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1849">1849</a>-50 potatoes sold in San Francisco from twenty to thirty cents per pound. These were brought from abroad. Now they are sold, of a superior quality and raised at home, at from three to five cents. Importation has virtually ceased. Flour is still imported, but in one year California will raise wheat enough for home consumption; in two there will be a surplus, and with no outlet prices must fall so much as to reduce farming to a mere living profit. The soil of California is capable of producing a greater amount than that of our Western prairies even. Sixty and eighty bushels of wheat to the acre is common. I have many statistical items in my possession attesting its agricultural capacities, and you know my early opinion was at antipodes with this. Now all this in political economy is well, and speaks well for the capacity of the State; but when we reflect that beyond home consumption the market will be limited, the natural inference is that farming in a short time will be no more profitable than other kinds of business. And those who cannot work cannot live. The immense emigration of this year will probably keep the prices of provisions up for the season. They may, in fact, advance, while the price of labor will decline and thousands seek employment as they do now, in vain; but at the moment there is a surplus, which will be within the next two years, there will be no sale. The only business that I know of now that is not being overdone is lumbering. The mountains are accessible for wagons and railroads and can furnish the lumber which is now imported, and will do so as soon as the prices of labor and hauling are sufficiently reduced to compete with importing prices. The country is large enough and productive enough to support a dense population, and individual suffering would be less if it was filled up by degrees; but one great difficulty is, too many are rushing in at once before the way is sufficiently prepared for them. Now a limited number can cross the plains safely and with comfort if properly provided, but this year there are too many going at once. In addition to the stock actually required to draw the wagons on the road, a large number of cattle are being driven for market. They will generally reach the Rocky Mountains in safety--that is, there will be grass enough to sustain the cattle. But immediately on going through the South Pass
the desert country commences, grass will be difficult to obtain and, I believe, impossible for so great a number. The consequence will be that the cattle of emigrant trains will die, and families will have a terra firma shipwreck, hundreds of miles from human aid. If they have money to duplicate their teams from droves, they may be partially relieved; but very many will not be able to pay the California prices which will be asked, and they will be left to get along the best way they can, which will be on foot, or die.

We shall probably receive as heart-rending accounts of the sufferings of the present emigration across the plains as any which have preceded it. After the emigration of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1850">1850</a>, such was the waste of property on the road that travelers from Salt Lake or between trading posts in the region, where there was little or no wood, were scarcely troubled a single night to collect fuel to cook with, for the wagons abandoned and the furniture, handles of picks, shovels, axes, &c., &c., furnished them an abundant supply, and this will probably be the case after the present emigration has passed.

I had intended to have spoken of the Nicaragua route in this communication, but it is already long enough. With my experience in crossing the plains I would rather take a family to California by the land route, provided the emigration did not exceed ten thousand, than through Central America, with the present facilities of traveling up the San Juan River and to San Juan del Sur. As it is, I would not risk their lives this year, either way.
