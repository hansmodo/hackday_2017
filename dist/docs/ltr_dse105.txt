<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1988">1988</a><br><br>

My niece, Gail A. Brough, widow, two children - Hans, almost 21 (in the Army) and
Heidi, 18, just out of high school. Gail was almost killed in a head-on auto crash
in December of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1979">1979</a>. Lasting physical impairment, some brain damage. Under conservatorship
while convalescing, but dissolved by judge.<br><br>

Her father, my brother, died in 1978. Her mother died five or six years later. Younger
sister Kathy Endsley brought up kids. From mother's estate she received securities appraised
at $134,179 (according to figure supplied to me), since sold, and a lot near Murphys appraised
at $14,000 which she still has. She also owns a three bedroom townhouse in Santa Clara (no mortgage)
and a house on Whidby Island in Washington (Langley). At her request I have placed the latter
property on the market, asking $119,500.<br><br>

I worried about her ability to cope and offered my help several times, but she refused it and would
not even let me look over her portfolio until she completely ran out of money about four months ago.<br><br>

My reconstruction indicates that she sold all of her securities in July of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1985">1985</a> for a net of
$135,711.94 (capital gain only $1533) and lived on her principal until it ran out about 33 months later. During 
that period she apparently had no income except $400 a month in rent from her Langley house, which
would be partly offset by depreciation.<br><br>

While she was in the hospital about two months ago a letter came from the State Franchise Tax Board
saying she owed $25,000 in capital gains tax on the stock sale, plus penalties and interest. She may
owe something, but that figure is patently ridiculous.<br><br>

I found tax returns for four years, 1980-1983, prepared by Edward G. Velasquez of Sunnyvale. For that
year she owed no Federal tax, but paid a State tax of $34. Apparently she has filed no tax returns
since then, but probably should have for 1984 and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1985">1985</a>, since she had divided income from the securities she 
inherited from her mother, and she had the small capital gain from the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1985">1985</a> securities sale. Between depreciation,
her personal exemption, and charitable contributions, I doubt that she would have owed any tax in 1986 or 1987,
even if she was required to file.<br><br>

Gail's sister Kathy paid her homeowner dues of $1022.50, which were in arrears. Aside from those things and the
California tax claim, I know of only one other problem; she did not pay second half 1987-88 taxes on the
Santa Clara townhouse, the Langley house, or the Murphys lot because she didn't have any money and didn't tell anyone.
(Even with penalties, that's not a lot of money).<br><br>

What I'm trying to do is to sell the Langley house, clean up her debts, and get the Santa Clara property ready for 
rental or sale. That would provide enough for her to live modestly in a rented apartment, or perhaps to buy a trailer
in an area trailer park. And if you have any ideas on how to keep her from selling her property and spending the
money again, please let me know.<br><br>

The most urgent problem, as I see it, is to get the State of California off her back. Everything else can be handled - 
at least until she derails herself again.
