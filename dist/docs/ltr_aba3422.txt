MY DEAR NIECE, 
</p><p>
My fourth letter I begin to you. I dare not reckon 
the number I have to write ; lest I should feel discouraged in the attempt, I must circumscribe myself to half a sheet of paper. Raree-shows are so 
much the taste of this country, that they make one 
even of the corpse of great people ; and the other 
day a gentleman presented me with a card to go 
and see the corpse of the Duke of Northumberland, 
who died at his house in the country, but was 
brought here to be laid in state. " It is," said he, 
"a senseless piece of pageantry; but, as such, I 
would advise you to see it." It is practised only 
with crowned heads, and some of the most ancient 
families of Dukes. The late Duke was father to 
Lord Percy, whom the Americans well remember. 
His Lordship (who lives a few doors from us), being 
the elder son, inherits the title and estate, and is now 
Duke of Northumberland. 
Northumberland House is in the city. A great, 
immense pile of building, to which one enters through 
massy iron gates. At these gates stood four porters, 
clad in black ; the court, up to the house, was hung 
in black, and divided by a temporary railing, that 
the spectators might pass in upon one side, and out 
upon the other. From the court we entered a long 
suite of rooms, live in number, through rows of servants, one each side of us, all sabled as well as 
the rooms. I never before understood that line of 
Pope's, 
</p><p>
" When Hopkins dies, a thousand lights attend." 
</p><p>
I believe there were two thousand here, for daylight was totally excluded. Upon the walls were as 
many escutcheons as candles. These are formed so 
as to place a light in each. These plates are all 
washed with silver ; being put upon the black cloth 
and lighted in this manner, they gave the rooms a 
tomb-like appearance ; for in this manner are the 
tombs of the dead enlightened in Catholic countries, 
and it is not uncommon for the great to leave a 
large sum of money for lights to be kept constantly 
burning. Through these rooms we moved, with a 
slow pace and a solemn silence, into that which 
contained the corpse. Here, upon a superb bed of 
state, surrounded with twenty-four wax lights upon 
enormous silver candlesticks, lay the remains of his 
Grace, as I presume, but so buried amidst stars and 
garters, and the various insignia of the different 
offices he sustained, that he might as well have 
been at Si on House, for all that one could see of 
him ; for these ornaments are displayed like flags, 
</p><p>
" The George and garter dangling from the bed, 
Where gaudy yellow strove with flaming red." 
</p><p>
Upon the bolster lay the ducal coronet, and round 
the bed stood a dozen men in black, whom they call 
mutes. It was said that the corpse was clothed in a 
white satin tunic, and cap richly trimmed with 
blonde lace ; but for this I cannot vouch, though I 
do not think it more ridiculous than the other parts 
of the parade which I saw ; and this farce was kept 
up two days. The body was then deposited in 
Westminster Abbey, with as much parade and show 
as possible ; but, being out of town, I did not see it. 
</p><p>
We made an excursion as far as <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, 
which lies about seventy-five miles from <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>. I 
was much disappointed in the appearance of the 
country, great part of it being only barren heath. 
Within eighteen miles of the town, it appears fruitful 
and highly cultivated. We spent only one day at 
<a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, but returned by another road, which 
brought us back through Windsor. Here we stopped 
a day and a half, and I was charmed and delighted 
with it. The most luxuriant fancy cannot exceed the 
beauties of this place. I do not wonder that Pope 
stvled it the seat of the muses. Read his " Windsor Forest," and give full credit to his most poetic 
flights. The road by which we entered the town 
was from the top of a very steep hill ; from this hill, 
a lawn presents itself on each side. Before you, a 
broad, straight road, three miles in length ; upon 
each side a double plantation of lofty elms lift their 
majestic heads, which is exceeded only by a view of 
the still grander forest, at a distance, which is thirty 
miles in circumference. From this hill you have a 
view of the Castle and the town. This place, as in 
former days, is the retreat of the monarch. The 
royal family reside here nine months of the year, 
not in the Castle, as that would require the attendance of ministers, &c. The present Queen has 
a neat lodge here, close to the Castle ; and there 
is another, a few rods distant, for the Princesses. 
His Majesty is a visiter to the Queen, and the family 
reside here with as little parade as that of a private 
gentleman. It is the etiquette, that none of his 
Majesty's ministers approach him upon business 
here. Despatches are sent by messengers, and 
answers returned in the same way. He holds his 
levees twice a week, in town. The Castle is one of 
the strongest places in Europe, as it is said, and a 
safe retreat for the family in case any more revolutions should shake this kingdom. It was first built 
by Edward the Third. Charles the Second kept 
his Court here during; the summer months, and 
spared no expense to render it worthy the royal 
residence. He furnished it richlv, and decorated it 
with paintings by the first masters. It is situated 
upon a high hill, which rises by a gentle ascent, 
and enjoys a most delightful prospect round it. In 
front is a wide and extensive vale, adorned with 
fields and meadows, with groves on either side, 
and the calm, smooth water of the Thames running 
through them. Behind it are hills, covered with 
fine forests, as if designed by nature for hunting. 
</p><p>
The terrace round the Castle is a noble walk, 
covered with fine gravel. It is raised on a steep declivity of a hill, and overlooks the whole town. 
Here the King and royal family walk on Sunday 
afternoons, in order to show themselves to those of 
their subjects who choose to repair to Windsor for 
that purpose. In fine weather the terrace is generally thronged. From the top of this tower on the 
Castle, they showed us thirteen different counties. 
To describe to you the apartments, the paintings 
and decorations within this Castle, would require a 
volume instead of a letter. I shall mention only 
two rooms ; and the first is that called the Queen's 
bed-chamber, where, upon the top of the ceiling, is 
painted the story of Diana and Endymion. The 
bed of state was put up by her Majesty ; the inside 
and counterpanes are of white satin, the curtains of 
pea green, richly embroidered by a Mrs. Wright, 
embroiderer to her Majesty. There is a full length 
picture of the Queen, with her fourteen children in 
miniature, in the same piece, taken by Mr. West. It 
is a very handsome likeness of her. The next room 
is called " the room of beauties " ; so named for the 
portraits of the most celebrated beauties in the reign 
of Charles the Second. They are fourteen in number. 
There is also Charles's Queen, a very handsome woman. The dress of many of them is in the style 
of the present day. Here is also Queen Caroline's 
china closet, filled with a great variety of curious 
china, elegantly disposed. 
</p><p>
I have come now to the bottom of the last page. 
If I have amused my dear niece, it will give great 
pleasure to her affectionate aunt, 
</p><p>
A. A.
