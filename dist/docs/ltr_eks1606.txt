ANCHORAGE OFF BRASOS, SANTIAGO, 
STEAMER " McKiM," 
</p><p>
September 30, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1846">1846</a>. 
</p><p>
It is early morning. We have lain here rolling in a 
heavy sea since yesterday. The lighter has just come 
off bringing news of a dreadful fight at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>. 
The steamer " James L. Day " is firing up inside to 
take the news to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a> and I hasten to give 
you what little news I have been able to gather. 
The fight commenced by an attack on the fortified 
heights near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> on the twenty-first, our forces 
gradually gaining on the enemy until the twenty- 
fourth, when General Ampudia capitulated. Our loss 
was terrible, that of the Mexicans not yet ascertained. 
On our side Captain L. N. Morris, Captain Field, 
Brevet Major Barbour, Lieutenant Irwin, Lieutenant 
Hazlitt, Lieutenant Wood, Captain McKavett, and 
Lieutenant Hoskins were killed and many other officers badly wounded. It is said there are five hundred 
of the rank and file killed and wounded. The Ten 
nessee volunteers suffered much. General Worth, it 
is reported, greatly distinguished himself. We know 
on board no other particulars, not even the terms of 
the capitulation. I could lie down and cry of vexation and grief at not being there, though perhaps it is 
all for the best and we shall have more fighting. . . .
