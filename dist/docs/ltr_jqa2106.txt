THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, June 4, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1796">1796</a>.

If the war by land be thus brought to a close, the whole 
force and attention of the French government will of course 
be turned towards the means of balancing the British naval 
force, and of assaulting the remaining antagonist in her only 
vulnerable part. For this purpose measures will perhaps 
be pursued to raise other maritime enemies against Great 
Britain. In Europe, the Italian States, Spain, Denmark, 
Sweden and even Hamburg and Bremen may be stimulated, 
in various manners to shut the Baltic and the Mediterranean 
against the British commerce, and it will best be known to 
you, Sir, whether inducements of a similar nature will be 
presented to the United States. I have understood that it 
was not long since in the contemplation of the Directory, to 
send out an envoy extraordinary with a special mission to 
America, but that this intention has since been laid aside. 
</p><p>
Upon my arrival here, I found an administration differently organized from that to which I was accredited, and 
even from that which I had left here the last autumn. The 
supreme authority of the republic is now held by a National 
Assembly, and the States General have been formally dis 
solved. . . . 
</p><p>
The president of the National Assembly for the time being 
is, under the present arrangements, ex officio, president of 
the Diplomatic Committee. I visited him of course immediately after my return. He announced the circumstance 
to the Assembly, who thereupon directed their agent [Slicher] to compliment me in their name upon my arrival, 
with the most cordial assurances of their regard and friend 
ship for the United States, which he accordingly did yesterday. . . .*
