Mr DEAR SIR I had devoted this day, before the 
going out of the post, to have written to you a long letter; but the great increase of my cold, has compelled me to a third bleeding, and has indisposed me so much 
that I shall be obliged to abridge this letter a good deal, I cannot fail to thank you for your favour of the twentyfourth ultimo, which came to hand on the fourth instant. 
You will please observe, in my last letter, I foretell, that the party would not agree to publish Dr. Lee's vindication." I know perfectly well, the principles on which 
these people act, so that, on most points, I would venture ten to one, on saying with certainty, how the set will 
vote. I am clearly of opinion, that if Mr. " Clearly-out-of-order," remains much longer in Congress, the United States will have cause to rue it bitterly. I am sure, 
that I have heard more talk about order, and seen less attention to it, in one week in that Assembly, since he became a member, than in four years preceding his 
coming in. You suppose I will get the vindication from 
the fountain; I believe so too, sir, were it not for the vice which is disseminated with the partners, in many parts of Virginia, and of France. A large 
packet came lately to me, robbed of its written papers, which, I can have no doubt, were in it; it was opened at one end, and directed in my brother's handwriting, 
Every delegate has a right to a copy; and can there be any impropriety (since the paper came directed to me] in a delegate furnishing me with a copy? As the public will, most inevitably, in time, be made acquainted 
with the proceedings of Congress in this affair, I wish most earnestly, for the honour of many gentlemen now there, that the journal may distinguish properly. To 
this end, when "order clearly" obstructs not, cannot a motion for publishing be made, and the ayes and nays be taken on it? The same on the question of making Deane 
give security for settling full and fair accounts. And the same indeed, on all questions relating to this man. You 
alarm me exceedingly, when you say u I do not at this instant see a man, &c.;" can it be, that the late commissioner can escape with applause! I would not for a thousand worlds have my name to such a vote. Infamy will certainly attend it to the latest posterity. I will pledge my life on this.

I take Captain Duarte, of the Portuguese Snow, to be the captain and vessel carried to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> by the privateer belonging to R. Morris and Carter Braxton. If 
so, and our Assembly are to determine any thing concerning it, it will be essentially necessary, that all the papers relative to the case, be sent to that body properly 
authenticated, and amongst others, Braxton's instructions to the captain of the privateer when he sailed on his cruise: I think this paper is among the Congress files. 
I shall thank you sir, for an authenticated copy of these instructions, as well as the resolve you allude to in your favour of the twenty-seventh. I am clearly of opinion 
with you, that if this affair is not properly adjusted in America, the injury to our cause in Europe, will be great; and, I believe, in my conscience, that some 
people, who hold their heads high in America, wish for this consequence. 
</p><p>
If you (as I hope you do) still determine to honour <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chantilly" rel="city">CHANTILLY</a> with your company as you travel to the south, I pray you, dear sir, to let me know two posts before you 
leave <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, that I may not be from home, for I should be extremely concerned were I to be absent on an event I wish so much should take place. I wish we 
may be so fortunate as to hear that the enemy have been compelled to abandon Georgia. If we meet with success in that quarter, surely our enemy will be compelled 
to equitable terms of peace next winter. But I will never call the loss of the fisheries, and the navigation of the Mississippi, equitable. And I am sure posterity 
will execrate those who do. I am not well, and must conclude. With my best wishes for your health and happiness, 
</p><p>
I am, my dear sir, your most affectionate friend, and obliged humble servant, 
</p><p>
