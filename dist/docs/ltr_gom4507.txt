Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Upon my return from Albany, it was at my request determined, that, instead of going to Springfield, I should repair to 
Head-Quarters. In consequence, with <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague friend met'>Mr Jay</a>, I went thither. 
Unfortunately we did not arrive at Philadelphia, until the day 
it had been determined to send <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>Gates</a> to take the command of 
the northern department. You will readily believe, that we 
were not pleased at this resolution, and I assure you for my 
own part, I felt exceedingly distressed at your removal, just 
when changing fortune began to declare in our favor. Congress, I hope, will perceive, that our successes have been owing 
to the judicious plans adopted previous to your removal. 
</p><p>
Our representations of your situation have obtained, as by 
this time you must be sensible, such reinforcement for the 
northern armies, as will enable <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>Gates</a> to act with eclat, if he 
has spirit and understanding sufficient for that purpose. His 
situation is certainly an eligible one. As his friend, I am pleased 
at the opportunity he has of acquiring honor, while I sincerely 
lament his possessing this opportunity at your expense. However, it was become necessary, for the eastern folks declared, 
that their people would not march while you had the command. In misfortunes, great minds rise superior to adversity, 
end this too, whether they are of a public or private nature. 
</p><p>
With that incautiousness natural to me, and of which I scorn 
to divest myself among my friends, let me say, that I think you 
will find it for your honor to resign, but in this, festina lente, 
the hour is not yet come. I wish you would direct the plan 
you think best for the northern armies, pointing out the posts 
necessary to he taken, the manosuvres to be made, and the like, 
which your intimate knowledge of the country enables you to 
do better than most men. It seems to me we should contrive 
to possess the height to the northward of Fort Edward, if it be 
practicable to maintain it, and then, by keeping parties around 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Burgoyne's army</a>, intercept his supplies, and force him to quit 
his post at Batten Kill. This is a reverie, but clearly something 
capital may be done ; perhaps he may be attacked with success 
in his lines. I am inclined to believe, that the unexpected sight 
of our troops, advancing with fixed bayonets without firing a shot, 
would so intimidate his soldiers, that they would not stand. 
But to the purpose. I could wish that having digested your 
plan, you would send it to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>Gates</a>, as the continuation of what 
you intended, if successful loathe eastward and westward, which, 
thank God, you have been. Introduce it to him under the idea, 
that you think it your duty to contribute to the success of the 
American arms, as well out of as in power, and send a copy of 
the whole to Congress, in which you may also, with great propriety, mention as a reason why you have not obeyed their order, that <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> was so long ou his journey, that the attention, which you were obliged to pay to the northern arrny, 
would not permit you to provide for yours. This, and Indian 
affairs, are good causes for your stay. I am, yours, 
</p><p>
