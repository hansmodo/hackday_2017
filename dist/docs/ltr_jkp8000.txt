My Dear Sir : I enclose you a letter from Mr. Bancroft, and will add, to what he has said, that the information from Mexico comes in so authentic a shape as to entitle it to entire credit. . . . 
</p><p>
You may consider me impatient on this subject. I do not consider that I am so, but still I have a great desire that what is contemplated should be done as soon as it may suit your convenience. I have felt great reluctance in saying this much, because I desired not to interfere with your arrangements during the short recreation which you have taken from your arduous labors. 
</p><p>
I am, very faithfully and truly, your friend, <a href="/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="me">James K. Polk</a>. 
</p><p>
P.S. â€” If you determine to anticipate the period of your return to Washington, you will see the propriety of leaving Bedford in a way to produce no public sensation as to the cause of 
your departure. That it may not be known that you leave on receiving a letter from me, I will not place my frank on this letter. 
</p><p>
Yours, etc., J. K. P.
