DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor to write your Excellency 
on the 26th ultimo, which I sent by the way of 
<a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. On the 4th instant I received the originals 
of the inclosed, except that marked Number Two, 
which came to hand yesterday. It chagrins me much, 
that I have not more frequent opportunities of ad 
dressing myself to you. 
</p><p>
I am extremely apprehensive that a want of powder will be fatal to our operations. I have sent Express to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, but have not yet learnt whether I shall be supplied or not. 
</p><p>
The army is now supplied with provisions to the 30th instant, but all the pork that is to be had is 
gone ; and although we have a sufficiency of fat cattle, I fear we shall want salt. 
</p><p>
I inclose your Excellency a return of the discharged men from this army. Exclusive of this, one 
hundred and fifty, at least, occupy the general hospital at Fort George, and I fear as many more are ready to enter it. 
</p><p>
I begin to gather strength ; my fever has left me, 
and I hope soon to be able to join the army. <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a></a>'s regiment, I suppose, will be this even ing at Fort George ; they will be pushed off immediately on their arrival here. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to make my best respects to General 
Lee, <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a>, and the gentlemen of your suite. 
I hope we shall all meet at a merry Christmas. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear General; my best wishes attend 
you through life, happy if I can have an opportunity 
of evincing how sincerely I am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=pjs" rel="me">PHILIP SCHUYLER</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. This moment your Excellency's despatches 
of the 4th came to hand. Captain Buell waits for 
this; can therefore only thank you for them.
