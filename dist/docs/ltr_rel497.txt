Honourable Reverdy Johnson,
</p><p>
United States Senate, Washington, D. C.
</p><p>
My Dear Sir:  My attention has been called to the official report of
the debate in the Senate of the United States, on the 19th instant,
in which you did my the kindness to doubt the correctness of the
statement made by the Honourable Simon Cameron, in regard to myself.
I desire that you may feel certain of my conduct on the occasion
referred to, so far as my individual statement can make you.  I never
intimated to any one that I desired the command of the United States
Army; nor did I ever have a conversation with but one gentleman, Mr.
Francis Preston Blair, on the subject, which was at his invitation,
and, as I understood, at the instance of President Lincoln.  After
listening to his remarks, I declined the offer that he made me, to
take command of the army that was to be brought into the field; stating,
as candidly and courteously as I could, that, though opposed to
secession and deprecating war, I could take no part in an invasion of
the Southern States.  I went directly from the interview with Mr. Blair
to the office of General Scott; told him of the proposition that had
been made to me, and my decision.  Upon reflection after returning
to my home, I concluded that I ought no longer to retain the commission
I held in the United States Army, and on the second morning thereafter
I forwarded my resignation to General Scott.  At the time, I hoped
that peace would have been preserved; that some way would have been
found to save the country from the calamities of war; and I then had
no other intention than to pass the remainder of my life as a private
citizen.  Two days afterward, upon the invitation of the Governor of
Virginia, I repaired to Richmond; found that the Convention then in
session had passed the ordinance withdrawing the State from the Union;
and accepted the commission of commander of its forces, which was
tendered me.
</p><p>
These are the ample facts of the case, and they show that Mr. Cameron
has been misinformed.
</p><p>
I am with great respect,
</p><p>
                     Your obedient servant,
</p>
