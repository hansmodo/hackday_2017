<a rel='month origin' value='12'>December</a> <a rel='day origin' value='1'>1st</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. At Coosawhatchie Yankees are landing in great force. Our troops down there are raw militia, old 
men and boys never under fire before ; some college cadets, in all a mere handful. The cradle and the grave have been 
robbed by us, they say. <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> goes to Savannah and not to Augusta.
