About half-past nine, as we got up from the breakfast table, a guerrilla told us the ram Arkansas was 
lying a few miles below, on her way to cooperate with Breckinridge, whose advance guard had already 
driven the pickets into <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>. Then we all grew wild with excitement. 
</p><p>
Such exclamations ! such delight that the dreadful moment had at last arrived ! And yet you could 
see each stop as we rejoiced, to offer up a prayer for 
the preservation of those who were risking their 
lives at that moment. Reason, and all else, was 
thrown aside, and we determined to participate in 
the danger, if there was any to be incurred. Mother 
threatened us with shot and shell and bloody murder, 
but the loud report of half a dozen cannon in slow 
succession only made us more determined to see the 
fun, so Lilly Nolan and Miss Walters got on horse 
back, and Phillie, Ginnie, Miriam, and I started off 
in the broiling sun, leaving word for the carriage to 
overtake us. When we once got in, the driver, being 
as crazy as we, fairly made his horses run along the 
road to catch a glimpse of our Ram. When, miles 
below, she came in sight, we could no longer remain 
in the carriage, but mounted the levee, and ran along 
on foot until we reached her, when we crossed to 
the outer levee, and there she lay at our feet. 
</p><p>
And nothing in her after all ! There lay a heavy, 
clumsy, rusty, ugly flatboat with a great square box 
in the centre, while great cannon put their noses out 
at the sides, and in front. The decks were crowded 
with men, rough and dirty, jabbering and hastily 
eating their breakfast. That was the great Arkansas ! 
God bless and protect her, and the brave men she 
carries. 
While there, a young man came up, and in answer 
to Phillie's inquiries about her father who, having gone to town yesterday to report, being paroled, 
had written last night to say no passes were granted 
to leave town the young fellow informed her so 
pleasantly that her father was a prisoner, held as 
hostage for Mr. Castle. Poor Phillie had to cry; so, 
to be still more agreeable, he told her, Yes, he had 
been sent to a boat lying at the landing, and ran the 
greatest risk, as the ram would probably sink the said 
boat in a few hours. How I hated the fool for his 
relish of evil tidings ! 
</p><p>
But never mind our wild expedition, or what came 
of it. Am I not patient ! Ever since I commenced to 
write, the sound of a furious bombardment has been 
ringing in my ears ; and beyond an occasional run to 
see the shells fly through the air (their white smoke, 
rather) I have not said a word of it. The girls have 
all crowded on the little balcony up here, towards 
town, and their shrieks of " There it goes!" "Lis 
ten!" "Look at them!" rise above the sound of the 
cannon, and occasionally draw me out, too. But I sit 
here listening, and wonder which report precedes the 
knocking down of our home; which shell is killing 
some one I know and love. Poor Tiche and Dophy ! 
where are they? And oh, I hope they did not leave 
my birdie Jimmy to die in his cage. I charged them 
to let him loose if they could not carry him. Dophy 
will be so frightened. I hope they are out of danger. 
Oh, my dear home! shall I ever see you again? And 
the Brunots! Oh, how I hope they are safe. These 
loud cannon make me heartsick, and yet I am so 
excited! How rapidly they answer each other! I am 
told the attack commenced at five this morning, 
and lasted three hours. Those girls are shouting that 
<a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> must be on fire, from the volume of 
smoke in that direction. How they scream as the 
balls go up, to show it to each other. I think I'll 
take a look, too. 
</p><p>
We are all going four or five miles through this warm sun to be nearer the scene of action. Any one 
might know there was no white man on the premises. 
There is the carnage! Oh, I am so seasick! What will I be before we get back?
