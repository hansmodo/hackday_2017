DEAR CLARA:
</p><p>
Your letter, with one from your Aunt Jennie, reached me a few days
since. I regret that I have not more cheerful news to write you than I
have. Financially the Grant family is ruined for the present, and by
the most stupendous frauds ever perpetrated. But your Aunt Jennie must
not fret over it. I still have a home and as long as I live she shall
enjoy it as a matter of right; at least until she recovers what she has
lost. Fred is young, active, honest, and intelligent, and will work
with a vim to recuperate his losses. Of course his first effort will be
to repay his aunts.--We go to Long Branch this week. We expected to
live with Fred this summer in Morristown, N.J. But failing to rent our
cottage we will occupy it and Fred will live with us and rent his if he
can.
</p><p>
All send love to you, your father and mother and Aunt Jennie.
</p><p>
Yours affectionately,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.
