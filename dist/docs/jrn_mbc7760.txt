<a rel='month origin' value='1'>January</a> <a rel='day origin' value='16'>16th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. My husband is at home once more for 
how long, I do not know. His aides fill the house, and a group of hopelessly wounded haunt the place. The drilling 
and the marching go on outside. It rains a flood, with freshet after freshet. The forces of nature are befriending 
us, for our enemies have to make their way through swamps.

A month ago my husband wrote me a letter which I promptly suppressed after showing it to Mrs. McCord. He warned us to make ready, for the end had come. Our resources were exhausted, and the means of resistance could 
not be found. We could not bring ourselves to believe it, and now, he thinks, with the railroad all blown up, the 
swamps made impassable by the freshets, which have no time to subside, so constant is the rain, and the negroes utterly 
apathetic (would they be so if they saw us triumphant?), if we had but an army to seize the opportunity we might do 
something; but there are no troops; that is the real trouble.

To-day Mrs. McCord exchanged $16,000 in Confederate bills for $300 in gold sixteen thousand for three hundred.
