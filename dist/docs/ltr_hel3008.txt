DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have had the honor of presenting, to as many 
members of Congress as have been convened in this 
city since the adjournment from <a href='/results.php?city=york' rel='city'>York</a>, your Excellency's several favors, of the 28th and 30th of June, 
and 1st instant, and, at their special instance, have 
caused them to be printed, for the information of the 
public. 
</p><p>
I arrived here on Tuesday last, but hitherto have 
not collected a sufficient number of States to form a 
Congress; consequently I have received no commands. 
Your Excellency will therefore be pleased to accept 
this as the address of an individual, intended to assure 
you, Sir, of my hearty congratulations with my countrymen on the success of the American arms, under 
your Excellency's immediate command, in the late 
battle of Momnouth, and more particularly of my own 
happiness in the additional glory achieved by your Excellency in retrieving the honor of these States in 
the moment of an alarming dilemma. 
</p><p>
It is not my design to attempt encomiums upon 
your Excellency. I am as unequal to the task as 
the act is unnecessary. Love and respect for your Excellency is impressed on the heart of every grateful American, and your name will be revered by posterity. Our acknowledgments are especially due to 
Heaven for the preservation of your Excellency's per 
son, necessarily exposed, for the salvation of America, 
to the most imminent danger in the late action. That 
the same hand may at all times guide and shield 
your Excellency, is the fervent wish of, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your much obliged and faithful humble servant, 
</p><p>
