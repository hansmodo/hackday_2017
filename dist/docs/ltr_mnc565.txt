I was much gratified & surprised my dear Mrs Glenn to receive your kind note this morning - 
Your generous gift which I accept as a testimonial of your old friendship which I have never forgotten 
but in these long sad years have often enquired after you & yours- I only hope that you have not inconvenienced 
yourself in your kindness to me May the Almighty return into your own bosom what you & so many noble souls 
in Baltimore have done for our unhappy South. I expect to join my <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="spouse met">husband</a > 
at Lexington on Tuesday next & have been prevented doing so before by the delays he has experienced in preparing 
the house for our reception We shall at least have a house for the present thus I feel 
(Page 2) much like an exile until I get back to my beloved Arlington. I should be very glad to hear from you at Lexington & tell me about all your family & our friends in Baltimore & if you have heard any thing of Mrs Stiles - The girls unite with me in much love to you & all yours
</p><p>
Affectionately yr friend
