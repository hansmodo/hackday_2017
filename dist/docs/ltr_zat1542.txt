My Dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your letter of yesterday came to hand this morning & I can truly 
say no one does or can possibly take a deeper interest in all that concerns 
yourself & family than I do, & am therefore concerned at the way you 
seem to look on matters & events which you cannot control, & which if 
indulged in, must result so injuriously to you & yours ; it is a long very 
long road that has no turn in it ; & I am pretty well satisfied that patience 
& perseverance will enable most of us to accomplish what we determine 
on be it what it may

The leave of absence asked for for Russell was promptly given & 
the order for the same sent to Fort Polk on the 21st   ins c under cover to 
Majr Munroe & I am only surprised it was not rec d but presume it has 
been done ere this ; if however it has been mislaid, the Dr can leave the 
first good opportunity, & a duplicate of the order shall be sent him to 
any place he designates. A few papers was sent up to me night before 
last from Fort Polk, but nothing beyond <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a>, & not even a scrape 
of a pen from there in the way of letters from any quarter. The principal matter of interest contained in the papers is the ordering Gen Gaines 1 
to Washington, the correspontence between the Secretary of War & 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> in relation to the latter taking com d of this army, which correspondence <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">the President</a> thought proper to lay before congress in a 
message ; all of which I presume you have seen ; Gen S. it appears 
threw some objections in the way of coming here as he did, not liked to 
be fired on at the same time by the Mexicans in his front, & by persons 
in high places in his rear ; a most unfortunate letter, which induced the 
president to relieve him from the com d to which he had been assigned, & 
from the danger of being fired on from the front, or in the rear ; this 
indiscreet letter of the Gen will have the effect to prostrate him most 
effectually, & will have or I am very much mistaken to blight his prospects most effectually for the presidency, which he has been looking for 
ward to with a longing eye for many years. At any rate I deeply regret 
his course on several acct s first it has had the effect to place me, or rather 
to keep me in my present command, which I by no means desires as my 
private affairs require my presence & attention, which ought not to be 
neglected, longer than towards the close of the present year ; besides I 
want quiet, & should have it at my time of life Besides I greatly fear 
the campaign will be a failure which will break down the individual who 
conducts it The Q r M dep t or those who compose it 1 are not adequate to furnish the necessary transportation, provisions, ammunition &c ; 
and I begin to doubt their willing in some quarters to do so ; but let my 
sacrifices be what they may as well as the course of others be ever so 
reprehensible, if the go 1 think proper to entrust me with this command 
for the purpose of carrying the war into the enemies country I do not 
feel authorized to decline the same, but will without faltering on the way, 
do all in my power to meet the views & expectations of those who confided in me, as well as the expectations of my friends
