THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, December 2, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1794">1794</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR : 
</p><p>
In my last letter I informed you of the opinion that was 
gaining ground in public, that a peace would be speedily 
effected, and of the occurrences generally known upon which 
that opinion was founded. Its prevalence was in no respect 
more distinguishable than in its different effects upon the 
spirits of the two parties in this country. The countenances 
of the Orangists and of the Patriots had undergone a reciprocal change. Their conversation betrayed symptoms of 
the same revolution. From the dejection of impotence and 
despair, the formerly suddenly assumed a degree of confidence and assurance as great as victory itself could have 
inspired, and some of them with a significancy of nod and shrug, and all the grimace of mystery, hinted that peace 
was certainly negotiating at that moment, and the terms were so far settled and agreed on that the present ruling 
power in this country was perfectly secure. On the other hand the Patriots, by whom the arrival of the French is 
expected much more ardently and more devoutly wished 
than the Messiah by the children of Abraham, began to 
tremble and falter, and manifestly to discover their fears 
of being abandoned by their promised deliverers. It was 
said that Sweden and Denmark were to be jointly the mediators between the belligerent powers, but the Orangists were 
in too great haste for peace to think of the forms and niceties 
of a mediation. In a numerous party composed of persons 
of this description at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, I heard more than one 
of them express a great contempt for the idea of a mediation, and affirm that the powers interested in the event would 
easily settle their differences, without the intervention of 
any mediator. The unexpected prorogation of the British 
Parliament was considered as full proof that the Ministry 
of that country had determined to negotiate, and as to any 
difficulty arising on the part of France, it scarcely appears 
to enter their minds in the form of a possibility. 
</p><p>
The next report was that the mediation was to be from the 
United States, and that Mr. Jay was already commissioned 
for the purpose. 
</p><p>
I last evening returned the visit of the Minister of Portugal, which he had made me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>. Speaking 
upon the subject of peace he said it was in the power of this country to obtain it. She had only to speak the word, and 
it would be done. I said it did not appear an easy thing to me for the States General to make peace without the 
consent of Great Britain. But, said he, they can if they please compel that consent. I do not see how they could, 
but I did not press the conversation on that point any further. I told him I had heard much of the mediation of 
Sweden and Denmark. "Yes," said he, "and you Americans are to be concerned in the business too." I told 
him, that on Mr. Jay's first arrival in England there had been a report of his being employed for such an affair, and 
that since his signing the treaty with Lord Grenville it had 
been revived. But I had not believed it then, and do not 
believe it now. He said that there certainly had been some 
kind of proposals made to Mr. Jay on the subject, implying 
that they came from the British Ministry. "But," added 
he, "that Ministry have in reality no thoughts of peace; 
they mean to amuse and delude and gain time, but nothing 
more. They are absolutely bent upon another campaign. 
They will pretend to enter upon negotiations and to listen 
to terms, but it will all come to nothing. The Emperor is, 
indeed, extremely desirous of peace, but he will not make it 
without the consent of Great Britain. He will therefore 
make one feeble, ineffectual campaign more." 
</p><p>
As this conversation was neither official nor confidential, 
you will justly appreciate the dependence to be placed in the 
opinion thus expressed. I have thought it my duty to give 
it you as accurately as I am able, especially as it concerns in 
some measure the United States themselves. 
</p><p>
The determination of the British Ministry to pursue the 
war is now public, and the Orangists again begin to droop 
the head, and speak of mediation as a desirable thing. 
</p><p>
I am not of the opinion of the gentleman of Portugal, that 
peace is so much within the power of this country; they 
cannot even abandon their allies and become their enemies, 
without extreme danger to themselves. Thirty thousand 
British troops are upon their territory; though unable to 
resist the progress of the enemy they are amply competent 
to the destruction of their friends, and what apprehensions 
arc to be entertained as to the avowed hostility of those whose 
very protection is dreaded like a pestilence? 
</p><p>
The magistracy of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> notwithstanding their 
severity against the presenters of the famous petition had 
come to a resolution, as I am told, not to admit foreign troops 
into their city. A few days since a body of 1500 men from 
the English army appeared before Delft. Their presence 
was so much deprecated by the inhabitants that the gates 
were shut against them, and the magistracy, yielding to the 
popular impulse, resolved that they should not be admitted 
into the city. The Duke of York has been expected here 
since yesterday and has I presume arrived. The only ground 
of his visit that I have heard mentioned is that he comes to 
complain of the exclusion given to his troops at Delft, and 
to obtain a counter order and satisfaction in this respect. 
It is not probable that the force of the popular sentiment will 
stand against the uncontrolled dominion of the British 
influence. . . .
