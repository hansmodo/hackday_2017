Sir, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your Excellency's letter of this 
date respecting the preparations to be made for the 
next campaign. The reason of my stay at the North 
River I mentioned in my letter from thence. As 
soon as I obtained the returns in that quarter, I 
came away. A general return is forming, which, from 
the multiplicity of articles, will be voluminous; but, 
as soon as possible, I will complete and lay it before 
your Excellency. In the mean time, I beg leave to 
submit to your consideration some things which need 
not wait the completion of the return, but on which, 
from their nature and capital importance, an early 
decision seems requisite. 
On considering the mode most proper to be adopted 
in providing ox-teams for the ensuing campaign, the 
Secretary of War and I were decidedly in favor of 
purchasing them. I have since formed the inclosed 
estimate, number One, showing the comparative expenses of hiring and purchasing the necessary number of ox-teams, in which your Excellency will see 
on what foundation our opinion rested. Tents being 
the most expensive and essential articles of camp 
equipage, I extracted from the returns, then in my 
hands, the numbers on which we might rely for the 
ensuing campaign. The Secretary of War, on a cursory view, supposed these numbers would be sufficient. The same extract, a copy of which, number 
Two, is inclosed, shows the state of the knapsacks, 
canteens, &c., at the times mentioned therein. On 
comparing this with my estimate of last year, I think 
nothing more needs be purchased, at least for the present, except knapsacks, canteens, and camp-kettles. 
I was apprehensive that the canteens at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, in 
September, might afterwards have been transported to 
Claverack, and they are an article so frequently lost 
and broken, I concluded with the Secretary of War, 
that six thousand more should be procured in Massachusetts, to be brought on by the teams raised for 
the army ; and I sent orders accordingly to my deputy there by him.

Number Three, is a return of the public boats in 
the North River. On the back of it I have noted 
the number and species of private vessels on the same 
river, and the amount of their tonnage. But, as they 
have run during the winter, and been ill-prepared, 
probably not more than half of them will be fit for service The ensuing season. I procured this information, as I thought it might be of use, if a question 
should arise, whether the gun-boats and other public 
vessels there should be repaired. 
</p><p>
Number Four contains the terms on which Mr. Sheafe, the superintendent at Wappen's Creek, will 
perform the ship and boatWright's work therein mentioned. Number Five is an estimate of a company 
of artificers, which I apprehend will be necessary in 
the main army the ensuing campaign. Should the 
operations of the army in the State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> require a greater number, I persuade myself it will 
be easy to engage them for the occasion. On the 
terms stated, I find the company can be raised. I 
left orders with the Commissary of Forage to form a 
magazine sufficient for the posts in the Highlands 
until the first of May, which, if the snow continues, 
I expect will be done. I have contracted with the 
smith at Newburg for all the smiths' work necessary 
for the main army during the next campaign, if I 
choose to continue the contract so long. Its continuance will, of course, depend on the aid which can be 
derived from the Superintendent of Finance. The 
terms are lower than any smiths in this city will engage on. It was the desire of the Secretary at War, 
that your Excellency's determination relative to the 
ox-teams, might be by me communicated to him before he should leave Massachusetts. I have the honor 
to be, with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,
