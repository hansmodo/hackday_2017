It is astonishing what a quantity of fresh air has been consumed by me since I formed that wise resolution. The supply must be largely increased, to keep 
up with the demand ; perhaps that is the cause of all 
these clouds and showers ; I must be making a severe 
drain on the economy of heaven. From breakfast to 
dinner I remain on the balcony, and read aloud 
several chapters of the "Memoires" of Dumas, by 
way of practice. A dictionary lies by me, and I suffer 
no word to pass without a perfect definition. Then 
comes my French grammar, which I study while 
knitting or sewing, which takes very nearly until 
dinner-time. After that, I do as I please, either 
reading or talking, until sunset when we can ride or 
walk ; the walk being always sweetened with sugar 
cane. The evening we always spend on the balcony. 
Is that grand air enough? mon teint! je serai joliment brune !

We three girls occupy the same room, since Gibbes's arrival, and have ever so much fun and not 
half enough sleep. I believe the other two complain 
of me as the cause; but I plead not guilty. I never 
was known to laugh aloud, no matter how intense 
might have been my mirth; "it won't come," as Gibbes murmured last night while reading aloud Artemus Ward's last letter, when we discovered it 
was suppressed laughter, rather than suppressed 
pain, that caused him to writhe so. On the other 
hand, Anna and Miriam laugh as loud and lustily as 
daughters of the Titans if the respectable gentle 
men had daughters. I confess to doing more than 
half the talking, but as to the laugh that follows, not 
a bit. Last night I thought they would go wild, and 
I too laughed myself into silent convulsions, when I 
recited an early effusion of my poetic muse for their 
edification. Miriam made the bedstead prance, 
fairly, while Anna's laugh sounded like a bull of Bashan with his head in a bolster case.
