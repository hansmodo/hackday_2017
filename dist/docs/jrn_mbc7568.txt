<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a rel='month origin' value='6'>June</a> <a rel='day origin' value='27'>27</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>. Mr. Meynardie was perfect in the part of traveling companion. He had 
his pleasures, too. The most pious and eloquent of parsons is human, and he enjoyed the converse of the 
" eminent persons " who turned up on every hand and gave their views freely on all matters of state.

Mr. Lawrence Keitt joined us en route. With him came his wife and baby. We don't think alike, but Mr. Keitt 
is always original and entertaining. Already he pronounces Jeff Davis a failure and his Cabinet a farce. 
" Prophetic, " I suggested, as he gave his opinion before the administration had fairly got under way. He was 
fierce in his fault-finding as to Mr. Chesnut's vote for Jeff Davis. He says Mr. Chesnut overpersuaded the Judge, 
and those two turned the tide, at least with the South Carolina delegation. We wrangled, as we always do. He says 
Howell Cobb's common sense might have saved us.

Two quiet, unobtrusive Yankee school-teachers were on the train. I had spoken to them, and they had told me all 
about themselves. So I wrote on a scrap of paper, " Do not abuse our home and house so before these Yankee 
strangers, going North. Those girls are schoolmistresses returning from whence they came. 
</p><p>
Soldiers everywhere. They seem to be in the air, and certainly to fill all space. Keitt quoted a funny Georgia 
man who says we try our soldiers to see if they are hot enough before we enlist them. If, when water is thrown 
on them they do not sizz, they won't do ; their patriotism is too cool. 
</p><p>
To show they were wide awake and sympathizing enthusiastically, every woman from every window of every 
house we passed waved a handkerchief, if she had one. This fluttering of white flags from every side never ceased from 
Camden to Richmond. Another new symptom parties of girls came to every station simply to look at the troops 
passing. They always stood (the girls, I mean) in solid phalanx, and as the sun was generally in their eyes, they 
made faces. Mary Hammy never tired of laughing at this peculiarity of her sister patriots.

At the depot in Richmond, Mr. Mallory, with Wigfall and Garnett, met us. We had no cause to complain of the 
warmth of our reception. They had a carriage for us, and our rooms were taken at the Spotswood. But then the people who were in the rooms engaged for us had not departed at the time they said they were going. They lingered among 
the delights of Richmond, and we knew of no law to make them keep their words and go. Mrs. Preston had gone for 
a few days to Manassas. So we took her room. <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> 
is as kind as ever. She met us in one of the corridors accidentally, and asked us to join her party and to take our 
meals at her table. Mr. Preston came, and we moved into a room so small there was only space for a bed, wash-stand, 
and glass over it. My things were hung up out of the way on nails behind the door.

As soon as my husband heard we had arrived, he came, too. After dinner he sat smoking, the solitary chair of the 
apartment tilted against the door as he smoked, and my poor dresses were fumigated. I remonstrated feebly. 
" War times, " said he; " nobody is fussy now. When I go back to Manassas to-morrow you will be awfully sorry 
you snubbed me about those trumpery things up there." So he smoked the pipe of peac"e, for I knew that his remarks were painfully true. As soon as he was once more under the enemy's guns, I would repent in sackcloth and ashes.

Captain Ingraham came with Colonel Lamar. The latter said he could only stay five minutes; he was obliged 
to go back at once to his camp. That was a little before eight. However, at twelve he was still talking to us on 
that sofa. We taunted him with his fine words to the the F. F. V. crowd before the Spotswood : Virginia has 
no grievance. She raises her strong arm to catch the blow aimed at her weaker sisters." He liked it well, how 
ever, that we knew his speech by heart. 
</p><p>
This Spotswood is a miniature world. The war topic is not so much avoided, as that everybody has some personal dignity to take care of and everybody else is indifferent to it. I mean the " personal dignity of " autrui. In 
this wild confusion everything likely and unlikely is told you, and then everything is as flatly contradicted. At any 
rate, it is safest not to talk of the war.

Trescott was telling us how they laughed at little South Carolina in Washington. People said it was almost as 
large as Long Island, which is Hardly more than a tail-feather of New York. Always there is a child who sulks 
and won't play; that was our role. And we were posing as San Marino and all model-spirited, though small, republics, pose. 
</p><p>
He tells us that <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a> is a humorist. <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a> sees the fun of things ; he thinks if they had left us in a corner 
or out in the cold a while pouting-, with our fingers in our mouth, by hook or by crook he could have got us back, but 
Anderson spoiled all. 
</p><p>
In <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis's</a> drawing-room last- night, the President took a seat by me orLjthe sofa where I sat. He talked for 
nearly an hour. He laughed at our faith in our own powers. We are like the British. We think every Southerner 
equal to three Yankees at least. We will have to be equivalent to a dozen now. After his experience of the fighting 
qualities of Southerners in Mexico, he believes that we will do all that can foe- done,. by pluck and muscle, endurance, 
and dogged courage, dash, and red-hot patriotism. And yet his tone was not sanguine. There was a sad refrain 
running through it all. For one thing, either way, he thinks it will be a long war. That floored me at once. It 
has been too long for me already. Then he said, before the end came we would have many a bitter experience. He said 
only fools doubted the courage of the Yankees, or their willingness to fight when they saw fit. And now that we 
have stung their pride, we have roused them till they will fight like devils.

Mrs. Bradley Johnson is here, a regular heroine. She out-generaled the Governor of North Carolina in some way 
and has got arms and clothes and ammunition for her husband's regiment. There was some joke. The regimental 
breeches were all wrong, but a tailor righted that hind part before, or something odd.

Captain Hartstein came to-day with Mrs. Bartow. 
Colonel Bartow is Colonel of a Georgia regiment now in Virginia. He was the Mayor of Savannah who helped to 
wake the patriotic echoes the livelong night under my sleepless head into the small hours in Charleston in November last. His wife is a charming person, witty and wise, daughter of Judge Berrieh. She had on a white muslin 
apron with pink bows on the pockets. It gave her a gay and girlish air, and yet she must be as old as I am.

Mr. Lamar, who does not love slavery more than Sumner does, nor than I do, laughs at the compliment New England 
pays us. We want to separate from them ; to be rid of the Yankees forever at any price. And they hate us so, and 
would clasp us, or grapple us, as Polonius has it, to their bosoms with hooks of steel. We are an unwilling bride. 
I think incompatibility of temper began when it was made plain to us that we got all the opprobrium of slavery and 
they all the money there was in it with their tariff. 
</p><p>
Mr. Lamar says, the young men are light-hearted be cause there is a fight on hand, but those few who look 
ahead, the clear heads, they see all the risk, the loss of land, limb, and life, home, wife, and children. As in the brave 
days of old," they take to it for their country's sake. They are ready and willing, come what may. But not so 
light-hearted as the jeunesse doree.
