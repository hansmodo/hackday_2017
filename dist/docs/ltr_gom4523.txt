My Dear Friend, 
</p><p>
I have received yours of the third of February, and reply shortly, that I may reply immediately. My reason for which 
is, that I am told that the London Gazetteers have killed me, besides burning my house, and other little pleasantries of the 
same kind. Now as these accounts may be republished, I apprize you thereof, and pray you to vouch, that it was not 
true at the time of publication. 
</p><p>
You tell me that, in my place, you would resign and come home ; but this is not quite so easily done as said. In the 
first place, I must have leave to resign from the President ; but further, you will consider that the very circumstances, 
which you mention, are strong reasons for abiding, because it is not permitted to abandon a post in the hour of difficulty. 
T think the late decrees respecting our commerce will show you, that my continuance here has not been without some 
use to the United States. I am always and truly yours, 
</p><p>
