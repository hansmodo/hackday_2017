DEAR SIR, Your favor of May came to hand a few days 
ago. It is fortunate that the variant ideas have been so easily 
accommodated touching the mode of surveying and selling the 
territorial fund. It will be equally so, I think, if you can dispossess the British of the Western posts before the land office 
is opened. On this event and the navigation of the Mississippi 
will much depend the fiscal importance of the back country to 
the United States. The amount of the proposed requisition 
will, I fear, startle those to whom it will be addressed. The 
use of certificates as a medium for discharging the interest of 
the home debt is a great evil, though I suppose a necessary 
one. The advantage it gives to Sharpers and Collectors can 
scarcely be described, and what is more noxious, it provokes 
violations of public faith more than the weight of the Burden 
itself. The 1,000,000 dollars to be paid in specie, and the 
greatest part of it to be sent abroad, will equally try the virtue 
of the States. If they do not flinch, however, they will have 
the satisfaction of coming out of the trial with more honor, 
though with less money.

I have lately heard that the Kentucky Delegates will be instructed to propose to the next session the separation of that 
Country from this, and its being handed over to Congress for 
admission into the Confederacy. If they pursue their object 
through this channel, they will not only accomplish it without 
difficulty, but set a useful example to other "Western settlements 
which may chuse to be lopped off from other States. My information as to this matter is not authentic, but such as I am 
inclined to believe true. I hear, also, that a State is actually 
set up in the back country of North Carolina, that it is organized, named, and has deputed representatives to Congress. 
</p><p>
It gives me much pleasure to observ.by 2 printed reports 
sent me by Col. Grayson, that, in the latter, Congress had expunged a clause contained in the first, for setting apart a district of land in each Township for supporting the Religion of 
the majority of inhabitants. How a regulation so unjust in 
itself, so foreign to the authority of Congress, so hurtful to the 
sale of the public land, and smelling so strongly of an antiquated Bigotry, could have received the countenance of a Committee, is truly matter of astonishment. In one view it might 
have been no disadvantage to this State, in case the General 
Assessment should take place, as it would have given a repellent quality to the new Country in the estimation of those whom 
our own encroachments on Religious liberty would be calculated to banish to it. But the adversaries to the assessment 
begin to think the prospect here flattering to their wishes. The 
printed bill has excited great discussion, and is likely to prove 
the sense of the community to be in favor of the liberty now 
enjoyed. I have heard of several Counties where the late representatives have been laid aside for voting for the Bill, and 
not of a single one where the reverse has happened. The Presbyterian Clergy, too, who were in general friends to the scheme, 
are already in another tone, either compelled by the laity of 
that sect, or alarmed at the probability of further interferences 
of the Legislature if they once begin to dictate in matters of 
Religion. 
I am, dear sir, your's affectionately.
