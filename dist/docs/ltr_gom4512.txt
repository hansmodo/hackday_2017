Dear General 
</p><p>
I have a word to say to you on the subject of promotion, 
which we have just now finished, or rather unfinished, at least 
if that matter was before in an unfinished situation. That famous incomprehensible Baltimore resolution, introduced, unluckily perhaps, a very tedious debate, which terminated at 
length by rejecting the whole of what the committee reported, 
with relation to the promoting of officers. You may be a 
little surprised, when I tell you, that upon the whole matter I 
believe this is best. But how ? It is true, I confess, that 
much ground of heart-burning is left, under the Baltimore 
resolution governing these matters by the mysterious trinity of 
seniority, merit, and quota. 
</p><p>
Let me, however, on the other hand observe, that to tie up 
the hands of the republic as to the officers, whom they are to 
appoint, is utterly inconsistent with the republican principles of 
government, which ought to prevail among us. No danger, 
it .is true, can arise at present ; but, my dear Sir, we are laying 
foundations, and how posterity in future wars may build on 
the foundations laid by ancestors, whom they will certainly 
reverence, no man can be hardy enough to assert. What 
then, you will say, is the effect of the new rule? Tn my 
poor opinion it is no rule. What then is the use of the 
resolution ? Nothing more, than an apology for officers, whom 
it may be found necessary to supersede. 
</p><p>
Congress, in effect, seem to have pledged themselves to 
their constitutents, that they will pay a due attention in the 
quota of troops furnished by the States respectively to the seniority of the several officers, and to that degree of military abilities, which nature or industry may have conferred upon deserving individuals. You ask me what is to be the rule of promotion below the degree of a general officer. I answer, that Congress could not with propriety make any rule. They 
have given to the States the power of appointing the officers 
in their own regiments; consequently it would be idle to restrict them, as to the persons whom they shall appoint. It will, 
therefore, be necessary to make application to the several 
States on the occasion. They have already, I believe, in 
most instances given you the necessary power, and if so, then 
to fix the order of promotion will only be a limitation of such 
power. I am, dear General, most sincerely yours, 
</p><p>
