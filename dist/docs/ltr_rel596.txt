<p><i>[Biographer's note: Spending the summer on the Pamunkey at the White House, exposed all
day in the fields to the sun, and at night to the malaria from the
river and marshes, I became by the last of September one continuous
chill, so it was decided that, as the corn was made, the fodder
saved, the wheat land broken up, and hands not so greatly needed, I
should get a furlough.  Mounting my mare, I started on a visit to my
mother and sisters, hoping that the change to the upper country would
help me to get rid of the malaria.  When I reached Derwent my father
had gone to Lexington, but my mother and the rest were there to welcome
me and dose me for my ailments.  There was still some discussion among
us all as to what was the best thing for me to do, and I wrote to my
father, telling him of my preference for a farmer's life and my desire
to work my own land.  The following letter, which he wrote me in reply,
is, like all I ever got from him, full of love, tenderness, and good,
sensible advice:]</i>

My Dear Son:  I did not receive until yesterday your letter of the
8th inst.  I regret very much having missed seeing you--still more to
hear that you have been suffering from intermittent fever.  I think
the best thing you can do is to eradicate the disease from your system,
and unless there is some necessity for your returning to the White
House, you had better accompany your mother here.  I have thought very
earnestly as to your future.  I do not know to what stage your education
has been carried, or whether it would be advantageous for you to pursue
it further.  Of that you can judge.  If you do, and will apply yourself
so as to get the worth of your money, I can advance it to you for
this year at least.  If you do not, and wish to take possession of your
farm, I can assist you a little in that.  As matters now stand, you
could raise money on your farm only by mortgaging it, which would put
you in debt at the beginning of your life, and I fear in the end would
swallow up all your property.  As soon as I am restored to civil rights,
if I ever am, I will settle up your grandfather's estate, and put you
in possession of your share.  The land may be responsible for some
portion of his debts or legacies.  If so, you will have to assume it.
In the meantime, I think it would be better for you, if you determine
to farm your land, to go down there as you propose and begin on a
moderate scale.  I can furnish you means to buy a team, wagon,
implements, etc.  What will it cost?  If you cannot wait to accompany
your mother here, come up to see me and we can talk it over.  You could
come up in the packet and return again.  If you do come, ask Agnes
for my box of private papers I left with her, and bring it with you;
but do not lose it for your life, or we are all ruined.  Wrap it up
with your clothes and put it in a carpet-bat or valise, so that you
can keep it with you or within your sight, and do not call attention
to it.  I am glad to hear that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfl" rel="child met">Fitzhugh</a> keeps so well, and that he
is prospering in his farming operations.  Give him a great deal of
love for me.  The first thing you must do is to get well.
</p><p>
                  Your affectionate father,
</p><p>
                              <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="me">R. E. Lee.</a>
