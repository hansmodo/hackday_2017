<a rel='month origin' value='4'>April</a> <a rel='day origin' value='8'>8th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city origin'>CHARLESTON</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. Yesterday Mrs. Wigfall and I made a few visits. At the first house they wanted Mrs. Wigfall to settle a dispute. " Was she, indeed, fifty-five? " Fancy her face, more than ten years bestowed upon her so freely. 
Then Mrs. Gibbes asked me if I had ever been in Charleston before. Says Charlotte Wigfall (to pay me for my 
snigger when that false fifty was flung in her teeth), " and she thinks this is her native heath and her name is McGregor." She said it all came upon us for breaking the Sabbath, for indeed it was Sunday.

Allen Green came up to speak to me at dinner, in all his soldier's toggery. It sent a shiver through me. Tried to 
read Margaret Fuller Ossoli, but could not. The air is full of war news, and we are all so restless. 
</p><p>
Went to see Miss Pinckney, one of the last of the old-world Pinckneys. She inquired particularly about a portrait of her father, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, which she said had been sent by him to my husband's grand father. I gave a good account of it. It hangs in the place 
of honor in the drawing-room at Mulberry. She wanted to see my husband, for " his grandfather, my father's 
friend, was one of the handsomest men of his day." We came home, and soon Mr. Robert Gourdin and Mr. Miles 
called. Governor Manning walked in, bowed gravely, and seated himself by me. Again he bowed low in mock heroic 
style, and with a grand wave of his hand, said: " Madame, your country is invaded." When I had breath to speak, 
I asked, " What does he mean? " He meant this: there are six men-of-war outside the bar. Talbot and Chew have 
come to say that hostilities are to begin. <a href='/results.php?tla=wfp' rel='acquaintance met'>Governor Pickens</a> 
and <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> are holding a council of war. Mr. Chesnut 
then came in and confirmed the story. Wigfall next entered in boisterous spirits, and said: " There was a sound 
of revelry by night." In any stir or confusion my heart is apt to beat so painfully. Now the agony was so stifling 
I could hardly see or hear. The men went off almost immediately. And I crept silently to my room, where I sat down to a good cry. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Wigfall came in and we had it out on the subject of civil war. We solaced ourselves with dwelling on all its 
known horrors, and then we added what we had a right to expect with Yankees in front and negroes in the rear. 
" The slave-owners must expect a servile insurrection, of course," said Mrs. Wigfall, to make sure that we were unhappy enough. 
</p><p>
Suddenly loud shouting was heard. We ran out. Cannon after cannon roared. We met Mrs. Allen Green in 
the passageway with blanched cheeks and streaming eyes. 
Governor Means rushed out of his room in his dressing-gown and begged us to be calm. " <a href='/results.php?tla=wfp' rel='acquaintance met'>Governor Pickens</a>," 
said he, " has ordered in the plenitude of his wisdom, . 
seven cannon to be fired as a signal to the Seventh Regiment. Anderson will hear as well as the Seventh Regiment. Now you go back and be quiet; fighting in the streets has not begun yet. 
</p><p>
So we retired. Dr. Gibbes calls Mrs. Allen Green Dame Placid. There was no placidity to-day, with cannon bursting and Allen on the Island. No sleep for anybody last night. The streets were alive with soldiers, men shouting, 
marching, singing. Wigfall, the " stormy petrel," is in his glory, the only thoroughly happy person I see. To-day 
things seem to have settled down a little. One can but 
hope still. <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a>, or <a href='/results.php?tla=wls' rel=''>Seward</a>, has made such silly advances and then far sillier drawings back. There may be a chance for peace after all. Things are happening so fast. 
My husband has been made an aide-de-camp to <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>General Beauregard</a>. 
</p><p>
Three hours ago we were quickly packing to go home. The Convention has adjourned. Now he tells me the attack 
on Fort Sumter may begin to-night ; depends upon Anderson and the fleet outside. The Herald says that this show 
of war outside of the bar is intended for Texas. John Manning came in with his sword and red sash, pleased as a boy 
to be on <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard's</a> staff, while the row goes on. He has gone with Wigfall to Captain Hartstein with instructions. Mr. Chesnut is finishing a report he had to make 
to the Convention. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Hayne called. She had, she said, but one feeling; pity for those who are not here. Jack Preston, Willie 
Alston, the take-life-easys, as they are called, with John Green, " the big brave," have gone down to the islands 
volunteered as privates. Seven hundred men were sent over. Ammunition wagons were rumbling along the streets 
all night. Anderson is burning blue lights, signs, and signals for the fleet outside, I suppose. 
</p><p>
To-day at dinner there was no allusion to things as they stand in Charleston Harbor. There was an undercurrent 
of intense excitement. There could not have been a more brilliant circle. In addition to our usual quartette (Judge 
Withers, Langdon Cheves, and Trescott), our two ex-Governors dined with us, Means and Manning. These men all 
talked so delightfully. For once in my life I listened. That over, business began in earnest. Governor Means had 
rummaged a sword and red sash from somewhere and brought it for Colonel Chesnut, who had gone to demand 
the surrender of Fort Sumter. And now patience we must wait. 
</p><p>
Why did that green goose Anderson go into Fort Sumter? Then everything began to go wrong. Now they have 
intercepted a letter from him urging them to let him surrender. He paints the horrors likely to ensue if they will 
not. He ought to have thought of all that before he put his head in the hole.
