<a href='/results.php?city=flat rock' rel='city origin'>FLAT ROCK</a>, N. C., <a rel='month origin' value='8'>August</a> <a rel='day origin' value='1'>1</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>. Being ill I left Mrs. McMahan's for Flat Rock. It was very hot 
and disagreeable for an invalid in a boarding-house in that climate. The La Bordes and the McCord girls came 
part of the way with me.

The cars were crowded and a lame soldier had to stand, leaning on his crutches in the thoroughfare that runs between the seats. One of us gave him our seat. You may depend upon it there was no trouble in finding a seat for 
our party after that. Dr. La Borde quoted a classic anecdote. In some Greek assembly an old man was left standing. A Spartan gave him his seat. The Athenians cheered madly, though they had kept their seats. The comment was, 
Lacedemonians practise virtue; Athenians know how to admire it."

Nathan Davis happened accidentally to be at the station at Greenville. He took immediate charge of Molly and 
myself, for my party had dwindled to us two. He went with us to the hotel, sent for the landlord, told him who I 
was, secured good rooms for us, and saw that we were made comfortable in every way. At dinner I entered that immense dining-room alone, but I saw friends and acquaintances on every side. My first exploit was to repeat to Mrs. Ives Mrs. Pickeus's blunder in taking a suspicious attitude 
toward men born at the North, and calling upon General Cooper to agree with her. Martha Levy explained the 
grave faces of my auditors by saying that Colonel Ives was a New Yorker. My distress was dire.

Louisa Hamilton was there. She told me that Captain George Cuthbert, with his arm in a sling from a wound by 
no means healed, was going to risk the shaking of a stage coach; he was on his way to his cousin, William Cuthbert's, 
at Flat Rock. Now George Cuthbert is a type of the finest kind of Southern soldier. We can not make them any better than he is. Before the war I knew him ; he traveled in Europe with my sister, Kate, and Mary Withers. At once I 
offered him a seat in the comfortable hack Nathan Davis had engaged for me. 
</p><p>
Molly sat opposite to me, and often when I was tired held my feet in her lap. Captain Cuthbert's man sat with 
the driver. We had ample room. We were a dilapidated company. I was so ill I could barely sit up, and Captain Cuthbert could not use his right hand or arm at all. I had to draw his match, light his cigar, etc. He was very quiet, 
grateful, gentle, and, I was going to say, docile. He is a 
fiery soldier, one of those whose whole face becomes transfigured in battle, so one of his men told me, describing his 
way with his company. He does not blow his own trumpet, 
but I made him tell me the story of his duel with the Mercury's reporter. He seemed awfully ashamed of wasting 
time in such a scrape.

That night we stopped at a country house half-way to ward our journey's end. There we met Mr. Charles Lowndes. Rawlins Lowndes, his son, is with Wade Hampton.

First we drove, by mistake, into Judge King's yard, our hackman mistaking the place for the hotel. Then we made 
Farmer's Hotel (as the seafaring men say).

Burnet Rhett, with his steed, was at the door ; horse and man were caparisoned with as much red and gold artillery 
uniform as they could bear. He held his horse. The stirrups were Mexican, I believe; they looked like little side 
saddles. Seeing his friend and crony, George Cuthbert, alight and leave a veiled lady in the carriage, this hand 
some and undismayed young artillerist walked round and round the carriage, talked with the driver, looked in at the 
doors, and at the front. Suddenly I bethought me to raise my veil and satisfy his curiosity. Our eyes met, and I 
smiled. It was impossible to resist the comic disappointment on his face w r hen a woman old enough to be George Cuthbert's mother, with the ravages of a year of gastric fever, almost fainting with fatigue, greeted his vision. He 
instantly mounted his gallant steed and pranced away to his fiancee. He is to marry the greatest heiress in the 
State, Miss Aiken. Then Captain Cuthbert told me his name.

At Kate's, I found Sally Rutledge, and then for weeks life was a blank; I remember nothing. The illness which 
had been creeping on for so long a time took me by the throat. At Greenville I had met many friends. I witnessed the wooing of Barny Heyward, once the husband of the lovely Lucy Izard, now a widower and a bon parti. 
He was there nursing Joe, his brother. So was the beautiful Henrietta Magruder Heyward, now a widow, for poor 
Joe died. There is something magnetic in Tatty Clinch's large and lustrous black eyes. No man has ever resisted 
their influence. She says her virgin heart has never beat one throb the faster for any mortal here below until now, 
when it surrenders to Barny. Well, as I said, Joseph Heyward died, and rapidly did the bereaved beauty shake the 
dust of this poor Confederacy from her feet and plume her wings for flight across the water.
