Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met friend">Burr</a>,
</p><p>
I am just ready to take horse, and therefore cannot have the pleasure
of waiting on you in person. Be pleased to accept of the enclosed
notes on dancing. If you pitch upon it as the subject of your next
discourse, they may, perhaps, furnish you with a few hints, and enable
you to compose with the greater facility and despatch. To do you any
little services in my power will afford me great satisfaction, and I
hope you will take the liberty (it is nothing more, my dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met friend">Burr</a>, than
the freedom of a friend) to call upon me whenever you think I can.
</p><p>
When I shall be here again is uncertain--perhaps not before vacation.
Forbear with me while I say that you cannot speak too slow. Your
good judgment generally leads you to lay the emphasis on the most
forcible word in the sentence; so far you act very right. But the
misfortune is, that you lay too great stress upon the emphatical word.
Every word should be distinctly pronounced; one should not be so
highly sounded as to drown another. To see you shine as a speaker
would give great pleasure to your friends in general, and to me in
particular. I say nothing of your own honour. The desire of making
others happy will, to a generous mind, be the strongest incentive. I
am much mistaken if such a desire has not great influence over you.
You are certainly capable of making a good speaker. Exert yourself. I
am in haste.

Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met friend">Burr</a>, adieu.
