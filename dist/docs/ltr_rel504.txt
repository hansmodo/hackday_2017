I reached here, dearest Mary, this afternoon.  I am very much occupied
in examining matters, and have to go out to look over the ground.
Cousin John tempts me strongly to go down, but I never visit for
many reasons.  If for no other, to prevent compromising the house,
for my visit would certainly be known.

I have written to you fully and to Cousin Anna.  I am decidedly of
the opinion that it would be better for you to leave, on your account
and Cousin Anna's.  My only objection is the leaving of Cousin Anna
alone, if she will not go with you.  If you prefer Richmond, go with
Nannie.  Otherwise, go to the upper country, as John indicates.  I
fear I cannot be with you anywhere.  I do not think Richmond will be
permanent.

                     Truly,                      <a href=http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel rel="me">R.</a>
