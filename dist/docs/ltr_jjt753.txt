I am at present living in a room by myself my room mate having resigned in consequence of his father's ill health. The weather has been extremely cold & stormy here for the last few days though at present it is moderating. My studies for the approaching June examination will include Optics Mechanics Astronomy Magnetism & Chemistry together with drawing. I expect to commence taking exercises in riding in a day or two. At the examination last I rose in each of department of my studies.

A few days since I was called upon to pay the last token of my respect to a friend & fellow classmate in whom were combined both shining talents & the characteristics of a gentleman. His death was much lamented by his class mates who a few days subsequent to his death assembled & appointed a committee to attend to the erection of a monument to his memory. My health is at present as good as usual & I remain your well wishing brother
