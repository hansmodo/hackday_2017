My Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
On Tuesday next I start for Gettysburg to take part 
in the pageant of a dedication of the battle-field as a 
national cemetery. From thence I shall probably go 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, two weeks in advance of the session. 
The very first thing I mean to do is to press the enforcement of the draft. The long detyy and the various 
shifts and subterfuges by which tHe execution of the 
law has thus far been defeated, is disgraceful, and very 
injurious to the cause. ... I notice in some of the 
Southern papers that a hope is entertained that the 
draft cannot be enforced. This is idle. The war was 
never more popular than at this moment. The new 
call will fall lightly. Ohio must send thirty-five 
thousand, or one to fifteen of her voters. The apportionment has been made even to townships and 
wards, and in very many places the quota will be made 
by voluntary enlistments, aided by large gratuitous 
bounties from citizens. There is no lack of men or of 
a determination to send them. The wonderful prosperity 
of all classes, especially of laborers, has a tendency 
to secure acquiescence in all measures demanded to 
carry on the war. We are only another example of a 
people growing rich in a great war. And this is not 
shown simply by inflated prices, but by increased production, new manufacturing establishments, new railroads, houses, etc. . . . Indeed, every branch of 
business is active and hopeful. This is not a mere 
temporary inflation caused by paper money, but is a 
steady progress, and almost entirely upon actual capital. 
The people are prospering and show their readiness to 
push on the war. Taxes are paid cheerfully, and the 
voluntary donations for our soldiers and their families 
are counted by thousands. ... I confide in your success.

Affectionately,
