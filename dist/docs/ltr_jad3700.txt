Dear General, 
</p><p>
Yesterday I had the honor of your Excellency's 
very friendly letter of the 4th instant, for which be 
pleased to accept my warmest thanks. 
</p><p>
Before this reaches jour hands, you will have received the new arrangement of the army. Submitted, 
as it is, to your opinion, it is only to be considered 
as an essay, open to such alterations as you may 
suggest. The idea of a majority of Congress was 
clear, that it would be too hazardous to risk the defence of America on the practicability of drawing an 
army for the war into the field by the first of January. The alternative, therefore, as you will find it 
guarded, was thought necessary, though all admitted 
a permanent force to be most desirable. I saw and 
explained the danger of an alternative, however cautiously expressed. The States may think they do 
enough if they comply with either of the injunctions; 
and while men who make arms a profession have a 
prospect of being annually retained for high premiums, they will hardly tie themselves at once for 
the war. 
</p><p>
In the original proposition there was another alternative, â€” for the war, or for three f/ears ; besides that 
which gives your Excellency so much and such just 
apprehension. This last was rejected by a majority, 
perhaps unfortunately, as, in The opinion of many, it 
strengthened the reasons for the annual supply by 
drafts. I do not think it too late to correct this error, if pointed out with the force that every thing 
falls from your pen. The manner of reduction is, 
I am confident, liable to great objection, and I have 
no doubt but you will suggest a rule, or principle, 
or any thing you may think better, which will avoid 
the difficulty you suggest, and meet with approbation ; for I do not conceive that a single member 
will be tenacious of the provision on this article. Indeed, I am persuaded that your Excellency's representations, on this and every subject, will have as much influence as you can wish; and that, on this 
particular occasion, nothing hut a clear conviction of 
impracticability will induce Congress to overrule your opinion. 
</p><p>
A false estimate of the power and perseverance of 
our enemies was friendly to the present revolution, 
and inspired that confidence of success, in all ranks 
of people, which was necessary to unite them in so 
arduous a cause. You cannot forget the opinions 
which were current on this floor, at the first and 
second Congresses, and how firmly they established 
this error. We seem to part with it with reluctance; 
it still hangs heavy upon us, and has produced the 
indecision, the expedients, and the debility of which 
you complain. I hope misfortunes and distresses will, 
at length, rouse us to just sentiments and vigorous 
exertions, and, with your Excellency, I pray God, 
that the fatal delusion which has marked our conduct, may end here. 
</p><p>
When the enemy turn their eyes to the southward, 
they see too much imbecility not to be encouraged 
to attempt to extend their conquest, and improve 
advantages which they have derived, in no small 
degree, from our own temerity and misconduct. I 
believe we shall not want men to oppose them, Virginia having made efforts, the expensiveness of which 
is incredible, and North Carolina being equally disposed to act vigorously, though not so capable to 
raise their quota, for a fixed and certain period. I 
wish we may have it in our power to provide the 
necessary supplies. Your Excellency too well knows 
and feels our difficulties and embarrassments, and that 
they are only to be surmounted by great exertions. 
I flatter myself that you do me no more than justice 
in believing that duty and inclination equally demand 
my assiduous endeavours to correct our past errors, 
and draw forth our resources. 
</p><p>
I am much obliged to your Excellency for your 
account of the interview at <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>; and beg you 
to believe, that no man can be with greater affection 
and personal attachment than I am, &c., 
</p><p>
