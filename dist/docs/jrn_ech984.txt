A very turbulent sea has prevented our piling on the canvas. In the course of ten minutes we have had rain, hail, snow and sunshine. This afternoon a penguin kept floating round the ship a long time. This was the first penguin I ever saw and as it came up to the surface of the water appeared very much like a guinea in form and of a dark greenish color. They are covered with feathers and have short wings but cannot fly. The greatest peculiarity about them is the tail which is perpendicular with the body, like a fish, and answers the purpose of a rudder. While we were watching it, a wave broke over and gave me, with several others, a good drenching. Mr. Sterling caught a bird, as large as our common goose, and had it broiled. It was pronounced very good.

The younger Stocton and Tilghman being drunk this afternoon, the latter was for making disturbances with several of the passengers and at length succeeded in insulting the doctor. The lie was given on both sides and succeeded by blows, but the assailants were parted and neither was much hurt. Tilghman was threatened with handcuffs by the Captain. This appeared to have a good influence, for soon after he was quieted.

Last evening a noisy, drunken crowd commenced and kept on until the noon of night, soon after which a tragedy or farce was enacted which will require some explanation to make it intelligible to those who did not witness it. Mr. H. and lady occupy a stateroom in the after-part of our cabin. Mr. H., being one of the revellers, was pretty well "how come you so," and lay behind the stove in the upper cabin a little while. He then came down and got into Atkins' berth where he lay a few minutes, and then into Mr. J.'s, and being routed out of the latter place, he lay on the floor near
his door, when the light was suddenly extinguished. His wife shrieked, declaring that some one was attacking her. As soon as she screamed, Mr. H. made his way to his room, crying out "Murder, Murder, Murder!" "Captain Palmer!" "Fire!" and exhibited a dagger with a blade about five inches long covered to the hilt with blood, with which it was said Mrs. H. stabbed the intruder. While this was occurring, a light was brought but no wound could be found upon him.

This tragical affair was further examined into today, but resulted in nothing but the exculpation of the individual charged, and established beyond doubt that it was nothing but a farce, designed to remove the bad impressions created by the lady's former unbecoming conduct. The blood on the dagger is accounted for from the fact that two gonies were caught and slain by Mr. H. in the afternoon. For fear that something more serious may grow out of this affair, a regular watch has been formed at the request of the Captain, by the lower cabin passengers, to serve each two hours.

Within the last three or four days several hats and caps have been lost overboard. In fact, our course could almost be marked out by the caps that have been lost.
