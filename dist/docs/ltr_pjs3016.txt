DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
About an hour ago <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>General Arnold</a></a>, who is arrived 
here from Canada, sent me a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague met'>General Sullivan</a>, inclosing one from <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>General Arnold</a></a> to him, 
another from Colonel Ilazen, and a third from Lieutenant-Colonel Antill, copies of all which I do myself 
the honor to inclose. The grief I feel on the evacuation of Canada by our troops, is greatly alleviated by the little loss sustained in the retreat, and the 
hope I have, that we shall maintain a superiority on 
the Lakes. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will observe that <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a></a> 
intimates that further than the Isle-aux-Noix he could 
not retreat, without your Excellency's or my orders, 
previous to which he observes, that the Council of 
War were unanimous for coming to Crown Point. I 
do not hesitate to say, that I wish he had retreated. 
at least as far south as Point-au-Fer, or Isle-la-Motte, as I am afraid that the enemy will throw 
themselves between him and the broad part of Lake 
Champlain, and render it extremely difficult, if not 
impossible, to send on a supply of provisions, as 
they can with light cannon and even wall-pieces command the waters from shore to shore in most places, 
for six miles south of Isle-aux-Noix, and in many even 
with musketry. 
</p><p>
Did not the danger of remaining there, especially 
with an army broken and spiritless, and who wish so 
much to come further south, that the officers, as <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>General Arnold</a></a> informs me, have already, in a body, 
entreated him to come away, appear to me too great 
to admit of the delay of waiting your Excellency's 
orders, I should not send mine for a further retreat, 
until your pleasure could be known ; but I trust I 
shall be justified in doing it, and yet I believe the 
order will meet the army on this side of Isle-aux-Noix. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to order up six anchors and cables for the gondolas that are constructing, of the size of what is called the small anchor and cable of an <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> sloop. 
</p><p>
I shall immediately write to Governor Trunibull to provide fifty ship-carpenters, if he can, and send for a like number to the Massachusetts Bay. 
</p><p>
If any Dutch mill-saws can be procured at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, be pleased to order up four dozen, with six dozen of files for them. 
</p><p>
Having learned that <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> is upon his way up, I have ordered a boat down to meet him. I am, dear General, with every sentiment of esteem and respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
