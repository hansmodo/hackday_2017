My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Calling to mind the friendly spirit which animates your 
letters to me, I am not ashamed of being deemed impertinently selfish, when I commence my reply to your last very 
obliging communication of November, <a href='/results.php?year=1809'>1809</a>, by telling you 
that about a year and three-quarters ago, I changed my 
residence, and find myself in the habitation which my family 
now occupies, and which we find more salubrious than 
Clapham Common. We are just one mile from the turnpike gate at Hyde Park corner, which I think you will not 
have forgotten yet, having about three acres of pleasure ground around my house, or rather behind it, and several 
old trees, walnut and mulberry, of thick foliage. I can sit 
and read under their shade, which I delight in doing, with 
as much admiration of the beauties of nature (remembering the same time the words of my favourite poet : nature is 
but an effect, whose cause is God), as if I were two hundred miles from the great city. 
</p><p>
My parliamentary duties force me to be within easy 
reach of London all the winter, and even spring, and sometimes for a part of the summer. I have a very affectionate 
wife, who is always unwilling to be at a distance from me ; 
and <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> has blest us with six children, the eldest 
of whom is hot quite twelve, the youngest under two years 
of age. My family are breathing pure air, and taking exercise quietly and without restraint, while I am in the harness 
at St. Stephens, or, to continue the metaphor, in a very 
good stable just opposite Westminster Hall, where I commonly, or rather chiefly take both my food and rest during 
the whole session, often being unable to come over to Kensington-gore from Monday morning to Saturday night; 
always, however, within call, should domestic matters 
require my presence. 
</p><p>
I was not aware that my egotism would be so tedious, 
yet again let me confess that I am not afraid of subjecting 
myself, with you, to any severity of censure. When I have 
a regard for any one, I like to know his habits of life, times, 
places, &c, and I recollect with pleasure, that you kindly 
gave me an account of your family matters, and of your 
present situation and pursuits. Let me beg you to be so 
obliging as to continue so to do, in any letter which you may 
do me the favour to write ; next, let me not forget to inform 
you, that your friendly packet of the 8th November last, of 
which I received duplicates first, brought me two copies of 
your favour of 14th April, <a href='/results.php?year=1800'>1800</a>, for which, however late, 
accept my best thanks. In conformity with the kind wish 
you express, that I should name to you some person in 
London to whom your letters may be addressed, let me 
name Robert Barclay, Esq. (the great brewer), or Samuel Hoare, Esq., the banker, both of whom I think you knew. 
</p><p>
I wish I could recollect with certainty, how many of the 
reports of the African Institution I sent you. I will, however, transmit to you either to New- York or <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
accordingly as on inquiry I shall judge best, all the reports 
but the first. Indeed on consideration, I will send them all, 
as you may promote our common object, by giving away 
any copies you do not wish to retain. 
I am grieved to tell you, that both your countrymen and 
my own are still carrying on the abominable traffic in human flesh, in spite of the abolition laws of their respective 
countries. I trust that a continuance of the vigorous 
methods we are using to carry our law into effect, will by 
degrees force our commercial men to employ their substance 
in some more innocent commerce. It has given me no 
little pleasure, to find all your several ministers (both <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='colleague met'>Mr. King</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=jam' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Monroe</a>, and <a href='/results.php?tla=top' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Pinckney</a> warmly disposed 
to co-operate, so far as they properly could in their peculiar 
situation ; and I am not without hopes of a practical, though 
not a formal adoption of the only effectual expedient for 
suppressing the slave trade, that of the armed vessels of 
both our countries taking the slave ships of the other as well 
as those of its own. There might be objections, though I 
own I can see none of sufficient importance to outweigh 
the countervailing benefits to a regular compact between 
our two countries for the above purpose ; but it will answer 
the same end, provided we respectively abstain from claiming any of our vessels which may have been captured when 
engaged in the slave trade. I have received, within a few 
weeks, the opinion of your attorney-general in its practical 
tendency in favour of the system I am wishing to see established. 
</p><p>
My dear sir, I know not how I have been able, .with the 
pen in my hand, to abstain so long from expressing the sincere and great pleasure it has given me to find affairs taking 
a more favourable turn between our two countries. I can 
only account for my not breaking out on this topic, on my 
first sitting down to write to you, by the consideration that 
when once there is a favourable issue in any case, in which 
we have been receiving or communicating from time to 
time the tidings of the day, with extreme anxiety and earnestness (the French word empressement better expresses 
what I mean), as for instance in the case of the illness of a 
friend, we become so cool that we perhaps forget to inquire 
about, or to name at all, the very topic on which, during the 
state of suspense, \vc were continually asking for or giving 
intelligence with such feverish solicitude. Really, the idea 
of a war between our two countries is perfectly horrible; 
and I am really happy to say, that I think in this country this most just sentiment gains ground. Like all propositions which are founded in truth and reason, it gradually 
sinks into the minds of men, and though perhaps slowly and inscnsiUy. by degrees it leavens nearly the whole mass. It 
will tend to produce this friendly disposition on your side of 
the water, if mere of your countrymen would come over and 
live awhile among us. We are an idle people ; we are a 
busy people, and may not have leisure or disposition to pay 
all the personal attentions which politeness might prescribe; 
but I am persuaded that any gentleman of character and 
moderation who should visit this country, would meet with 
such a friendly reception as would show him that the circumstance of our being the descendants of common progenitors is not forgotten, or rather, that it is reviving and 
diffusing itself with increasing force. 
</p><p>
Before I conclude, let me express the satisfaction it gave 
me to find that you were safely laid up, if I may so express 
it, in a comfortable and tranquil harbour, after having figuratively as well as literally been so long, or at least so often, 
tossed on the stormy sea of public life. May I confess to 
you, at very near 51 only in years, but with only a weakly 
constitution and after having been in parliament very near 
thirty years, that I begin to look forward to the same secession from public life ; meaning, however, to form no positive 
determination for the future, but to follow the leadings of Providence, and do on the day the duties of the day. 
</p><p>
In three or four years, my four boys, the eldest especially, will be attaining that period of life when a father's 
eye and tongue may be most useful and necessary to their 
future well-doing; and really the business of parliament 
has increased so much of late years, as to render it next 
to impossible for any man who cannot live for six or seven 
months in every year with a very small proportion of food 
or sleep, especially the latter, to attend at all, as he would 
otherwise be glad to do, to domestic or social claims. 
Then let me add, â€” and if you will take it as intended in 
the way of a hint to yourself, excuse only my freedom 
in giving it, and you will not greatly mistake my meaning : 
any man who has acted his part at all creditably on the 
stage of public life, may render very great service to mankind, especially to his own countrymen, with whose opinions, prejudices, and errors he is well acquainted, by his 
pen ; for instance, by bearing testimony to the truth of the 
position winch, however trite, it is still useful now and then 
to repeat and enforce, that honesty is the best policy, &c. 
</p><p>
I happen to have just now many claims of an epistolary 
nature, which have been too long neglected, owing to my 
having left them, as in your case, to be attended to w r hen 
the recess of parliament should afford me a little more 
leisure. Much writing also affects my breathing. I must 
therefore conclude. But before I lay down my pen, let me, 
recollecting your kindly opening your mind to me on one 
important occasion, in, I think, <a href='/results.php?year=1795'>1795</a> (or <a href='/results.php?year=1796'>1796</a>), beg that 
when you next write to me, you would favour me by telling 
me how you would vote, &c, if you were in our House of 
Commons, on the question of parliamentary reform. I do 
not ask you to take the trouble of entering into a detailed 
statement of the premises which may lead you to form your 
judgment on that point, whatever it may be ; I wish only 
(unless you have a little leisure) for your conclusion. I 
will own to you, that one main motive with me for having 
supported, on a late occasion, the motion for parliamentary 
reform, was the persuasion that by taking away what must 
be confessed to be a blemish or blot, in an assembly which 
is professedly formed on the principle of representation, we 
are lessening the power of bad men to misrepresent and 
defame our constitution, and to mislead the well-intentioned 
but perhaps less acute and long-sighted, into a concurrence 
in their measures. 2dly, it' the measure should be adopted at 
all, it is desirable that it should be so at a time when, as is 
really the case now, notwithstanding the confident assurances of such men as Cobbett and his adherents, the country 
feels coolly on the subject, and is therefore not likely to 
push its representatives to go dangerous lengths; for I think 
you will agree with me, that it is a species of reform, all 
things considered, concerning which, in this country and at 
this time, it is better of the two not to go quite far enough, 
than to go too far. 
</p><p>
Farewell, my dear sir, and believe me, with cordial esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
Your faithful servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=wwi" rel="me">W. WILBERFORCE</a>. 
</p><p>
P.S. As I shall be sending you a parcel, and I do not 
recollect that 1 ever begged your acceptance of a religious 
publication, which I first sent into the world the year I married (and what I say of wedded life, I thank heaven I should 
not now alter), let me now transmit it as a testimony of my 
esteem and regard. It was, in truth, principally intended 
for the use of my friends, and therefore I may send it to you 
with great propriety. I will also accompany it with another on the slave trade. May these books preserve in 
your family the memorial of our friendly, connexion, and if 
you will not call me impertinent, I will request from you 
some similar memorial.
