MY DEAR FRIEND, The inclosed bill relating to the Judiciary has been just introduced into the Senate. Having not yet 
looked it over, I can say nothing of its merits. You will be a 
better judge, and such remarks as your leisure will permit will 
be acceptable and useful. 
</p><p>
A very interesting Question is started By whom officers 
appointed during pleasure by the President and Senate are to 
be displaced? Whether the power results to the authority appointing, or, as an Executive function, to the President, who is 
vested with the Executive power, except so far as it is expressly 
qualified? My present opinion is, that tJie Senate is associated 
with the President by way of exception, and cannot, tJierefore, 
claim beyond the exception. This construction has its inconveniences, particularly in referring too much to a single discretion; 
but it is checked by the elective character of the Executive, his 
being impeachable at all times, and the subordinate officers 
being also impeachable. His power under this construction will 
be merely in a capacity to remove worthy officers; but experience shews that this is not the prevailing evil, the continuance 
of the unworthy being the most so. Add to this that his caprice would be restrained by the necessity of the Senate's concurrence in supplying the vacancy; and that injured merit would 
be supported by the public opinion, would attack with probability of success the re-election of the President, and would at 
least be able to make a party against him in the Legislature, 
and go into one or other of its branches to plague his administration. High as the existing President stands, I question 
whether it would be very safe for him even not to reinstate Jay 
or Knox, &c. On the contrary construction the Senate must 
sit constantly; officers would make parties there to support them 
against the President, and, by degrees, the Executive power 
would slide into one branch of the Legislature; on the most 
favorable supposition it would be a two-headed monster. 
</p><p>
Excuse the scrawl, which a moment only has permitted, the 
hour of the mail being come. 
</p><p>
Most truly.
