There has long, my dear sir, been something about my 
heart which urged me to write to you ; but I thought it 
selfish to diminish your few leisure moments by an additional correspondent, especially as your punctuality and 
attention would probably have led you to consult my wishes 
rather than your own convenience. The time, I hope, will 
come, when the return of tranquillity will give me an opp< >rtunity of conversing with you on several interesting subjects. 
I have, however, concluded to allow myself the pleasure of 
writing you a few lines now and then. Indeed, I ought to 
have recollected, that while I was giving myself credit in 
my own mind for self-denial, you might have been charging 
me in yours for inattention ; and, therefore, that it might 
have been more prudent, and perhaps not less generous, to 
have troubled you with letters, than with inducements to 
suspect that my heart, like a feather, would, with equal ease, 
stick to, or quit any man on whom the breath of whim or 
interest might blow it on or off.

The firmness and delicacy observed in the case of Major 
Andre, is exceedingly admired here. I am happy Colonel 
Beverley did not succeed in renewing his acquaintance with 
you. You have really been very fortunate in having so 
long resisted the attacks of open enemies, and escaped the 
snares of secret ones. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty of sending you a cask of Packaretti, the 
favourite wine of our late friend, Don Juan, whose death I 
much lament. His place will, I believe, be soon filled by a 
gentleman who will probably deliver you a letter of introduction from me.

Mr. Harrison, a very worthy kinsman of your secretary, is 
shipping from Cadiz the clothing taken by Admiral Cordova, 
and presented by France and Spain to Congress. I have 
desired him to send you invoices of each parcel. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Jay has more than usual health, and seems as much 
interested in your health and safety, as if you was her own 
father, as well as that of her country. Be pleased to present 
our best wishes to Mrs. Washington ; and when you write 
to your honest friend, Colonel Harrison, remember me to 
him. I hope Arnold has not spoiled his mill-dam. God bless you, my dear sir. 
</p><p>
I am, with perfect esteem and regard, 
Your friend and servant,
