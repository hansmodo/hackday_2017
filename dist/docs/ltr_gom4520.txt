Dear General, 
</p><p>
After many unforeseen delays, I am about shortly to take 
my departure from Philadelphia for the kingdom of France, 
and I expect to visit both Holland and England. When I 
desire to be favored with your commands, it is not the mere 
ceremonious form of words, which you may every day meet 
from every man you meet, and which you know better than 
any man how to estimate at its true value. Whether I can be 
useful to you in any way, I know not ; but this I know, that 
you may command my best endeavors. And I now desist 
from farther profession on that subject, because I am sure you 
know my sincerity. 
</p><p>
You will oblige me by giving me letters of introduction to those persons, who may in your opinion be useful to me, and 
to whom you may think it proper to present me. Among others to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr Jefferson</a>, with whom I have only a slight acquaintance. I believe I once mentioned to you my wish, not to be 
encumbered with the letters introductory of the many, who are prone to give them. I think them a kind of paper money ; 
which is not only of little value, but which is not always a reputable, though a legal tender. I solicit yours, as an undoubted 
bill of exchange, which is gold wherever it goes. Permit me, however, to pursue the mercantile phrase, or metaphor, and 
honestly to request that you do not give me credit for more than I am worth, lest proving a bankrupt, you be called on by my creditors. 
</p><p>
I will pray your care of the enclosed to <a href='/results.php?tla=dah' rel='met'>Colonel Humphreys</a>, who, I doubt not, is still with you, and will, I expect, 
come on with you in the spring. I promised you some Chinese pigs, a promise which I can perform only by halves ; 
but such as I have I will send you; and, to piece and patch the matter as well as I may, in company with the pigs shall 
be sent a pair of Chinese geese, which are really the foolishest geese ever beheld, for they choose all times for sitting but the spring, and one of them is now actually engaged in that business. 
</p><p>
It would be degrading to the noble race of man, should I 
introduce politics after hogs and geese. This is a tolerable 
excuse for saying nothing, but the truth is I have nothing to 
say. I am of the breed of optimists, and believe that all will 
go well, for you will certainly be seated in the President's 
chair, and will, I am certain, when there greatly labor to prevent things from going ill. As to the rest, I heartily agree in 
the text, that " the wisdom of man is foolishness with God," 
having seen both fools and folly succeed in a most surprising 
manner. And the only key to such sort of success, that I 
ever met with, was in a sarcastic remark on three lawyers of 
New York; Smith given to the study of divinity, Alexander 
deep in mathematics, and C. deep in nothing. Smith, said the 
wag, is always in the clouds ; Alexander loses himself in 
angles and triangles ; the only sensible man at the bar is C. 
for he talks nonsense to a common jury. 
</p><p>
Present, I pray you, my sincere respects to Mrs Washington. It is my fervent wish, that neither she nor you may regret 
the shades of Mount Vernon. But this is more my wish, than expectation, for I do not believe it possible for you to be more 
happily placed, at least if I may judge from what I saw and what I felt. I am yours, 
</p><p>
