One just from <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> tells us that my presentiment about our house is verified; Yankees do 
inhabit it, a Yankee colonel and his wife. They say they look strangely at home on our front gallery, 
pacing up and down. . . . And a stranger and a Yankee occupies our father's place at the table where 
he presided for thirty-one years. . . . And the old lamp that lighted up so many eager, laughing faces 
around the dear old table night after night; that with its great beaming eye watched us one by one 
as we grew up and left our home; that witnessed every parting and every meeting ; by which we sang, read, talked, danced, and made merry; the lamp 
that Hal asked for as soon as he beheld the glittering chandeliers of the new innovation, gas; the lamp 
that all agreed should go to me among other treasures, and be cased in glass to commemorate the 
old days, our old lamp has passed into the hands of strangers who neither know nor care for its history. And mother's bed (which, with the table and 
father's little ebony stand, alone remained uninjured) belongs now to a Yankee woman! Father prized his ebony table. He said he meant to have a 
gold plate placed in its centre, with an inscription, and I meant to have it done myself when he died so soon after. A Yankee now sips his tea over it, just 
where some beau or beauty of the days of Charles II may have rested a laced sleeve or dimpled arm. . . .
Give the devil his due. Bless Yankees for one thing; they say they tried hard to save our State House.
