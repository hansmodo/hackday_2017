Sir, 
</p><p>
So many letters both for and from me miscarry, that I take this opportunity of informing you, that I have had the 
pleasure of writing to you by the way of Cadiz, and that I consider myself much obliged by your favour of the 27th 
Feb. last, which did not come to my hands till long after it. must have arrived here. The intelligence communicated 
by it was no less welcome than interesting. We wait with impatience for further information respecting the military 
operations in the southern States. Lord Cornwallis's expedition bears some marks of rashness, and I cannot but 
expect he will have some reason to repent it. I think his temper and measures well calculated to enrage and discipline the southern militia ; if so, his victories will render 
his enemies more numerous and formidable than ever. The ratification of the confederation, and the firm establishment 
of civil government in the different states, are circumstances very friendly to the American cause, and should be viewed 
by our enemies as insurmountable obstacles to our again 
becoming their subjects. Such, however, is their infatuation and their obstinacy, that there appears very little reason to flatter ourselves with a speedy peace, unless this 
campaign should produce events greatly to their prejudice. I hope, therefore, that our countrymen will not suffer themselves to be amused with such delusive expectations, but on 
the contrary will persevere vigorously and systematically 
in preparing to prosecute the war.

I am, sir, your most obedient and humble servant,
