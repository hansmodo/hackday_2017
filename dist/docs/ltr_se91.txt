I know I wasn't supposed to be sick, so tried to pretend I wasn't and 
just went to work Thursday and Friday and tried to stick with the normal 
routine, but the body isn't fooled, I lost my voice on Saturday (not 
screaming for Cal in double overtime victory--but would have if I could) 
so here I am lying in bed for awhile. Luckily MH is supportive (or at 
least doesn't want me sneezing in people's faces, a near occurrence) and 
I don't have much to do until Wednesday-Friday. Half the office is 
sicker than me, by the way. MH also says I'll be helping him staff 
meetings in DC March 1-6, so if I can get over my fear of flying, I get 
to see Rochelle twice in a month, which will be nice.<p>I wanted to follow up on our conversations of last week about <a href="results.php?tla=dse">Dad</a>. Have 
you done any more thinking about what approach you would like to take? I 
think what I heard you say was that you want to stay very involved in 
taking care of him, and aren\'t sure if a new person would be able to 
understand all the nuances, and of course, the issues of longer term 
care bring up financial considerations. I also think I heard you say 
that dealing with the Veterans Administration and Medicare is a murky 
and bureaucratic undertaking, and maybe I can help with that and 
finances in general, being my little area of expertise.

In fact, I had this vision about organizing a summit conference to help 
you deal with all this, each in his or her own way, but perhaps that is 
a little over the top. This  family email will have to suffice. My fear 
of needles alone gets in the way of being as much help as I would like 
to be, but as someone with a talent for organization and Public 
Administration and Writing, surely,  I can put some of this to use. 
Maybe we can make the circular email a weekly feature, to keep things 
moving, to deal with the overwhelmingness of it all? Anyway, I thought 
maybe a family discussion might help, get people's ideas, maybe widen 
the circle eventually to people like my friend Penny who could probably 
help translate the Veterans eligibility stuff, My co-worker Charlotte, 
who used to work for a home health care provider has also offerred to 
help, or even Rochelle, who can call the Secretary in DC if we really 
need to bring out the big guns. He\'s a veteran, we know this, Penny says 
he should be eligible for their home care program, they should get on it 
rather than running you around looking for stuff to turn in. What more 
is left?

The Alzheimer's book mentioned a number of things: Day Care you tried 
and looks like it won't work in this stage of incontinence and 
combativeness; long term care for when it just gets to be too much, you 
are researching, and Home Care/Respite Care. My original thought there 
was to get some non-nursing professional refered by Stanford Hospital or 
some reputable source, perhaps your case worker, and try it once a week, 
to see how it works out. If you were satisfied, you could add days, 
hours, whatever you thought best. This would also allow you some time to 
yourself, which I think is important to your health, and <a href="results.php?tla=mke">Mike</a> to go back 
to work, etc. This would all have to be paid for of course, though, but 
is solveable, maybe even on the Medicare/Health Insurance side, it seems 
to me that in addition to the Veterans angle, I've heard that if there 
is a medical reason to have home care provided, they have to do it. The 
continuing diabetes and blackouts seem to qualify, and Brian said the 
other day that the income eligibility requirements can be moderated, but 
that may be problematic. If you feel you've done all the research and 
know the answer, then I apologise. But if you'd like me to do a second 
read of the materials and make a few phone calls, I can do that. I will 
need to have my glasses handy, though, I had trouble reading the small 
print last time.

So these are just a few thoughts I had while lying around here doing 
nothing. I may go read on my little deck later, but it's not as sunny as 
yesterday. Love, <a href="results.php?tla=dse2">Steve</a>.
