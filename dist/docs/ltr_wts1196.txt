HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,

Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant</a> and I at Chicago had one or two stolen interviews in which he said he would leave me, as I wished, 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a> till the last minute, viz., March 4, and he 
assured me that he would oppose, if it came to him, 
any change as to the law in the matter of the office of 
General, or the diminution of salary. The only trouble 
is in my successor. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a> is out of the question. 
Meade comes next on the list, but is not a favorite. 
Sheridan comes next in order and is Grant's preference, 
I think. Thomas could not be passed over if by the 
accidents of war Sheridan had not already got over him. 
</p><p>
Thomas is universally esteemed, but was not made 
a regular Major General till his battle of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>. 
Whereas Sheridan, at least 13 years younger in service, 
was made a Major General for his Winchester battle the 
summer previous. So I think Sheridan will be chosen 
by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant</a> as Lt. Genl. Say not a word of this, as Grant 
will not wish to act till the last minute of time. 
</p><p>
We had the most enthusiastic meeting at Chicago possible, and on the whole it was the best meeting we ever 
had or ever will have again. All persons, Grant included, 
volunteered the most fulsome eulogies of my short address of welcome, which is badly reported in the telegraphic despatches, but it was carefully written out and 
will be correctly printed when the whole proceedings are 
booked. 
</p><p>
Yours, 
</p><p>
