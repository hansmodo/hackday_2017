My dear General, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will find, by the papers of yesterday, which I do myself the pleasure to inclose, that 
the Governor has taken his seat as President of the 
Convention; and that he came forward with a motion 
for the adoption of the Constitution, and subjoined a 
recommendation that some alterations may take place 
in it. The motion has taken up a considerable time. 
Those in the opposition Vv^ant the Constitution to be 
accepted upon condition that the alterations be made. 
This they will not be able to carry. 
</p><p>
Yesterday noon, a motion was made that the motion under consideration should be committed. This 
was agreed to, and a large Committee was raised, 
consisting of two members from each of the large 
counties, and of one for two small ones. It was also 
agreed that each county should nominate their own 
members, and that they should take one who had 
given his opinion for, and one who had given his 
opinion against, the Constitution, in each county wherein two were chosen. I expect they will report tomorrow afternoon, to which time the Convention stands 
adjourned. I hope good will arise from the measure, 
and that the main question will be taken by Wednesday next. The gentlemen in the opposition urge that 
the Governor's motion ought to be divided, and that 
the first question be taken simply, " Whether they will 
or will not accept the Constitution." They are opposed in this, and I hope the large Committee will 
adjust the matter, and put an end to any further 
dispute upon the question. 
</p><p>
We find ourselves exceedingly embarrassed by the 
temper which raged the last winter in some of the 
counties. Many of the insurgents are in the Convention; even some of Shays's officers. A great proportion of those men are high in the opposition. We 
could hardly expect any thing else ; nor could we, I 
think, justly suppose that those men, who were so 
lately intoxicated with large draughts of liberty, and 
who were thirsting for more, would, in so short a 
time, submit to a Constitution which would further 
take up the reins of Government which, in their 
opinion, were too strait before. I hope people abroad 
will consider this matter, and make proper allowances for a clog of this kind. I think the Constitution will pass. I have the honor of being, my 
dear General, 
</p><p>
With perfect esteem, &c.,
