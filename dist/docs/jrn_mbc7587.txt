Last night there was a crowd of men to see us and they were so markedly critical. I made a futile 
effort to record their sayings, but sleep and heat overcame me. To-day I can not remember a word. One of Mr. Mason's stories relates to our sources of trustworthy information. A man of very respectable appearance standing on 
the platform at the depot, announced, "I am just from the seat of war." Out came pencil and paper from the news 
paper men on the qui vive. il Is Fairfax Court House burned? " they asked. " Yes, burned yesterday." " But I am just from there," said another; " left it standing 
there all right an hour or so ago. " " Oh ! But I must do them justice to say they burned only the tavern, for they 
did not want to tear up and burn anything else after the railroad." " There is no railroad at Fairfax Court 
House," objected the man just from Fairfax. "Oh! In deed! " said the seat-of-war man, " I did not know that;

Our people are lashing themselves into a fury against the prisoners. Only the mob in any country would do that. 
But I am told to be quiet. Decency and propriety will not be forgotten, and the prisoners will be treated as prisoners 
of war ought to be in a civilized country.
