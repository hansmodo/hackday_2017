STEAMBOAT POTOMAC, 
</p><p>
1st June, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1830">1830</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR: I have just received your letter of the 31st ultimo, which was handed me by Mr. Archer. It gives me the first intimation that I have had, that 
the President applied to you to obtain information of what took place in the 
cabinet of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Monroe</a> on the subject of the Seminole campaign; and, of 
course, as I suppose, that you were acting for him, and not for yourself, in 
your correspondence with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>. Neither the copy of his letter to 
you, placed in my hands by the President, nor his note covering the copy, 
gave me the slightest intimation of this fact; but, on the contrary, I had a 
right to presume, from Mr. Crawford giving you authority to show me his 
letter if you pleased, that the correspondence originated with yourself, and 
Was under your entire control, and not, as I now infer, "at the request of 
the President, and for his use." The view in which I regarded the correspondence, and which I was justified to do, judging by the facts before me, fully 
explains my remarks in my letter to the President, as far as you were concerned with them. 
</p><p>
In the direction which this affair has taken, it is not for me to determine 
whether you ought to furnish me any information, or what it ought to be. 
Had I supposed, that, under the circumstances in which I was placed, such a 
right belonged to me, I would have claimed it previous! to my answer to 
the President's letter, so as to have had the advantage, before I made my reply, of whatever light might be furnished from the sources I therein indicated. That there are those who intend ftat this affair shall operate against me 
politically, by causing a rupture between myself and the President, and 
thereby affect, if possible, my standing with the nation, I cannot doubt, for 
reasons which I have stated in my answer to the President; but I must be 
permitted to express my surprise that you should suppose that my remarks 
comprehended you, when they expressly referred to those whose names 
did not appear in the transaction, and consequently excluded you. 
</p><p>
My answer to the President is his property, and not mine; and consequently it belongs to him, and not to me, to determine to whom he shall, or 
shall not, give copies. 
</p><p>
I am, very respectfully, &c. 
</p><p>
