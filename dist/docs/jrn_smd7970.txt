Our distress about Gibbes has been somewhat relieved by good news from Jimmy. The jolliest 
sailor letter from him came this morning, dated only the 4th instant from Cherbourg, detailing his 
cruise on the Georgia from leaving England, to Bahia, Trinidad, Cape of Good Hope, to France 
again. Such a bright, dashing letter! We laughed extravagantly over it when he told how they readily 
evaded the Vanderbilt, knowing she would knock them into "pie"; how he and the French Captain 
quarreled when he ordered him to show his papers, and how he did not know French abuse enough to 
enter into competition with him, so went back a first and second time to Maury when the man would 
not let him come aboard, whereupon Maury brought the ship to with two or three shots and Jimmy made 
a third attempt, and forced the Frenchman to show 
his papers. He tells it in such a matter-of-fact way! 
No extravagance, no idea of having been in a dangerous situation, he a boy of eighteen, on a French ship 
in spite of the Captain's rage. What a jolly life it 
must be! Now dashing in storms and danger, now 
floating in sunshine and fun ! Wish I was a midship 
man ! Then how he changes, in describing the prize 
with an assorted cargo that they took, which contained all things from a needle to pianos, from the 
reckless spurt in which he speaks of the plundering, 
to where he tells of how the Captain, having died 
several days before, was brought on the Georgia 
while Maury read the service over the body and consigned it to the deep by the flames of the dead man's 
own vessel. What noble, tender, manly hearts it 
shows, those rough seamen stopping in their work of 
destruction to perform the last rites over their dead 
enemy. One can fancy their bare heads and sun 
burned faces standing in solemn silence around the 
poor dead man when he dropped into his immense 
grave. God bless the "pirates"!
