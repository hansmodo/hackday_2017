Sir, 
</p><p>
I wrote to you yesterday by Captain Bulkley, directing you to march with all the troops you can collect 
under your command, and form a junction at Clapp's, 
in King Street, with Colonel Sheldon, who is to be at 
that place on the "id instant. I am now to inform you, 
that you will also be joined at the same time and place 
by the French legion, under the command of the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='co-worker'>Duke De Lauzun</a>, who is a brigadier in the service of his 
Most Christian Majesty, and an officer of distinction, 
long service, and merit. The Duke is to command all 
the troops, that will be assembled at the point mentioned. You will therefore be pleased on his arrival to 
put yourself and troops under his orders and command, 
he being furnished with my instructions for his movement subsequent to meeting you at Clapp's. 
</p><p>
As the Duke will be a stranger to that part of the 
country, which is to be the scene of your operations, 
it will be in vour power to give him much assistance 
and information, which I have not a doubt but you will 
do with the greatest cheerfulness and alacrity. The 
service, to which you will be called, requires great precaution, attention, and despatch. I am. Sir, &,c.
