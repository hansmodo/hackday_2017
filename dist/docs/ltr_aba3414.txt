MY DEAR LUCY, 
</p><p>
I have not yet noticed your obliging favor of April 
26th, which reached me by Captain Lyde, whilst 
I was at the Bath Hotel. I had then so much upon 
my hands, that I did not get time to write but to 
your mamma and cousin, who I hope is with you 
before now. By him I wrote many letters, and 
amongst the number of my friends, my dear Lucy 
was not omitted. 
</p><p>
If I did not believe my friends were partial to all 
I write, I should sometimes feel discouraged when I 
take my pen ; for, amongst so large a number of correspondents, I feel at a loss how to supply them all. 
</p><p>
It is usual at a large entertainment, to bring the 
solid food in the first course. The second consists 
of lighter diet, kickshaws, trifles, whip syllabub, 
&c. ; the third is the dessert, consisting of the fruits 
of the season, and sometimes foreign sweetmeats. 
If it would not be paying my letters too great a 
compliment to compare any of them to solid food, I 
should feel no reluctance at keeping up the metaphor with respect to the rest. Yet it is not the 
studied sentence, nor the elaborate period, which 
pleases, but the genuine sentiments of the heart expressed with simplicity. All the specimens, which 
have been handed down to us as models for letterwriting, teach us that natural ease is the greatest 
beauty of it. It is that native simplicity too, which 
gives to the Scotch songs a merit superior to all 
others. My favourite Scotch sons;, " There 's na luck 
about the house," will naturally occur to your mind. 
</p><p>
I believe Richardson has done more towards embellishing the present age, and teaching them the 
talent of letter-writing, than any other modern I can 
name. You know I am passionately fond of all his 
works, even to his " Pamela." In the simplicity of 
our manners, we judge that many of his descriptions and some of his characters are beyond real life ; 
but those, who have been conversant in these old corrupted countries, will be soon convinced that Richardson painted only the truth in his abandoned characters ; and nothing beyond what human nature is 
capable of attaining, and frequently has risen to, 
in his amiable portraits. Richardson was master of 
the human heart ; he studied and copied nature ; 
he has shown the odiousness of vice, and the fatal 
consequences which result from the practice of it ; 
he has painted virtue in all her amiable attitudes ; 
he never loses sight of religion, but points his characters to a future state of restitution as the sure 
ground of safety to the virtuous, and excludes not 
hope from the wretched penitent. The oftener I 
have read his books, and the more I reflect upon his 
great variety of characters, perfectly well supported, 
the more I am led to love and admire the author. 
He must have an abandoned, wicked, and depraved 
heart, who can be tempted to vice by the perusal of Richardson's works. Indeed, I know not how a 
person can read them without being made better by 
them, as they dispose the mind to receive and relish 
every good and benevolent principle. He may 
have faults, but they are so few, that they ought not 
to be named in the brilliant clusters of beauties 
which ornament his works. The human mind is an 
active principle, always in search of some gratification ; and those writings which tend to elevate it to 
the contemplation of truth and virtue, and to teach 
it that it is capable of rising to higher degrees of 
excellence than the mere gratification of sensual 
appetites and passions, contribute to promote its 
mental pleasures, and to advance the dignity of our 
natures. Sir Joshua Reynolds's observation with 
respect to painting may be applied to all those works 
which tend to refine the taste, " which, if it does not 
lead directly to purity of manners, obviates, at least, 
their greatest depravation, by disentangling the mind 
from appetite, and conducting the thoughts through 
successive stages of excellence, till that contemplation of universal rectitude and harmony, which began 
by taste, may, as it is exalted and refined, conclude 
in virtue." 
</p><p>
Why may we not suppose, that, the higher our attainments in knowledge and virtue are here on earth, 
the more nearly we assimilate ourselves to that 
order of hemes who now rank above us in the world 
of spirits ? We are told in Scripture, that there are 
different kinds of glory, and that one star differeth 
from another. Why should not those who have distinguished themselves by superior excellence over 
their fellow-mortals continue to preserve their rank 
when admitted to the kingdom of the just ? Though 
the estimation of worth may be very different in the 
view of the righteous Judge of the world from that 
which vain man esteems such on earth, yet we may 
rest assured that justice will be strictly administered 
to us. 
</p><p>
But whither has my imagination wandered ? Very 
distant from my thoughts when I first took my pen. 
</p><p>
We have a large company to dine with us to-day, 
and I have some few arrangements to make before 
dinner, which obliges me to hasten to a conclusion ; 
among the persons invited, is a gentleman who married the only daughter of Richardson. She died 
about six months ago. This gentleman has in his 
possession the only portrait of her father which was 
ever taken. He has several times invited me to go 
to his house and see it. I design it, though I have 
not yet accepted his invitation. 
</p><p>
Write to me, my dear Lucy, and be assured I 
speak the words of truth and soberness when I tell 
you that your letters give real pleasure to 
</p><p>
Your affectionate aunt, 
</p><p>
A. A.
