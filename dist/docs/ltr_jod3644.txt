MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YESTERDAY only I received yours of March 1. I 
am surprised you should have received none from me 
from 11th February. I have written never less than 
once a week, seldom less than twice, and nine weeks 
out of ten three times, ever since I left you. The roads, or some irregularity of the post, must have occasioned your disappointment. I hope you will obtain Mr. Hears, but I must leave every thing to you. 
The load of business that now compels my attention 
every day is such, that I cannot think a moment about 
my farm. Mr. Maund writes me that he has sent 
me a barrel of seed oats, of a superior quality, to 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, by a Captain Allen, who was to sail in the be 
ginning of March from Virginia. The family is gone. 
Mr. Lear and Mr. Dandridge remain, but it is a great 
work to arrange and clean the house. I can t get 
into it before the middle of next week. I hope Billings will sow the barley and grass seed well. What 
will become of my meadow cornfield I know not. 
However, I must leave that and all the rest to you, 
and I could not trust it better. 
</p><p>
My aunt Vesey's death was unknown to me. I am 
very glad you went to the funeral. The feast that 
succeeded was one of those things which are not 
much to my taste. I am glad you went. I went too. 
But these things give offence to the plain people of 
our country upon whose friendship I have always de 
pended. They are practised by the elegant and the 
rich for their own ends, which are not always the 
best. If I could have my wish, there should never 
be a show or a feast made for the President while I 
hold the office. My birthday happens when Congress will never sit, so that I hope it will never be talked of. These are hints, entre nous. I am, my 
dearest friend, 
</p><p>
Ever yours, 
</p><p>

Washington has at last denounced the forged letters.
