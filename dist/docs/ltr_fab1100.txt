Yours of the 24th came duly to hand, although I waited a long time for it. I had about given you up, but that made it the more interesting when it did come. To-day it rains and business is awfully dull, so to keep busy I will answer your letter. Now that we have started right lets keep so. I shall not write you until you have answered mine if it is three months, and you may do the same. It's not such a great job for you to write me once a month. Take Sunday for it. When I have nothing to do I had rather be writing than not.

I am sorry to hear that you could not get through Thanksgiving without a row with your Mother. You must humor her, Mary, in all her fancies, but I guess it's of no great account anyway. I had heard from R. P. B. that Father was going to Lynn but did not believe it. On some accounts I am sorry that he has sold his house. We have a great many pleasant associations connected with it and no other place that he can go to will ever seem like home. But if he can do better to emigrate, I say go, but while he is about it he had better go to California. Have you read the account from there about the Gold? There
is no humbug about it. I have seen letters from Captains whom I know, who write that their men have all run away and are digging up $20 a day, PURE GOLD, for some of it has been sent home. It has created a real fever here. Two steamships sailed yesterday and there are five vessels advertised for California. Several young men of my acquaintance are going out and you need not be at all surprised to hear of my going. I shall not go unless I can get some chance in trade to fall back on, but if I only had about $1000 to invest in goods, wouldn't I sail! (Oh, Poverty, thou art a crime!) But I shall wait my time.

To come back to your epistle. There is no danger of my rooming with Tim. He will stop with his uncle as I supposed. I am as much disgusted with him as you can be, although I treat him as a friend. He is a most artful deceiver, but I have found him out. I know some things about him which he little dreams of, but I spare his feelings. If he thought I knew it we should be enemies at once. I am in the confidence of a certain young lady in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a> who has shown me certain documents with his name attached and she has it in her power to bring an action for breach of promise at any time. All this has been transacted since his engagement with Ann, during last summer. I wish you could read one letter. I should like to have Ann see it! Oh, Lord!--wouldn't there be a row. Now, Mary, don't say that I never make you my confident, and let me see if you will betray me, for I am the only person in the secret and if Ann and Tim wish to marry, let them do it and then find out these things afterward. We have nothing to say about it.

Miss Wallace is no more to me than a half dozen others I flirt with. I don't go the whole figure as Tim does, and engage myself to every young lady I fancy. I don't think that is exactly right, even if I could succeed in doing it. I don't think of noosing myself for the present.

I have become very industrious lately. We have gotten up a class in French and meet two evenings in the week at Doctor Pond's and Baldwin's. Harriet and her brother belong to it. Ten in all at two dollars apiece. We have a Frenchman for a teacher who teaches us to speak and write it. I am very much interested in it and am determined to master it. I have stopped loafing around the city and it costs much less to spend my evenings in this manner, besides, I am getting some solid benefit. What an accomplished brother you will have! I am fast getting initiated into the mysteries of the polka and the redowa, all the rage in the ballroom, and when I get so as to 'Parley-vous Francais'--Je n'ai pas peur ni honte. I shall forget my Yankee origin. But I shall never forget you, my dear sister. You seem to write as though I were in fault in this respect, but you are dearer to me the longer I live without seeing you. I wish we could live near each other but our paths diverge from each other for the present.

The latest excitement is the row at the Opera between the manager and Benedetti, the tenor. There was a rich scene, not mentioned in the bills, that took place the other night. Mr. Frey lammed Benedetti in the face and Benedetti made a pass at him with his sword. I will send you the papers with a full account.
