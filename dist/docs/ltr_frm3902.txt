SIR: 
</p><p>
Yours by Mr. Cest came to hand. I wrote per Dragoon respecting 
Capt. Howell and the flag. Messrs. Doughty and Ancruni are not to do 
duty your way. I shall have such men returned as have served their 
month. I cannot send you the militia law; have none by me. I wrote 
you before that Capt. Weyman had it, and you might get it from him. 
I sent Capt. Stephens to <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, only to stay until his corps re 
turned. I wrote the Governor respecting Mr. Wayne's account, and think he is rather impatient. I have had no answer yet to my letters, 
and hope you will make yourself easy until I can fully satisfy you, 
which will be as soon as I get an answer from the General. I have 
some accounts of the enemy's coming over to St. Thomas , and wish I 
had every horse you have that can be of any service, as I find I am 
under the necessity of attacking them. 
</p><p>
I am, your obedient servant,
