DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Yesterday I arrived here, having previously done 
all in my power to forward on the militia from the 
Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut, upwards of six 
thousand of which I hope are in the Jerseys before 
this time. 
</p><p>
There are, at this place and in the vicinity, about two 
thousand men, part of six thousand ordered from the 
New England States. The others are on their march, 
and expected in, in a few days. The enemy's force on 
Rhode Island, by the best intelligence, is five or six 
thousand; one half foreigners, and some few invalids. 
We are informed, by several persons who left New 
port within a few days, that <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a> is going 
home in the Asia, and has sent his baggage on board, 
and that the troops have orders to hold themselves 
in readiness to embark at a minute's notice, perhaps for <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I believe they have no intention of 
penetrating the country at present. I beg leave, 
though late, to congratulate your Excellency on your success at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>. It was a most happy stroke, and has greatly raised the sinking spirits of the country. 
</p><p>
We this minute have advice, by a letter from Governor Turnbull, of your further success near Prince 
ton; and report says, Generals Putnam and Mifflin 
have killed and taken two regiments near Bristol. 
We believe this true, as the intelligence comes from 
Newport. People in general are in high spirits. 
This seems a most favorable crisis to dislodge the 
enemy from the country. Heaven grant your Excellency may be able to effect it, and may peace and 
laurels crown your successes ! 
</p><p>
About twelve or fifteen hundred of the enemy are 
dispersed in all the farm-houses on Rhode Island. As 
soon as the militia arrives, I hope we shall be able 
to give a good account of some of them. 
</p><p>
I beg leave to recommend to your Excellency, Captain Samuel Mansfield, to command a company of 
artillery. He was a Lieutenant of artillery last sum 
mer in the Northern Department, and afterwards Captain of a galley in two actions, and behaved with 
great prudence and bravery. Being anxious to continue in the service, and much wanted here, I have 
desired him to engage a number of men. If your 
Excellency should think proper to appoint him, his 
company will be soon filled up, and I dare be responsible for his conduct. 
</p><p>
A Quartermaster is much wanted here. One is appointed by the State for their own troops, but they 
are not able to furnish him with cash. I am, clear General, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>.
