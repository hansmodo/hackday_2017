The fog has often been so heavy that we could see but a little way off, and at night it fell so thick that it soon penetrated through the thickest clothes, but it cleared away early this morning and the sun shone with unrivalled brilliancy. A strong wind wafted us along smartly until this evening, when it almost ceased and we are now moving along at only three knots per hour, but this is the rate the Captain desires her to go, for he is fearful that his reckoning is wrong. He supposed yesterday that he was several miles from shore, and accordingly sail was shortened at dark last evening and the signal light hung out. At eight o'clock they hove the lead without finding any soundings. His chronometer has been leading him astray for a long time and he can place no reliance upon it, but this morning he had a fair opportunity to take a lunar observation and he now hopes to be about forty miles from the entrance of the harbor in the morning, and to reach the harbor tomorrow.

This afternoon all eyes were eagerly directed shoreward. Some asserted that a dim outline of land could be discerned while others could see nothing but clouds. Various preparations are being made by the passengers to land immediately. Today I finished drying some
clothes which I washed on Monday. This I hope is the last washing I shall ever have occasion to do in salt water.
