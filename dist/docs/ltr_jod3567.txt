MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE this minute received your favor of the 22d. 
The report of the President's resignation is probably 
designed to prevent the rise of the stocks ; but the 
insolence which appears every day in Bache's and Freneau's papers, proceeding from the same persons 
who are tired of abusing me, may be carried to a 
point that he will not bear. He has not been used to 
such threshing, and his skin is thinner than mine. 
</p><p>
Citizen H. and Citizen A. I presume will grace 
the civic feast. Cit and Citess is to come instead of 
Gaffer and- Gammer, Goody and Gooden, Mr. and Mrs., I suppose. 
</p><p>
Congress, I presume, will not sit after the second 
of March. I shall not be able to set off till the 5th, 
but I will not wait, if I travel but ten miles a day. 
We shall see, in a few months, the new French constitution, which may last twelve months, but probably not more than six. Robespierre and Marat, with 
their Jacobin supporters, I suspect, will overthrow the 
fabric which Condorcet, Paine and Brissot will erect. 
Then we shall see what they, in their turn, will erect. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Washington requests me to present to you her 
very particular regards. Many other ladies do the 
same. Citizen Briesler and Citizen V. P. are very 
happy together. Since they are equal and on a level, 
it is proper that sometimes, one should be named first, 
and sometimes, the other. Our countrymen are 
about to abandon the good old, grave, solid manners 
of Englishmen, their ancestors, and adopt all the 
apery, levity, and frivolity, of the French. 
fa ira. 
</p><p>
Tenderly yours, 
</p><p>
