DEAR SIR 
</p><p>
I am very sensible of the honour done me by your House of 
Representatives, in appointing me their Agent here. It will 
make me extreamly happy, if I can render them any valuable 
Service. I have had several Conferences with Mr. Bollan 
on their Affairs. 
</p><p>
There is a good Understanding between us which I shall 
endeavour to cultivate. At present the Cloud, that threatened our Charter Liberties, seems to be blown over. In 
time, I hope harmony will be restored between the two 
Countries, by leaving us in the full possession and enjoyment 
of our Rights. 
</p><p>
It will be a great pleasure to me if I can be any way useful 
to your Son while he stays in England ; being with the greatest 
Esteem and Respect for you and Mrs. Bowdoin, dear Sir, 
Your most obedient & most humble Servant 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. Inclos'd I send you a Copy of an original Paper of 
some curiosity now in my hands. The first part, i.e. the 
Queries you will find in the papers pertaining to the Governor's 
History, but not the Abstract or state given with them to <a href='/results.php?tla=edp' rel=''>Mr. Randolph</a>.
