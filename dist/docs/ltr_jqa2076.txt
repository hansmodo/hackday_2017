THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, May 22, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
My last letter acknowledged the receipt of your favor 
of February n. That of December has since reached me. 
By the same opportunity I have letters from my brother 
Charles of March 12. And I have seen <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> papers to 
the ist of April. Our information from America is yet 
generally indirect and our means of conveyance few, difficult and uncertain. 
</p><p>
The appointment which places me here is undoubtedly 
respectable, much beyond the line of my pretensions, and 
the advantage of seeing Europe at the present moment is 
personally a subject of particular gratification to me. The 
situation which I was obliged to abandon for this gave me 
nothing, or very little in possessions, but a fair and rational 
prospect, infinitely more pleasing than those now before me. 
My sacrifice was merely of an expectancy, but a very valuable one in every point of view. It was independence, 
usefulness and personal consideration ; but above all the 
increasing attachment of friends, which every probability 
led me to expect would be durable. The benefit of your 
advice and instructions, the society however interrupted 
and partial of my mother and the rest of the family, though 
I feel severely the loss of them, were yet so inevitable and 
of impossible consistency with an absence beyond the 
Atlantic, that I do not reckon them in the account. 
</p><p>
As it respects my country that has certainly gained 
nothing by the exchange. To speak the sentiments of my 
heart without equivocation, an American Minister at the 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a> is one of the most useless beings in creation. The 
whole corps diplomatique here, according to a late French 
production of considerable merit, n est plus qu une Assemblee 
de nouvellistes, and the actor must have not an humble 
but a degraded idea of himself, who can be satisfied with the 
part of receiving the pay of a nation for the purpose of 
penetrating the contents of a newspaper. 
</p><p>
As a single private individual I flatter myself that my 
mite of contribution to the public service in America was 
more valuable than any that I can render at present. The 
retribution is equally inconsistent with propriety. At present I am liberally paid for no service at all. There my 
only reward for considerable labor, and some political 
courage, was abuse, sometimes upon myself which was of 
very little consequence to me, but much more frequently 
upon an object entitled to all the veneration of the whole 
people, as much as he was possessed of mine, and who was 
persecuted for my offences with a malignancy and a brutality such as among mankind is experienced only by virtue 
and integrity; but which real crimes and infamy are too 
much respected ever to suffer. 
</p><p>
At length, after four months of suspense upon the fate of 
this country, a treaty to acknowledge the independence and 
sovereignty of the Batavian people without a Stadtholder 
was signed on the i/th instant, by two members of the 
French Committee of Public Safety (Rewbell and Sieyes), 
and four deputies from the States General. 
</p><p>
This treaty will undoubtedly be published in the American newspapers before my letter can reach you, and I hope 
it will be a subject of serious reflection to every American. 
It shows in the clearest light at what price the friendship 
and assistance of France as a Republic is estimated by her 
own government. Let it be remembered that from the 
commencement of the war they have declared themselves 
the enemies of the Stadtholder and his government, but the 
friends and allies of the Dutch people. These friends and 
allies, after considering this territory durin-g four months 
as a conquest, and treating it accordingly, though with all 
possible civility and some generosity, finally exact as conditions for acknowledging the liberty and independence of 
their friends and allies, a very considerable dismemberment 
of territory, a perpetual pledec of political subserviency, 
and one hundred million of florins in cash. Non tali auxilio. 
</p><p>
These facts are the more deserving of consideration, 
because I have several reasons to suppose that the policy 
of the French government at present is to make use of the 
United States, as they are now making use of these Provinces, that is, as an instrument for the benefit of France, 
as a passive weapon in her hands against her most formidable enemy. Being at a distance from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> and having no 
regular connection with any members of that government, 
I am unable to trace the causes of my suspicions to a very 
certain source. I have not the means of ascertaining any 
considerable variety of facts, from the combination of 
which a conclusion to warrant any affirmative declaration 
could be drawn, and the communication with France itself 
is so liable to accident, that I am unable to correspond with 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague">Mr. Monroe</a> so confidentially as would be necessary to 
determine how far my conjectures are founded. 
</p><p>
From the occurrences of the last year, it is certain that a 
prodigious alteration in the relative position of the Euro 
pean powers towards one another has taken place. The 
centre of combination has been equally removed by the 
victories of France and by the misfortunes of Poland. The 
drunken madness of political fanaticism has subsided surprisingly. The ruin of France remains therefore the only 
centre of union to the coalesced powers, but this principle 
is no less repulsive on one side than it is attractive on the 
other. New interests have arisen to form different combinations from those of the war as it began, and they have 
already been productive of a considerable revolution of 
policy, discovered in many public events and distinguishable 
from other circumstances. 
</p><p>
The tendency of these new interests is to unite the efforts 
of Austria, Russia and Britain, for the present moment, in 
one common pursuit ; but it unites equally all the rest of 
Europe against them. 
</p><p>
This combination is unquestionably formidable, and it 
has an immense advantage in the pecuniary resources of 
Great Britain. They remain at least for present occasion 
in undiminished vigor, while those of France are exhausted 
in proportion to the violence of those exertions that have 
acquired her splendid triumphs. 
</p><p>
It is not to be doubted but that France intends to unite 
against her three remaining rivals and enemies as many 
European powers as possible. The policy has been indeed 
clearly discovered in speeches made to the National Convention by members of the Executive Committee, in which 
mention has escaped of nations " which had observed 
neutrality, wise in its principle, but which has become 
insufficient," where subsidies to be given for the purpose of 
causing a diversion have been suggested, and where numerous objections have been made to prove that Spain, Prussia 
and Holland are all deeply interested in the future success 
of the French cause. 
</p><p>
The intention of employing the United States likewise as 
an useful enemy to Great Britain has not been so openly 
avowed. And long since the arrival of the French armies 
in this country, the Representatives with whom I have had 
occasion to converse have declared themselves to be entirely 
satisfied with the neutrality of the United States. They do 
not at present say expressly the contrary, but they observe, 
that it is very extraordinary that the treaty signed by Mr. 
Jay last November should yet be kept secret. 
</p><p>
It is impossible that they should imagine there is any 
thing in that treaty with which France can have any pretence to interfere. It is therefore the treaty itself, which 
does not suit these views, because they consider it as the 
means of terminating differences, which their own interest 
leads them to wish may terminate in a rupture. 
</p><p>
If these conjectures have as much foundation as I apprehend, the whole French influence in America will exert 
itself with more than usual activity to prevent the ratification of the treaty, and to produce at all events a war between the United States and Great Britain, not assuredly 
from regard to our interest, which they respect as much as 
they do that of their friends and allies the Hollanders, but 
because they are sensible of how much importance our 
commerce is to Great Britain, and suppose that the loss 
of it would make that nation outrageous for peace, and 
compel the Minister to make it upon the terms they are 
disposed to dictate. 
</p><p>
It was probably the intention of the Brissotine party, the 
Executive Council, who sent Genet to America to involve 
the United States in a war with Britain, but in such a manner 
as should be imperceptible to ourselves, as should have the 
appearance of being entirely a war of our own, and should 
leave France free from all engagements, in full liberty to 
make her own peace, whenever she might think proper, 
and leave us to extricate ourselves as we could. This plan 
was not successful in its execution, and perhaps was abandoned by the Executive Committee, which rose upon the 
ruins of the Council. To them the neutrality of the United 
States was at least as beneficial as any assistance they could 
expect from them in a state of war, or at least by appearing to 
pursue a different policy, they meant to make it an instrument of odium against the party they had then defeated. 
That Committee has been sacrificed in its turn. Every 
thing done by them is an object of execration. They are 
Jacobins, Terrorists, Royalists, drinkers of blood, robbers, 
scourges of the human race, everything that a victorious 
party can make of one that is defeated. The truth of the 
fact seems to be that the Brissotine party have resumed 
their superiority in the Convention, and have derived among 
the people some consideration, more from the detestation of 
their predecessors, than from their own merits. They have 
resumed the principles and the policy, which the decem-viral government had abandoned, and among the rest per 
haps the design of fomenting a war between America and 
Great Britain. They have sent to America a new minister, 
to take the place of Fauchet ; a man, who has been hereto 
fore employed by them in their revolutionary manoeuvres 
at Geneva, and who, as one of the Representatives lately a 
member of the Committee of Public Safety told me, was substituted instead of the other, whose "talents and experience 
are found to be not equal to the importance of the mission." 
</p><p>
I have considered it as an indispensable duty that I owe 
to my country to express to you, Sir, my ideas and suspicions upon a subject of so much importance : in my public 
correspondence I have scarcely hinted at them, because 
they are but suspicions, and because there is another source, 
from which more accurate information is to be expected, 
and will doubtless be received. At least if my conjectures 
are groundless they will be harmless, because the state of 
affairs in America will prove them to be fallacious. If 
they are well founded, it may not be useless that the symptoms breaking forth in this quarter of the world should be 
known to you, and combined with those that will discover 
themselves in America. 
</p><p>
If their present views really are to draw the United States 
into a war with Britain, their only motive for it must be 
to accelerate their own peace. The general sentiment of 
the French at the present moment, if I mistake not, is less 
cordial towards the Americans than it has been. They envy 
us the immense advantage we have derived from our neutrality ; they think we have grown rich upon their impoverishment; that we have drained them of their specie, and 
they do not scruple to charge our merchants who have 
supplied their most urgent necessities, with having taken 
advantage of their wants to extort extravagant profits upon 
their commerce. Peace has become an object of extreme 
necessity to them ; their finances, their commerce, their 
manufactures, their agriculture, their population, all by 
an inseparable chain are connected in a dependence upon 
the return of peace. Yet the brilliancy of their victories, 
and especially the security of the prevailing party, make it 
indispensably necessary to them to insist upon conditions, 
to which their enemies in the present state of affairs will 
certainly not submit. It is for their benefit alone, there 
fore, that they wish to see us engaged, and should they 
succeed in this intention the principal, perhaps the only 
use they will make of their success will be to obtain more 
glorious terms of peace for themselves. 
</p><p>
The President of the United States has so decidedly 
adopted and maintained the policy of neutrality, and it has 
proved so advantageous to the country, that it is perhaps 
an idle apprehension that can imagine it will again be 
endangered. Before this letter reaches you, the question 
upon the ratification of the treaty signed in November will 
undoubtedly be decided. The die will be cast ; the point 
of peace or enmity with Britain settled. If by a ratification 
of the treaty, perhaps a coolness on the part of France will 
again be discernible, but from which no ill consequences 
whatever are to be dreaded. If the treaty should be 
rejected, the French influence and French intrigue, always 
so active and powerful among us, will become much more 
busy than they have ever been before. 
</p><p>
On the first supposition their disappointment will have no 
serious consequence, because they have still great need of 
our supplies, because the policy of their government under 
every possible variation will always be to conform the 
style of their pretentions in their political relations with 
us to the degree of firmness or of acquiescence discovered 
on our part, and because our friendship and neutrality must 
be more agreeable and advantageous to them than a state 
of variance. Failing in their favorite object, they will 
eventually content themselves with that which they con 
sider as the next best, and very possibly the situation of 
their internal concerns may once more make it the interest 
of a prevailing faction to alter the system of external policy, 
in order by the restoration of cordiality with their neighbors, 
to cast an odium upon their rivals at home. 
</p><p>
If the treaty should not be ratified, the French will exert 
themselves for the purpose of hurrying us into a war, which 
may hasten their means of making peace, and in which they 
may be under no obligation of making a common cause with 
us. Their partizans, perhaps, in declamations or in news 
papers will promise wonders from their co-operation ; their 
official characters possibly may employ a great number of 
what they call phrases, but will have no power to contract 
any substantial engagements ; we shall be friends, brothers, 
allies, fellow-freemen, loaded with all the tenderness of 
family affections introduced by a political prosopopeia 
into national concerns, and the final result of the whole 
matter will be, that all this tender sympathy, this amiable 
fraternity, this lovely coalescence of liberty, will leave us 
the advantage of being sacrificed to their interests, or of 
purchasing their protection upon the most humiliating and 
burdensome conditions, and at the same time of being 
reduced to the condition of glorying in our disgrace, and 
hailing the instrument of our calamity as the weapon of our deliverance. 
</p><p>
I wish that the situation of affairs in America may be 
such as shall afford a full demonstration, that these are 
ideas merely visionary, and above all I wish that we may 
never have occasion for any political connections in Europe. 
The alarming prospects of famine, which threaten every 
part of this hemisphere, may perhaps contribute more than 
any other circumstance to a general pacification, which if 
it should be effected will in truth be nothing more than a 
suspension of arms. 
</p><p>
The internal state of France is critical, and will probably 
experience a considerable change in the course of the present 
year. It is impossible, however, to anticipate at this distance what turn it will take. They are weary of their 
revolutionary government, and universally convinced that 
the Constitution which has been accepted can never be 
carried into execution in its present state. As they do not 
yet venture to lay it entirely aside, they have contrived 
to propose a supplementary addition under the name of 
organic laws. A committee of eleven members has been 
chosen by the Convention to prepare them and the result 
of their labors will soon be presented to the Assembly. The 
weakness of their present government is the principal subject of complaint at this time, and the principles of moderation are found incompetent to repress the movements of 
popular indignation and revenge. The execution of sixteen 
persons formerly composing part of the revolutionary tribunal under the government of Robespierre, has recently 
taken place at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> with the sanction of legal forms, but 
at Lyons the impatience of the people has anticipated the 
decision of justice, and on the 4th of this month the sanctuary of the prisons was again violated, and sixty or seventy 
persons were sacrificed by the people, as an atonement for 
the cruelties of which they had been heretofore the principal agents. 
I am, &c.
