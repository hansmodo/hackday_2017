All that is talked about here now is the French Revolution. There are a great many French in the city and they are perfectly mad with joy. They met on the Battery yesterday and fired one hundred guns and the Tricolor flag is flying in all parts of the city. Success to them, I say.

You probably know what I wrote Father about going into business. I think it will be better than clerking it, even if I make no more than my expenses the first year, which is all that I expect to do as business is very dull just now. However, I shall be in the way of learning business more than I should as a clerk. I believe it is some time since you have written me. I think it likely there is a letter on the way.

Remember me to Mother. Tell her that it is so much trouble to send to B. that I shall get my shirts made here to order, besides it is coming warmer weather and I think that I shall button my coat up to my chin and wear a paper collar and thus save a shirt altogether.

P.S. John Jacob Astor is dead. Hope he left me half his property.
