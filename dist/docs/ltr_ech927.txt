Dear Ellen:--We did not sail today as we anticipated when I last saw you, but expect to sail next Tuesday morning. The longer the vessel delays now, the worse it will be for me. Were it not for sweet hope in the future this trial would break me down; and this morning, as it is, my heart has been heavy. Mr. Prizer is down here but will be at West Chester this evening and will give you this letter.
</p><p>
Last evening I was up to see your sister and I must return my thanks to you for the cordial welcome with which I was received. She furnished me with a list which I found very valuable.
</p><p>
I had a daguerreotype likeness taken, which will be sent to you with this. Take it, and may it ever be a source of comfort to you. Should I have the good luck ever to return, I hope the mutual pledges given by us may be fulfilled, and believe me that I cannot change. My feelings at parting now, you can better imagine than I can describe.
</p><p>
If I can write opposite New Castle, I shall. And do not, on your part, fail to write frequently.
</p><p>
Your likeness will be stored away in the safest place and the original, unless memory is false to her duty,
be remembered with all the ardor of one who is proud and happy to subscribe himself dearest,
</p><p>
Ever yours,
</p><p>
