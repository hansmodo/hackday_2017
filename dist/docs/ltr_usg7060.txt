MAJOR-GENERAL H. W. HALLECK, 
</p><p>
General-in-Chief: 
</p><p>
Despatches just received from <a href='/results.php?tla=jms' rel='co-worker'>General Schofield</a> and conversation with General Foster, who is now here, have determined me 
against moving immediately against <a href='/results.php?tla=jml' rel='colleague adversary met'>Longstreet</a>. I will write more fully. No danger whatever to be apprehended in East Tennessee. 
</p><p>
U. S. GRANT, 
</p><p>
Major- General.
