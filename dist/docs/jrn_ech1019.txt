This morning we moved on a few and encamped upon a small stream of water within less than a mile of where some two or three hundred workmen are engaged digging and washing out the precious ore. We were a little over five days on our journey from San Joaquin City to this place and we supposse we have made about eighty or eighty-five miles. Our long voyage at sea unfitted us for such a tramp and hence we have been almost worn out, but a day or two's rest, we hope, will restore our usual vigor. For the past few days Atkins was apparently improving rapidly, but today he took a relapse and I fear he may have a hard sickness. He is just able to keep out of bed, and is down in spirits a little.

There are four or five tents near our own, belonging to emigrants who came across the plains, all hardy, industrious fellows well suited for this kind of life. After dinner we strolled out to the diggings and there saw large numbers at work, digging, washing in rockers and pans, and draining out water, for a long distance along a mountain rivulet. These diggings are known as Burns'
on account of a gentleman of that name owning a large ranch farm a short distance off.

On our return from the diggings to camp we happened in a provision store, made of canvas, of course, for there are none others within many miles. We purchased 12 lbs. of pork at 50 cents, 2 1/2 pounds of navy bread at 75 cents and one pound of brown sugar at 62 1/2 cents. To exhibit the state of our financial affairs, I need only state that I arrived in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> with $27 in my pocket and my comrade with even less, but by selling our provisions, a lot of clothes, and his tools, we raised about $85 apiece. Now I have twenty-seven dollars and each of my partners less.
