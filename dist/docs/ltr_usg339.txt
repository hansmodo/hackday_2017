DEAR FATHER:
</p><p>
The memorandums you left with me relative to bounty due two needy
persons in Covington I attended to soon after you left here. The answer
of the Paymaster General was that under no circumstances could he take
up claims for bounty out of turn; therefore, it was not satisfactory to
you. I neglected to answer at the time and the matter escaped my memory
until now.
</p><p>
I spoke to Secretary McCulloch about giving Mrs. Porter a clerkship in
the Treasury and he promised me he would do it, but has not yet. Now, I
fancy, I would not have much influence, and if I had, would be very
careful about using it.
</p><p>
The family are well and send much love to Mother, Jennie and yourself.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.
