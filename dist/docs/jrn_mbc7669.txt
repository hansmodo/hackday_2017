<a rel='month origin' value='10'>October</a> <a rel='day origin' value='24'>24th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=camden' rel='city origin'>CAMDEN</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1863' rel="origin">1863</a>]. James Chesnut is at home on his way back to Richmond; had been sent by the President to 
make the rounds of the Western armies; says Polk is a splendid old fellow. They accuse him of having been 
asleep in his tent at seven o clock when he was ordered to attack at daylight, but he has too good a conscience to sleep so soundly.

The battle did not begin until eleven at Chickamauga when Bragg had ordered the advance at daylight. Bragg 
and his generals do not agree. I think a general worthless whose subalterns quarrel with him. Something is wrong 
about the man. Good generals are adored by their soldiers. See Napoleon, Caesar, Stonewall, <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>Lee</a>. 
</p><p>
Old Sam (Hood) received his orders to hold a certain bridge against the enemy, and he had already driven the 
enemy several miles beyond it, when the slow generals were still asleep. <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> has won a victory, though he has only 
one leg to stand on.

Mr. Chesnut was with the President when he reviewed our army under the enemy's guns before Chattanooga. He 
told <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis</a> that every honest man he saw out West thought well of <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston</a>. He knows that the President detests <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston</a> for all the trouble he has given him, and General Joe returns the compliment with compound 
interest. His hatred of Jeff Davis amounts to a religion. With him it colors all things. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston</a> advancing, or retreating, I may say with more truth, is magnetic. He does draw the good-will of 
those by whom he is surrounded. Being such a good hater, it is a pity he had not elected to hate somebody else than 
the President of our country. He hates not wisely but too well. Our friend Breckinridge received Mr. Chesnut with 
open arms. There is nothing narrow, nothing self-seeking, about Breckinridge. He has not mounted a pair of green 
spectacles made of prejudices so that he sees no good except in his own red-hot partizans.
