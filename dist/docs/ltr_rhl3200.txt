DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 17th I received yesterday, and 
was a good deal surprised to find you had been told 
that Congress had appointed General Conway a Major-General. No such appointment has been made ; nor 
do I believe it will, while it is likely to produce the 
evil consequences you suggest. It is very true, that 
both within and without doors, there have been advocates for the measure ; and it has been affirmed that 
it would be very agreeable to the army, whose favorite Mr. Conway was asserted to be. My judgment 
on this business was not formed until I received your letter. I am very sure Congress would not take any 
step that might injure the army, or even have a tendency that way; and I verily believe they wish to 
lessen your difficulties by every means in their power, 
from an entire conviction that the purest motives of 
public good direct your actions. 
</p><p>
The business of a Board of War is so extensive, 
so important, and demanding such constant attention, 
that Congress see clearly the necessity of constituting a new Board, out of Congress, whose time shall be entirely devoted to that essential department. It 
is by some warmly proposed that this Board shall 
be filled by the three following gentlemen; <a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague'>Colonel Reed</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=tip' rel='colleague'>Colonel Pickering</a>, the present Adjutant-General, and Colonel Harrison, your Secretary 5 and that 
General Conway be appointed Adjutant-General, in the 
room of <a href='/results.php?tla=tip' rel='colleague'>Colonel Pickering</a>. It is my wish, and I am 
sure it is so of many others, to know your full and 
candid sentiments on this subject. For my own part, 
I cannot be satisfied with giving any opinion on the 
point until I am favored with your sentiments, which 
I shall be much obliged to you for, Sir, as soon as 
your time will permit. It has been affirmed that 
General Conway would quit the service if he were 
not made a Major-General. But I have been told, in 
confidence, that he would leave it at the end of this 
campaign, if he was appointed, unless his word of 
honor were taken to continue for any fixed time. 
And it is a question with me, whether the advocates 
for General Conway will not miss their aim, if he 
should be appointed Adjutant-General, unless he has 
the rank of Major-General also. My reason for thinking so is, that I have been informed General Conway 
desires to retire to his family, provided he can carry 
from this country home with him a rank that will 
raise him in France.* 
</p><p>
It is very certain that the public good demands a 
speedy erecting and judicious filling of the new Board 
of War ; and I sincerely wish it may be done in the 
most proper manner. I do not imagine Congress 
would appoint Colonel Harrison without first knowing whether you could spare him; nor do I think 
that so important an office as that of Adjutant-General should be touched without maturest consideration. 
</p><p>
We every moment expect the express, with an ac 
count that will enable us to congratulate you on the 
surrender of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>, and the remains of 
his shattered army. This will be one of the Prussian 
sixes, and I augur that the other will soon cast up 
upon the Delaware. 
</p><p>
I am, with sincerest wishes for your health and 
success, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
