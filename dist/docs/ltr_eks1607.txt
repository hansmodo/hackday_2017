I arrived here a week ago today and have been detained for a train and escort to proceed to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>. 
This is the hottest and dustiest place I have ever seen. 
It is on the right or east bank of the San Juan about 
three miles from its junction with the Rio Grande. 
The banks are about thirty feet above the present 
level of the water, though in the spring it rises five or 
six feet above their crests, washing away the foundations of the houses which are principally built of stone 
one story in height. Some of them are rather imposing looking buildings and have been surrounded by 
fine gardens, orange groves, etc. Alas ! they are now 
laid waste by flood and war. The best of the inhabitants are gone. Speaking of an escort to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>, 
it is at all times unsafe for any but strong parties to 
pass through this country, and the danger, of course, 
is much increased now when it is torn by invasion. I 
have received an order from General Patterson to 
organize an escort for the supply train from the recovered sick of the regular and volunteer forces left 
here by the army now at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>. On inquiry I 
find I shall have a command of about seventy-one 
regulars and one hundred and twelve volunteers 
rank and file, with nearly twenty officers. With this 
Falstaff regiment with which I should blush to march 
through Coventry, I shall take the field in the course 
of the week and shall probably reach <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> in 
eight or nine days. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> and the valley in which 
it is situated is described by all who have seen it as 
unsurpassed in beauty, and having a climate which 
may be envied by all the rest of the world. The city, 
which usually contains about twelve thousand inhabi 
tants, is strongly fortified and stands at the foot of 
that immense range of mountains known as the Sierra 
Madre, at the outlet of the defile which leads to the 
city of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a> and on the head waters of the San 
Juan. . . . With regard to the battle I know little 
more than you will learn from the papers. The Fifth 
(in which you are particularly interested), in common 
with the rest, behaved well and did good service. Only 
one man of the regiment was killed and some twenty- 
four wounded. Rossell received a slight flesh wound. 
I wonder where the ball found flesh enough for its 
passage, without hitting the bone. Of the numerous 
occurrences of the battle field, I have only time to 
relate one which struck me as particularly affecting. 
It is connected with the death of Brevet Major Phil 
Barbour. When struck by the ball which caused his 
death in a few seconds, he immediately drew from 
his bosom his wife s miniature, opened it and exclaimed: " Tell her I died on the field of victory! " 
put it to his lips and instantly expired. . . .
