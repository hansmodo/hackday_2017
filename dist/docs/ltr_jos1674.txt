UNITED STATES SENATE, Jan. 29, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1864">1864</a>.

My Dear Brother: I received your letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lancaster" rel="city">Lancaster</a>, and also one from Cairo. If I had known when 
I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> that you were to be at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lancaster" rel="city">Lancaster</a>, I 
would have met you there. But on leaving <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> 
I engaged to meet certain gentlemen at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, on 
New Year's Day, and this left me no time. I have met 
several from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a> who saw you there, and all 
concur in saying you bear the storms of life well, and 
appear in better health and spirits than before the war. 
Your official report is very interesting, and I wish to see 
it published. I inquired of Cullen if it has yet come 
by military channels to the adjutant-general, and he says 
not. When it does come, he will have it published. As 
to your proposition to increase the cadets at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=west point" rel="city">West Point</a>, 
I find some difference of opinion among regular officers. 
Cullen says that to graduate the number would require 
new buildings, professors, etc. ; that the utmost capacity 
of the school is four hundred and fifty. Both he and 
Hardie seem backward about drawing the bill without 
the assent of Stanton, but promised to send me a bill 
doubling the cadets if Stanton would consent. This 
delicacy seems to me absurd, for I will assume it, introduce it, and may be able to pass it. ... We are all 
looking to the operation on the Mississippi and at 
Knoxville. The latter seems to me the point of danger. 
If Longstreet should be reinforced, why could he not 
pounce upon Foster, or his successor, and make another 
march necessary for his relief. The movement of recruiting is going on well enough. The draft will then 
be thoroughly enforced. So Stanton says, and I believe 
him. The general prosperity of the country is so marked 
that I am afraid of a reaction or a collapse. The currency is awfully inflated, and our ability to borrow and 
to pay interest has a limit. If the war continues two 
years longer, we shall be terribly embarrassed. Still we 
have the sure foundation of public credit/, a great country, and a large and active population/ Let me hear 
from you as often as possible. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours,
