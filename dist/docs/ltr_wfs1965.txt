My dear Colonel or rather General: 
</p><p>
I am bound to the Chatahoochee to take upon myself the direction of the war against the Creeks. Would to God that I had you & 
your effective corps to assist in putting down this new enemy. With him we shall certainly have a fight. He cannot escape & lose himself 
in hammocks, Savannahs, cypress swamps, ever glades, etc. 
</p><p>
I received your report & in sending it to the War Department made an endorsement to this effect : 
</p><p>
The only objection to this report is the disparaging manner in which the gallant colonel speaks of himself. He is a first rate officer, & 
has gone as far in the expedition entrusted to him, & covered as much ground as I had expected. No doubt he was as much distressed at not find 
ing an enemy as I am disappointed in that particular. 
</p><p>
Do not miscontrue my letter to the Adjutant General of the 3Oth ultimo that has been published. See my reply to Capt. Robertson of this 
place, dated yesterday, & which is published. 
</p><p>
In great haste 
</p><p>
Very truly yr friend 
</p><p>
WINFIELD SCOTT. 
</p><p>
I have just written to triend Lawson to join me with all speed.
