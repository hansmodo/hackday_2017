Sir, 
</p><p>
The enemy are doing what they ought to do. 
Graves, immediately after having joined Arbuthnot, 
comes to cruise before us with nine or ten ships of 
the line, five frigates, and four other small vessels. 
He moors at present at Block Island, with the object 
of opposing our designs, and intercepting the second division from France. Our despatch-boat, charged 
with letters, and escorted by three frigates, has been 
obliged to return yesterday, chased by all the enemy's fleet. I see that it "will be good to have cruisers at the Capes of Delaware and Chesapeake, to advertise our second convoy, as soon as it shall appear, 
to debark at the south, or at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ; the former will 
be best. I pray my General to transmit this to the 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague'>Chevalier De La Luzerne</a>, that he may act in consequence. 
</p><p>
We are going to try to convey our letters to France 
in a vessel from one of the ports in the State of 
Massachusetts. I wait here that part of the Bourbonne which have fortunately debarked at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. 
We have more than six hundred sick, besides one 
hundred whom the Bourbonne left at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. The 
fleet has more than one thousand sailors, and has not 
here wherewith to change them, as Graves did at 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. A good month's refreshment will reestablish the greatest part. 
</p><p>
I am, with respect, &c. &c., 
</p><p>
