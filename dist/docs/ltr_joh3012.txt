SIR, 
</p><p>
The Congress, having the greatest reason to believe there has been very gross misconduct in the management of our affairs in Canada, have come to 
a resolution to have a general inquiry made into the behaviour of the officers employed on that expedition. 
The honor of the United Colonies, and a regard for 
the public good, call loudly for such an inquiry to 
be set on foot. I am, therefore, directed to request, 
after having made the inquiry agreeably to the in-closed resolve, you will transmit the result, together 
with the proofs, to Congress.
</p><p>
The opinion that an officer cannot be tried by a 
court-martial after his resignation, for offences while 
he held a commission, so dangerous to the service, 
and particularly destructive in our army, where the 
short enlistment of the troops might furnish temptation to crimes from the prospect of impunity, has 
been this day reprobated by Congress. 
</p><p>
I have written to the Convention of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> on 
the subject of the inclosed resolve respecting another 
regiment to be raised in that Colony. The terms on 
which the commissions are to be granted are extremely well calculated to excite the officers to exert 
themselves to fill up their companies. 
</p><p>
I have likewise written to the respective Colonies, 
and have sent copies of the inclosed resolve recommending to them to provide clothes for the troops of 
their Colonies. These, or such articles of them as 
you shall want, the Congress have empowered you 
to draw for on the Assemblies and Conventions, from 
time to time, as you shall judge necessary. I have represented to them that it is totally impossible that 
the American army should ever be on a respectable 
footing, or that they should render such essential services to their country as we expect and desire, unless the United Colonies will, on their part, take care 
that they are well appointed and equipped with every 
thing necessary for an army. 
</p><p>
General "Wooster, it is the order of Congress, should 
be permitted to return to his family. 
</p><p>
I have delivered Mr. Visscher his commission as 
Lieutenant-Colonel in the regiment commanded by 
Colonel Nicholson, and directed him to wait on you, 
upon his arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
Apprehending that such of the resolves of Congress 
as respect the conduct of the army, are executed in 
consequence of orders issued by you, I have omitted 
sending to <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a> such as respect him,, 
concluding that the directions would go from you ; 
but if it will be any way a relief to you, I will continue to forward them. I have the honor to be, with 
much esteem, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President. 
</p><p>
22d. Your letter of the 20th this moment came to 
hand, and shall be laid before Congress on Monday.
