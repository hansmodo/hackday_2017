<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>, 25 June, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
MY father has been more afflicted by the destruction 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charlestown</a> than by any thing which has hereto 
fore taken place. Why should not his countenance 
be sad, when the city, the place of his father's 
sepulchre, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire? Scarcely one stone remaineth upon another ; but in the midst of sorrow we have 
abundant cause of thankfulness, that so few of our brethren are numbered with the slain, whilst our enemies were cut down like the grass before the 
scythe. But one officer of all the Welsh fusileers remains to tell his story. Many poor wretches die for want of proper assistance and care of their wounds. 
</p><p>
Every account agrees in fourteen or fifteen hundred slain and wounded upon their side, nor can I 
learn that they dissemble the number themselves. 
We had some heroes that day, who fought with 
amazing intrepidity and courage. 
</p><p>
"Extremity is the trier of spirits ; 
common chances common men can bear ; " 
And " when the sea is calm, all boats alike 
Show mastership in floating. But fortune's blows, 
When most struck home, being bravely warded, crave 
A noble cunning." 
</p><p>
I hear that General Howe has said, that the battle upon the plains of Abram was but a bauble to this. 
When we consider all the circumstances attending this action, we stand astonished that our people were not all cut off. They had but one hundred feet in 
trenched, the number who were engaged did not exceed eight hundred, and they with not half ammunition enough ; the reinforcement not able to get to 
them seasonably. The tide was up, and high, so that 
their floating batteries came upon each side of the 
causeway, and their row-galleys kept a continual fire. 
Added to this, the fire from Cops Hill, and from the 
ships ; the town in flames, all around them, and the 
heat from the flames so intense as scarcely to be 
borne ; the day one of the hottest we have had this 
season, and the wind blowing the smoke in their 
faces, only figure to yourself all these circumstances, and then consider that we do not count sixty men 
lost. My heart overflows at the recollection. 
</p><p>
We live in continual expectation of hostilities. 
Scarcely a day that does not produce some ; but, like 
good Nehemiah, having made our prayer unto God, 
and set the people with their swords, their spears, 
and their bows, we will say unto them, "Be not ye 
afraid of them ; remember the Lord, who is great 
and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons 
and your daughters, your wives and your houses." 
</p><p>
I have just received yours of the 17th of June, in 
seven days only ; every line from that far country is 
precious ; you do not tell me how you do, but I will 
hope better. Alas, you little thought what distress 
we were in the day you wrote. They delight in molesting us upon the Sabbath. Two Sabbaths we 
have been in such alarm that we have had no meeting ; this day we have sat under our own vine in 
quietness ; have heard Mr. Taft, from Psalms, " The 
Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over 
all his works." The good man was earnest and 
pathetic ; I could forgive his weakness for the sake of 
his sincerity, but I long for a Cooper and an Eliot. 
</p><p>
I want a person, who has feeling and sensibility, who can take one up with him, 
And "in his duty prompt, at every call," 
</p><p>
Can "watch, and weep, and pray, and feel for all." 
</p><p>
Mr. Rice joins <a href="/results.php?tla=wih" rel="">General Heath's</a> regiment to-morrow, as adjutant. Your brother is very desirous of 
being in the army, but your good mother is really 
violent against it. I cannot persuade nor reason her 
into a consent. Neither he nor I dare let her know 
that he is trying for a place. My brother has a 
captain's commission, and is stationed at Cambridge. 
I thought you had the best of intelligence, or I 
should have taken pains to be more particular. As 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, there are many persons yet there, who 
would be glad to get out if they could. Mr. Boylston, and Mr. Gill, the printer, with his family, are held upon the black list, it is said. Tis certain 
they watch them so narrowly, that they cannot escape. Mr. Mather got out a day or two before 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charlestown</a> was destroyed, and had lodged his papers and what else he got out, at Mr. Gary s, but 
they were all consumed ; so were many other people s, who thought they might trust their little there, 
till teams could be procured to remove them. The 
people from the almshouse and workhouse were sent 
to the lines, last week, to make room for their 
wounded, they say. Medford people are all re 
moved. Every seaport seems in motion. O North, 
may the groans and cries of the injured and oppressed harrow up thy soul. We have a prodigious army, but we lack many accommodations, which we 
need. I hope the appointment of these new generals will give satisfaction ; they must be proof against 
calumny. In a contest like this, continual reports 
are circulated by our enemies, and they catch with 
the unwary and the gaping crowd, who are ready 
to listen to the marvellous, without considering of 
consequences, even though their best friends are injured. 
</p><p>
I have not ventured to inquire one word of you 
about your return. I do not know whether I ought 
to wish for it ; it seems as if your sitting together 
was absolutely necessary, whilst every day is big 
with events. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jab" rel="acquaintance met">Mr. Bowdoin</a> called Friday, and took his leave of me, desiring I would present his affectionate regards to you. I have hopes that he will recover, he has 
mended a good deal. He wished he could have stayed in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>, but his lady was fearful. 
</p><p>
Yours evermore, 
</p><p>
