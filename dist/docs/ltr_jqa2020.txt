I have attended Town meeting, Sir, and it was upon the 
occasion of the choice of representative for the district. I 
was indeed not a little diverted at the scene, and derived 
I believe some little instruction as well as entertainment 
from it. Three-fourths of the votes in this town were indeed for Mr. Ames, and this perhaps may enable you to 
form an opinion respecting the popularity of the general 
government in this State. Mr. Gerry too is reelected in 
the district of Middlesex, notwithstanding the whole personal interest of Mr. Gorham and his friends was very 
strenuously exerted to operate a change. There was not even the pretence of opposing a candidate to Mr. Goodhue, 
and Mr. Sedgwick is also rechosen by a surprising majority of votes in his district. These are premises from 
which much more accurate conclusions may be drawn than from the senseless bawlings of a miserable faction, and who 
are reduced to the last resource of making up in unheeded clamor, their total deficiency of influence and power. The 
real fact is that the new government is very rapidly acquiring a broad and solid foundation of popularity. It possesses 
in my opinion the confidence of the people in this State to a more eminent degree than any other government upon 
earth can boast of, and it appears to me to have already acquired a stability as astonishing as the revolution it has 
produced in the face of our affairs. 
</p><p>
The effects of that revolution are already felt in a very 
high degree in this part of the country. Our commerce is 
increasing and extending ; our manufactures multiplying 
very rapidly, our agriculture flourishing; industry has 
resumed the place which it had resigned for some time to 
idleness and luxury, and is seldom without employ. I am 
informed that the mechanics of almost every description 
in this town are at present more constantly busy than they 
have been at any period since the Revolution. The population of the town has increased from 14,000 to 18,000 in 
habitants since the year <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1784">1784</a>, and the property has augmented in a much greater proportion. Twelve hundred 
people are employed by one manufacture which has been 
only three or four years established; that of wool cards. 
</p><p>
That of sail cloth, equally recent, gives bread to several 
hundred more. Paper hangings have become even an 
article of exportation from hence. Near four hundred tons 
of hemp I hear have been raised this season, within the 
state. This is a new article of cultivation, and even so 
late as the last year there were not more than thirty tons 
raised within the Commonwealth. It is found to be a 
very profitable article, and in all probability in the course 
of two or three years will cease to be imported altogether; 
and from a calculation which I have seen we might export 
it and easily undersell the Russians. There is a Colonel 
Wood in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charlestown</a> who has raised more than three tons 
upon six acres of his land, and the produce of that small 
field will neat him 300 dollars. There is undoubtedly a 
connecting chain, the commune vinculum, between all the 
various employments of mankind as well as between the 
liberal arts and sciences. The farmer, the tradesman, the 
mechanic and the merchant, are all mutually so dependent 
upon one another for their prosperity, that I really know 
not whether most to pity the ignorance or to lament the 
absurdity of the partial politicians, who are constantly 
erecting an imaginary wall of separation between them. 
</p><p>
The health of the Governor has been better for these 
two months than for several years before. There is I think 
a probability that he will hold the chair of state for many 
years to come. It will not I presume be contested him; 
and indeed the bitterness of parties has been tempered very 
much by the favorable alteration in the public affairs. 
The public peace and public prosperity appear in this in 
stance to have possessed a mutual acting and reacting 
power to establish and confirm each other. . . . 
</p><p>
In the stagnation of our own politics the people who have a fondness for the subject turn their attention to 
those of Europe, which seems to be now as much as ever 
it could be un repaire d horreurs. The war between Spain 
and England has been so long suspended in the balance, 
that we presume one of the scales must very soon preponderate. The last information we have has a greater appearance of hostility than any we. have hitherto received. In 
France it appears to me the National Assembly in tearing 
the lace from the garb of government, will tear the coat 
itself into a thousand rags. That nation may for ought I 
know finally be free, but I am firmly persuaded it will not be 
until they have undergone another revolution. A nobility 
and a clergy, church and state levelled to the ground in one 
year's time ; rights not inconsistent with those of man, established by a prescription uncontrovertible, if any prescription 
can be so ; rights like these blown to the winds by the single 
breath of a triumphant democracy, are inauspicious omens 
for the erection of an equitable government of laws. By 
the politeness of the French consul I have perused several 
volumes of their debates and projects for constitutions. 
There are some valuable papers among them ; but it appears 
to me that the rabble that followed on the heels of Jack Cade 
could not have devised greater absurdities than many of 
their propositions ; some of which have been adopted by the 
Assembly. I am, dear Sir, yours affectionately,
