Sir, 
</p><p>
Yesterday afternoon I was arrested in the street, and conducted to the Section de la Butte des Moulins, because I had 
not a Carte de Citoyen. Fortunately a person who knew me, having heard what had passed, came to my rescue, and brought me out of the affair, on his own responsibility. I have 
the honor to send you, herewith, the copy of the pass given me by the Section. I beg, Sir, that you will have the goodness to secure me against similar accidents, troublesome in 
themselves, and scandalous from their publicity. 
</p><p>
I pray you, also, to grant me protection from domiciliary visits. Armed men came into my house yesterday, and although I had every reason to be satisfied with their conduct, (for they 
went away as soon as I convinced them of the impropriety of their proceedings,) yet I think that when general orders are 
given for these visits, such houses ought to be excepted as are under the protection of the Law of Nations. 
</p><p>
Will you do me the favor also to send me a passport for travelling into the interior ? In the month of January it happened to me to be arrested and sent back to Paris, under pretence 
that the passport you gave me was out of date. I am in expectation of going forthwith to pass a few days at my country house, and it may be that I shall be again stopped. 
</p><p>
Will you have the goodness, Sir, to sign the enclosed certificates for the members of my family ? I have the honor 
to be, &c. 
</p><p>
