<a rel='month origin' value='1'>January</a> <a rel='day origin' value='14'>14th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. Yesterday I broke down gave way to abject terror under the news of <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman's</a> advance with no 
news of my husband. To-day, while wrapped up on the sofa, too dismal even for moaning, there was a loud knock. 
Shawls on and all, just as I was, I rushed to the door to find 
a telegram from my husband : "All well ; be at home Tuesday." It was dated from Adam's Run. I felt as lighthearted as if the war were over. Then I looked at the date and the place Adam's Run. It ends as it began in a run 
Bull's Run, from which their first sprightly running astounded the world, and now Adam's Run. But if we must 
run, who are left to run? From Bull Run they ran fullhanded. But we have fought until maimed soldiers, women, 
and children are all that remain to run.

To-day Kershaw's brigade, or what is left of it, passed through. What shouts greeted it and what bold shouts of 
thanks it returned ! It was all a very encouraging noise, absolutely comforting. Some true men are left, after all.
