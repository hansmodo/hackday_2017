DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I wrote to you the other day, in a great hurry, by express, 
sending a letter for <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> from <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a>. 
I have this morning had another express from <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a>, 
acquainting me he has crossed the river to the <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a> side ; 
that he had been near surprising the town ; that it was closely 
invested ; that they were in the greatest confusion within, the 
inhabitants having refused to take arms. A scarcity of provisions and wood must bring the garrison to terms, were a blockade alone to be the measure adopted. Mr. Carleton is in statuquo, about fifteen miles on this side of Sorel, where I hope 
they will not let him pass. I suppose Mr. Carleton is on board 
the fleet, which left this upon my arrival; as I have never 
had any account of his making his escape. I have not yet 
been able to adjust the new-formed corps, or get our warm 
clothing ready to go down, touching which I am exceedingly 
impatient, Arnold having no artillery, and being in want of warm clothing. 
</p><p>
I have appointed a Mr. Mason, one of our friends in this town, postmaster, till the pleasure of Congress be known. 
</p><p>
I find Mr. Price so active and intelligent, so warm a friend to the measures adopted by Congress, that I wish to have him 
mentioned in the strongest terms to Congress. 
</p><p>
I have set a regiment on foot of Canadians, James Livings 
ton, Colonel, to be engaged twelve months, should this unhappy 
controversy last so long. 
</p><p>
I have made the inhabitants acquainted with the views of 
Congress relative to this province, declaring I should call a 
Convention on my return from <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a>. I have had some conversation with Pere Flacquet, a Jesuit at the head of the society 
here, and esteemed a very sensible fellow; he complained of 
some little indignities shown their order, particularly in making 
part of their house the common prison by his Majesty's Governors. I promised redress, and hinted, at the same time, the 
great probability of that society enjoying their estate (notwithstanding Sir Jeffery Amherst's pretensions), should this province 
accede to the General Union. 
</p><p>
I hope this hint may be of service ; the priests hitherto having  done us all the mischief in their power in many parishes. 
They will not yet give the people absolution. However, I have 
shown all the respect in my power to religion, and have winked 
at this behaviour in the priests, for fear of giving malice a 
handle. 
</p><p>
I wish I could have apprised you, in time, of your obligation. to Captain McKay. He generously offered Mr. Carleton, 
if he would give him two hundred men, to go and burn the 
new church at <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a> last summer. He is so inveterate a 
fellow that I think, if the other prisoners should be indulged 
in returning to their families this winter, he ought not to be 
permitted to enter this province. "When a Convention is assembled, I propose requesting the return of the other gentlemen, 
on their parole. The inhabitants are our friends on both sides 
of the river to <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a>; our expresses go without interruption 
backwards and forwards ; a young man who is got out of <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, informs me, that the Lieutenant-Governor, the Chief Justice, 
and several others, have put their baggage on board ship, and 
that no ship is permitted to sail ; this looks as if they despaired of making a defence. Colonel McLean has threatened a 
[sally,] and Arnold is apprised of it, and his troops wish for it. 
</p><p>
I hear there is a considerable quantity of powder at Niagara ; 
perhaps this may be thought an object worthy of attention; they have been very apprehensive of an attack from the Virginians in that quarter all this summer. 
</p><p>
I fear Carleton has thrown a great quantity of powder into the river. I have desired a severe message to be delivered to him on that subject. 
</p><p>
Farewell, my dear Sir, and believe me, with all regard and respect, Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

P. S. Hard money should be sent down. I can get some thousands here from Price, though not sufficient to answer all expenses, and it is too soon to offer paper.
