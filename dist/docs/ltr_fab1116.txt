I am entirely out of business for the first time here. I have been settling up all last month and got through Friday.

I have not seen Captain Phillips but I think of going a voyage with him in the Schooner Columbia. I want to do something until next Spring, enough to make my expenses and then I think of giving the mines a fair trial for
six months. I believe there is just as good a chance to make money in the mines now and for another year to come, as ever has been in times past, whereas trade is very uncertain. Mining is a sure thing. You get your pay in gold every night. It is a hard life but I can stand it for one year at least. Sewall has dug this season from $1000 to $1500 and in running around and in various ways has spent it all. He has been at work in a poor place, not averaging over five dollars per day the greater part of the time. I hope he will do better this winter. We have all come to the conclusion to go to mining next summer but the 'white man is very uncertain,' you know, and by next spring we may conclude to go into something else.

I think very favorable of farming and have bought five hens of Kirk, brought out by Stover. With these and the horses and cattle that we have at the ranch, I could make a start and, I have no doubt, make money. I will inform you if I go a voyage. I hope to go either to the Sandwich or Society Islands after vegetables and hogs. This would be a delightful excursion. Only think of revelling amid those orange groves in January!
