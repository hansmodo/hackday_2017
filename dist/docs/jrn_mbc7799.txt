<a rel='month origin' value='6'>June</a> <a rel='day origin' value='27'>27th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=camden' rel='city origin'>CAMDEN</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. An awful story from Suniter. An old gentleman, who thought his son dead or in a Yankee prison, 
heard some one try the front door. It was about midnight, and these are squally times. He called out, " What is 
that? " There came no answer. After a while he heard some one trying to open a window and he fired. The house 
was shaken by a fall. Then, after a long time of dead silence, he went round the house to see if his shot had done 
any harm, and found his only son bathed in his own blood on his father's door-step. The son was just back from a 
Yankee prison one of his companions said and had been made deaf by cold and exposure. He did not hear his 
father hail him. He had tried to get into the house in the same old way he used to employ when a boy.

My sister-in-law in tears of rage and despair, her servants all gone to " a big meeting at Mulberry/ though 
she had made every appeal against their going. " Send them adrift," some one said, " they do not obey you, or 
serve you; they only live on you." It would break her heart to part with one of them. But that sort of thing 
will soon right itself. They will go off to better themselves we have only to cease paying wages and that is easy, for we have no money.
