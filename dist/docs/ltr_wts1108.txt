Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
I have watched the despatches, which are up to Dec. 10, 
and hoped your election would occur without the usual 
excitement, and believe such w r ould have been the case 
had it not been for your signing for that Helper's Book. 
Of it I know nothing, but extracts made copiously in 
Southern papers show it to be not only abolition but 
assailing. Now I hoped you would be theoretical and 
not practical, for practical abolition is disunion, civil war, 
and anarchy universal on this continent, and I do not 
believe you want that. ... I do hope the discussion in 
Congress will not be protracted, and that your election, if 
possible, will occur soon. Write me how you came to 
sign for that book. Now that you are in, I hope you will 
conduct yourself manfully. Bear with taunts as far as 
possible, biding your time to retaliate. An opportunity 
always occurs. 
</p><p>
Your affectionate brother,
