<a rel='month origin' value='5'>May</a> <a rel='day origin' value='4'>4th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=camden' rel='city origin'>CAMDEN</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. Home again at Bloomsbury. From Chester to Winnsboro we did not see one living thing, man, woman, 
or animal, except poor William trudging home after his sad disaster. The blooming of the gardens had a funereal effect. 
Nature is so luxuriant here, she soon covers the ravages of savages. No frost has occurred since the seventh of March, 
which accounts for the wonderful advance in vegetation. This seems providential to these starving people. In this 
climate so much that is edible can be grown in two months. 
</p><p>
At Winnsboro we stayed at Mr. Robertson's. There we left the wagon train. Only Mr. Brisbane, one of the general's couriers, came with us on escort duty. The Robertsons 
were very kind and hospitable, brimful of Yankee anecdotes. To my amazement the young people of Winnsboro 
had a May-day celebration amid the smoking ruins. Irrepressible is youth. 
</p><p>
The fidelity of the negroes is the principal topic. There seems to be not a single case of a negro who betrayed his 
master, and yet they showed a natural and exultant joy at being free. After we left Winnsboro negroes were seen in 
the fields plowing and hoeing corn, just as in antebellum times. The fields in that respect looked quite cheerful. We 
did not pass in the line of <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman's</a> savages, and so saw 
some houses standing.

Mary Kirkland has had experience with the Yankees. She has been pronounced the most beautiful woman on this 
side of the Atlantic, and has been spoiled accordingly in all society. When the Yankees came, Monroe, their negro man 
servant, told her to stand up and hold two of her children in her arms, with the other two pressed as close against her 
knees as they could get. Mammy Selina and Lizzie then stood grimly on each side of their young missis and her 
children. For four mortal hours the soldiers surged through the rooms of the house. Sometimes Mary and her 
children were roughly jostled against the wall, but Mammy and Lizzie were stanch supporters. The Yankee soldiers 
taunted the negro women for their foolishness in standing by their cruel slave-owners, and taunted Mary with being 
glad of the protection of her poor ill-used slaves. Monroe 
meanwhile had one leg bandaged and pretended to be lame, so that he might not be enlisted as a soldier, and kept making pathetic appeals to Mary.

"Don't answer them back, Miss Mary, said he. Let em say what dey want to ; don't answer em back. Don't 
give em any chance to say you are impudent to em. 
</p><p>
One man said to her : "Why do you shrink from us and avoid us so ? We did not come here to fight for negroes ; we 
hate them. At Port Royal I saw a beautiful white woman driving in a wagon with a coal-black negro man. If she had 
been anything to me I would have shot her through the heart." " Oh, oh! " said Lizzie, " that's the way you talk 
in here. I'll remember that when you begin outside to beg me to run away with you. 
</p><p>
Finally poor Aunt Betsy, Mary's mother, fainted from pure fright and exhaustion. Mary put down her baby and 
sprang to her mother, who was lying limp in a chair, and fiercely called out, " Leave this room, you wretches! Do 
you mean to kill my mother ? She is ill ; I must put her to bed. Without a word they all slunk out ashamed. If I 
had only tried that hours ago, she now said. Outside they remarked that she was "an insolent rebel huzzy, who thinks 
herself too good to speak to a soldier of the United States", and one of them said "Let us go in and break her mouth." 
But the better ones held the more outrageous back. Monroe slipped in again and said: " Missy, for God's sake, when 
dey come in be sociable with em. Dey will kill you." 
</p><p>
" Then let me die." 
</p><p>
The negro soldiers were far worse than the white ones.

Mrs. Bartow drove with me to Mulberry. On one side of the house we found every window had been broken, 
every bell torn down, every piece of furniture destroyed, and every door smashed in. But the other side was intact. 
Maria Whitaker and her mother, who had been left in charge, explained this odd state of things. The Yankees 
were busy as beavers, working like regular carpenters, destroying everything when their general came in and stopped 
them. He told them it was a sin to destroy a fine old house like that, whose owner was over ninety years old. He would 
not have had it done for the world. It was wanton mischief. 
He explained to Maria that soldiers at such times were excited, wild, and unruly. They carried off sacks full of our 
books, since unfortunately they found a pile of empty sacks in the garret. Our books, our letters, our papers were after 
ward strewn along the Charleston road. Somebody found things of ours as far away as Vance's Ferry.

This was Potter's raid. <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> took only our horses. Potter's raid came after <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Johnston's</a> surrender, and ruined 
us finally, burning our mills and gins and a hundred bales of cotton. Indeed, nothing is left to us now but the bare 
land, and the debts contracted for the support of hundreds of negroes during the war. 
</p><p>
J. H. Boykin was at home at the time to look after his own interests, and he, with John de Saussure, has saved 
the cotton on their estates, with the mules and farming utensils and plenty of cotton as capital to begin on again. The 
negroes would be a good riddance. A hired man would be a good deal cheaper than a man whose father and mother, 
wife and twelve children have to be fed, clothed, housed, and nursed, their taxes paid, and their doctor's bills, all 
for his half-done, slovenly, lazy work. For years we have thought negroes a nuisance that did not pay. They pretend 
exuberant loyalty to us now. Only one man of Mr. Chesnut's left the plantation with the Yankees. 
</p><p>
When the Yankees found the Western troops were not at Camden, but down below Swift Creek, like sensible folk 
they came up the other way, and while we waited at Chester for marching orders we were quickly ruined after the surrender. With our cotton saved, and cotton at a dollar a pound, we might be in comparatively easy circumstances. 
But now it is the devil to pay, and no pitch hot. Well, all this was to be.

Godard Bailey, editor, whose prejudices are all against 
us, described the raids to me in this wise : They were regularly organized. First came squads who demanded arms 
and whisky. Then came the rascals who hunted for silver, ransacked the ladies wardrobes and scared women and 
children into fits at least those who could be scared. Some of these women could not be scared. Then came 
some smiling, suave, well-dressed officers, who " regretted it all so much." Outside the gate officers, men, and bummers divided even, share and share alike, the piles of plunder. 
</p><p>
When we crossed the river coming home, the ferry man at Chesnut's Ferry asked for his fee. Among us all we 
could not muster the small silver coin he demanded. There was poverty for you. Nor did a stiver appear among us 
until Molly was hauled home from Columbia, where she was waging war with Sheriff Dent's family. As soon as her foot 
touched her native heath, she sent to hunt up the cattle. Many of our cows were found in the swamp ; like Marion's 
men they had escaped the enemy. Molly sells butter for us now on shares.

Old Cuffey, head gardener at Mulberry, and Yellow Abram, his assistant, have gone on in the even tenor of their 
way. Men may come and men may go, but they dig on for ever. And they say they mean to " as long as old master 
is alive." We have green peas, asparagus, lettuce, spinach, new potatoes, and strawberries in abundance enough for 
ourselves and plenty to give away to refugees. It is early in May and yet two months since frost. Surely the wind 
was tempered to the shorn lamb in our case.

Johnny went over to see Hampton. His cavalry are ordered to reassemble on the 20th a little farce to let them 
selves down easily ; they know it is all over. Johnny, smiling serenely, said, "The thing is up and forever." 
</p><p>
Godard Bailey has presence of mind. Anne Sabb left a gold card-case, which was a terrible oversight, among the 
cards on the drawing-room table. When the Yankee raiders saw it their eyes glistened. Godard whispered to her : 
"Let them have that gilt thing and slip away and hide the silver. " No ! " shouted a Yank, " you don't fool me 
that way ; here's your old brass thing ; don't you stir ; fork over that silver. And so they deposited the gold card-case 
in Godard's hands, and stole plated spoons and forks, which had been left out because they were plated. Mrs. Beach 
says two officers slept at her house. Each had a pillow-case crammed with silver and jewelry " spoils of war," they called it.

Floride Cantey heard an old negro say to his master: When you all had de power you was good to me, and I'll 
protect you now. No niggers nor Yankees shall tech you. 
If you want anything call for Sambo. I mean, call for Mr. Samuel ; dat my name now.
