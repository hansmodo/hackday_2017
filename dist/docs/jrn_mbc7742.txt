<a rel='month origin' value='9'>September</a> <a rel='day origin' value='24'>24th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. These stories of our defeats in the valley fall like blows upon a dead body. Since Atlanta fell I 
have felt as if all were dead within me forever. Captain Ogden, of General Chesnut's staff, dined here to-day. Had 
ever brigadier, with little or no brigade, so magnificent a staff? The reserves, as somebody said, have been secured 
only by robbing the cradle and the grave the men too old, the boys too young. Isaac Hayne, Edward Barnwell, 
Bacon, Ogden, Richardson, Miles are the picked men of the agreeable world.
