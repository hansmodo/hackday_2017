MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
LAST night we all arrived in this place from <a href='/results.php?city=ferrol' rel='city'>Ferrol</a>. 
The distance is about twenty miles by land, over high 
mountains and bad roads. You would have been diverted to have seen us all mounted upon our mules 
and marching in train. From the mountains we had 
all along the prospect of a rich, fertile country, cultivated up to the tops of the highest hills and down to 
the very edge of water, all along the shore. 
</p><p>
I made my visit last night to the governor of the 
province, who resides here, and to the governor of 
the town, and was politely received by both. I have 
a long journey before me of a thousand miles, I sup 
pose, at least, to Paris. Through this kingdom we 
shall have bad roads and worse accommodations. I 
don t expect to be able to get to Paris in less than 
thirty days. I shall have an opportunity of seeing 
Spain, but it will be at a great expense. I am advised 
by every body to go by land. The frigate, the Sensible, is in so bad condition as to make it probable 
she will not be fit to put to sea in less than three or 
four weeks, perhaps five or six ; and then we should 
have the storms and enemies of the Bay of Biscay to 
escape or encounter. After this wandering way of 
life is passed, I hope to return to my best friend and 
pass the remainder of our days in quiet. 
</p><p>
I cannot learn that Great Britain is yet in temper 
to listen to propositions of peace, and I don t expect 
before another winter to have much to do in my present capacity. My tenderest affection to our dear 
children, and believe me 
</p><p>
Ever yours.
