Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding my repeated and earnest applications to the Count de Florida Blanca, I have as yet been able to 
obtain only $34,880 of the 8150,000 expressly promised 
me in December last. He has, on the contrary, assured 
me that this promise cannot be complied with in less than 
six months. It therefore became necessary to communicate my embarrassments to the ambassador of France, and 
to request his friendly aid and interposition. You will perceive, by the enclosed account, that the bills I have accepted 
and what still remain to be paid (exclusive of those at two 
months' sight, for the payment of which you authorized me 
to draw upon you) amount to $231,303; of which 
$89,083 will be payable this month,

The ambassador was very sensible of the pernicious 
consequences which would follow a protest of these bills, 
and, I must do him the justice to say, interested himself 
warmly in endeavouring to extricate me from that necessity. 
He has had different conferences with the Count D. F. B. on 
the subject, and yesterday he promised the ambassador positively to pay the $89,083 which will be due in April, in the 
course of six months, in six equal payments, reckoning 
from next May ; but as this money still left me without 
relief as to the April bill, he engaged the Marquis d'Yranda 
to advance the sums necessary to pay them, and which I 
shall accordingly receive from him. Thus, my dear sir. I 
have been, as it were, reprieved by the kind offices of the 
French ambassador, from protesting any of the bills due 
this month ; but every ensuing month will bring with it new 
dangers and solicitudes, and particularly the month of May, 
in the course of which I shall be called upon for no less 
than 896,288. I am in a cruel situation, and without the 
least expectation of succour except from France. I therefore think it necessary to inform you of the delicate state 
of our affairs here by express, and to entreat you to use 
your utmost endeavours to provide me, by his return, with 
funds adequate to the bills accepted, and wdiich at present 
amount to $142,220, without including either those which 
may yet arrive, or the $89,083 due this month, and for the 
payment of which I expect to reimburse the Marquis 
d'Yranda with the money promised by the minister in the 
monthly payment before mentioned. 
</p><p>
The Marquis d'Yranda, whom I saw yesterday at the 
French ambassador's, has further agreed, at the ambassador's request, to furnish me with the further sum of $142,220 
as I shall have occasion for it, provided Mr. Grand will 
accept his drafts to that amount. It is therefore of the last 
importance that arrangements for this purpose be immediately taken with that gentleman, and that I receive, by 
the return of the express, his order on the marquis to furnish me at least with the sum of <a href='/results.php?year=8142'>8142</a>,220 ; without which 
it will be impossible for me to pay these bills. 
</p><p>
The ambassador will also write by this courier, and I 
have little doubt but that your court will generously interpose on this, as they have on several other occasions, to 
prevent events prejudicial to America in particular, and the 
common cause in general. I am also constrained to add, 
that our situation here is daily becoming more disagreeable 
from the want of our salaries. To be obliged to contract 
debts and live on credit is terrible. I have not, to this day, 
received a shilling from America ; and we should indeed 
have been greatly distressed, had it not been for your good 
offices. Endeavour, I beseech you, to provide us with supplies on this account, and deliver me, if possible, from the 
many disagreeable sensations which such a variety of unpleasant circumstances naturally creates. Remember that 
new bills are still arriving. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to communicate this letter to Mr. Laurens, 
who, I am persuaded, will cheerfully afford you all the aid 
in his power. 
</p><p>
I have directed the courier to wait your orders, and then 
return without further delay. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your friend and humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>. 
</p><p>
P.S. You will perceive, from the enclosed account, that 
I shall be under the necessity of drawing upon you for ten 
or twelve thousand dollars, on account of the twenty-five 
thousand, before it will be possible to hear from you on the 
subject.
