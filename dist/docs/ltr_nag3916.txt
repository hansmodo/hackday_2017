DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I have received your letter by Mr. Pollock, with the returns enclosed. 
Intelligence from town induces me to believe the enemy are making 
preparations for another expedition after provision, and that the neighborhood of <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> will be their object, if there is a large quantity 
of provisions near that place. I beg that some steps may be taken for 
removing the rice, if possible, or for effectually covering the country 
from the ravages of the enemy. I am unable, at this distance, to deter 
mine with precision the position you ought to take, or the measures 
you have it in your power to pursue, to oppose their designs. You 
will, therefore, adopt the plan which you think most eligible. 
I am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
