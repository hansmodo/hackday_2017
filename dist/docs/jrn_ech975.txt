Early this morning the dog belonging to Mr. Devine was taken with a fit as if mad, and this being observed by Mrs. Devine, she seized her by the throat and threw her overboard.

It is now just one month since we left Philadelphia and we are not yet 2,000 miles from there. If we do not progress faster hereafter it will take us about eight months to reach San Francisco. We are now getting into the Trade Winds, latitude 28 deg. and longitude 39 deg., and hope to make much better progress. The Captain tells us we will see no more seaweed, which has been very abundant, until we get in latitude 18 deg. S. We expect to cross the Equator in about two weeks. The weather has been remarkably cool and pleasant, nothing like as oppressively hot as July and August usually are
in Philadelphia. Today has been the warmest since we left port. Two dolphins were caught today. We had them for supper. Several chickens escaped overboard towards evening and the boat was lowered to take them up. A vessel was discovered in the distance bearing direct for us and many set to work posting up their letters, but were disappointed in having an opportunity to send them, for the vessel soon changed her course and we lost sight of her.

I have repacked my trunk and placed camphor in all the woolen clothing, and have done my first mending. I flatter myself it was as well done as any "knight of the Goose" could have done it. We pared our onions and put them in a barrel to pickle.

About half a dozen of our passengers appear to be inveterate rum drinkers. Last night they raised a fuss among themselves and annoyed all well-disposed persons by their boisterous conduct. This morning one of them made his appearance decorated with a black eye. He fell out of his hammock. It is highly probable that these worthies will be placed on shore at the first port we stop unless they mend their ways. They have been intoxicated nearly half of the time since leaving port.

Another week on the Atlantic is ending and here we might pause and with wisdom reflect on the future. Our greatest pleasure now would be once more to place our feet on beloved terra firma. How pleasantly would an hour pass in the society of loved ones left behind. At home the end of the week was always most welcome as it was followed by a day of rest and sweet pleasure. But here every day may be said to be alike, a continual rolling about, and land would be the most welcome thing I can imagine. The passengers and sailors are having a sociable dance while I am writing.
