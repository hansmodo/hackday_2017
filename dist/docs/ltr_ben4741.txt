SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your favour of the 20th of April with the very 
entertaining and informing Books you so obligingly sent me, 
for which I thank you. 
</p><p>
As you seem only to have seen Extracts in the Magazines 
from the Account of East Florida, I send you the Book itself, 
which may afford you some farther Lights concerning the 
Country. I am not myself otherwise much acquainted with 
it than from such public Writings, my Place of Abode, 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, being near <a href='/results.php?year=1000'>1000</a> Miles from Florida. I can 
only remark to you that generally those who have at heart 
the Settlement of New Countries, are apt, while they expatiate 
on the Advantages, to pass over and conceal the Disadvantages, so that a just Idea of the New Country is rarely to be 
obtained by reading their Accounts. And as you profess a 
Reliance on my Opinion in the Affair of your removal to 
America, I must not advise you to go to E. Florida, lest 
my Unacquaintedness with that Country should lead you into hazardous Mistakes. Besides, when I consider the Hardships usually attending the Settlement of New Countries, and the Sickness and Mortality to which new Settlers, 
unaccustomed to the Climate, are exposed, I cannot think 
such Undertakings so fit for Persons of your & your Wife's 
Age, that have Children depending on them, as for young 
unmarried Persons, whose Deaths can only affect themselves, 
or will not be attended with such unhappy Consequences. 
Therefore, if you cannot remain contented with your Situation in Holland, but are determined on a Country Life in 
America, my Advice to you would be, to purchase a Plantation ready formed, in one of the old Settled Provinces, New 
York, New Jersey, or Pensilvania, of which there are 
Choice continually to be sold, as you will see by the Newspapers that I send you herewith. In either of these three 
Provinces the three modern Languages you possess, German, 
Low Dutch & French, may be useful to you, as there are 
Numbers of Germans, Hollanders and French among the 
Inhabitants ; and your other Accomplishments will be of 
more Value in a well-settled Country, than in a new One 
thin of People, and you will have more of the Pleasures and 
Comforts of Neighbourhood & Society. With the money 
you are like to be possessed of, at the End of your present 
Contract you may certainly buy and Stock a very good 
Plantation in one of those flourishing Provinces, where the 
Climate is healthy, and the Government mild and good, 
and where if anywhere, Competence and Happiness are 
within the Reach of every honest, prudent & industrious 
Man. 
</p><p>
I purpose remaining here another Winter, and returning 
home to Pensilvania in the Spring. I hope your Resolution, 
whatever it is, may be attended with the Success you wish. 
If you determine for either of those Provinces, as I live in 
one of them, my Son in another (N. Jersey) and I have some 
Friends in the third, N. York, I may possibly be of some 
utility to you in your Settling, which would be a Pleasure to, 
Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient humble Servant

B. FRANKLIN.
