<p>
TO JAMES MADISON, ESQ. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">PHILADELPHIA</a>, February 13, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1791">1791</a>. 
</p><p>
HONORED SIR, I have received yours of the 31 ult, and am 
glad to find that my sister Hite has withdrawn herself from the 
region of the small-pox. It gives me particular pleasure, also, 
to learn that my mother's health has been so far restored. 
</p><p>
You will see by one of the enclosed papers that the price of 
wheat continues at from 8s. 4d. to 8s. Gd. Whether it will rise 
or fall, or how much, is more than I can say. I think the 
chances will justify your refusal of the Virginia prices at least. 
</p><p>
I do not see what better you can do with your certificates 
than to subscribe them to the public fund at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a>. Those 
from North Carolina are to be liquidated and subscribed here. 
You had best send them by Mr. Hite in the spring. I received 
Mr. Webb's papers from Col. Monroe, and laid them before the 
House of Representatives, with a petition, which has been referred to the secretary of the Treasury. The crowd of such 
business which had been previously referred to him makes it 
pretty certain that no report can be made to the present session. Let Mr. W. know this, if you please, and save me the 
trouble of writing to him. 
</p><p>
The Excise Bill has not yet got through the Senate, where it 
is undergoing sundry alterations, but none that will materially 
affect it. The optional clause, permitting the owners of stills 
to pay either the tax on the size of the stills, or on the quantity 
actually distilled, will pretty certainly remain a part of the Bill, and as an answer to the most popular objection to it. The 
Bill for incorporating a Bank has passed the two Houses by large 
majorities, and is before the President. It was opposed in both 
as being unconstitutional, as well as in other respects objectionable. 
</p><p>
The arguments against it are extremely mutilated, and even 
perverted in the newspapers, but the sketch will give some idea 
of the turn of them. 
</p><p>
The Bill for admitting Kentucky has become a law. Vermont is applying for the same privilege, and will be also gratified. 
</p><p>
The subject immediately before the House of Representatives 
is the Bill for selling the Western Lands. It has made some 
progress, and I hope will get through. The other important 
Bills are in some danger of failing at the present session, which 
will end on the 4th of March. 
</p><p>
I remain, your affectionate and dutiful son. 
</p><p>
The earthquake was not felt here at all. The winter has 
been very dry, and, with intervals of mild spells, very cold. I 
am not informed of its effects on the winter grain, but suspect 
it must have been unfavorable. 
</p><p>
Substance of a conversation held by James Madison, J r ., with Col. 
Beckwith, at the desire of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="friend colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a>, Secretary of State. 
</p><p>
Last evening offered the first opportunity of breaking to Col. 
B. the subject for which he has been thought a proper channel 
to the Governor of Canada. It was explicitly made known to 
him, that besides its being generally understood that the N. W. 
Indians were supplied with the means of war from their intercourse with Detroit, &c., the president had received information, 
which he considered as certain, that ample supplies of that sort 
had, about the commencement of last campaign, been received 
by the hostile tribes from places at present in British hands. 
It was observ. to him at the same time, that as the United 
States had no other object in the present [Indian] war but to 
effect and establish peace on their frontier, it was obvious in 
what light such a circumstance must be viewed by them. And 
as a further consideration heightening the colour of the fact, he 
was reminded that the Indians in question were, without an exception, inhabitants of the acknowledged territory of the United States, and, consequently, stood in a certain relation to them 
well understood by the nations possessing territories on this 
continent. 
</p><p>
The sum of his answer was, that as a fact so stated, however 
unaccountable it might be, was not to be contradicted, he could 
only undertake to affirm that it was impossible it could have 
proceeded directly or indirectly from the British Government, 
or have had the sanction or countenance of the authority on the 
spot. He multiplied assurances that the whole spirit and policy 
of their Government was opposed to Indian hostilities; and that 
the sentiments, views, and orders of Lord Dorchester discouraged them as much as possible. This he knew to be the case. 
He asked whether there were any particulars of time, place, or 
persons, contained in the information to the President; whether 
there was any evidence that the articles supplied were in greater 
quantities than were usual for other purposes than war; intimating that, if there were just ground of complaint, a regular 
statement and communication of it, in any mode that might be 
thought not improper, would be most correspondent with the 
customary proceedings in such cases. For himself, he should 
be very ready on receiving any such statements or communications to transmit them. He was here, however, not in any 
formal character; on the contrary, in an informal one a very 
informal one, to be sure; and he entered into this conversation 
as between one private gentleman and another. He had, indeed, been a good while at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> before, as well as here, 
[<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,] since the removal of the Government. He 
hoped his stay would be rendered short by the arrival of some 
more authentic character. He was at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> before Mr. 
Jefferson came into the office he now holds, and he believed it 
was known on what footing he was. Yet he had not in any 
respect been turned over to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="friend colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a>, nor had anything 
passed that could give him any pretensions to be in any communication with the Secretary of State. Such a communication was 
no doubt thought improper by the Secretary of State with so 
informal a character, though in a way ever so informal. He did 
not undertake to suppose it was not right; especially as different forms of Governments have different modes of proceedings, 
&c. 
</p><p>
The turn given to the conversation shewing pretty clearly a 
desire to make the occasion subserv.nt to some further and 
direct intercourse with the Government, it was thought proper 
for that reason, as well as for avoiding the necessity of another 
conversation, to reply at once that it was not probable the information received by the President would be made known to 
him in any way more authentic than the present, which it was 
true, as he had observ., was merely a conversation between 
two private gentlemen; but if the fact that the President had 
received the information, as stated, was made sufficiently credible, the proper effect of the communication need not depend on 
the mode of it. If the dispositions of Lord Dorchester were 
such as were described, and of which his reputation for humanity and prudence left no room for doubt, any evidence amounting 
to probability only would ensure all the interference that might 
depend on him. The conduct of Governments towards formal 
and informal characters was certainly not within the compass 
of this conversation. It was probable, however, that no distinction was made by the Government here which was not made 
by all Governments; the difference between those characters 
seeming to lie not in the circumstance of the former being possessed of written and the latter of verbal authority, but in the 
greater publicity and formality of the written credentials produced from the proper source by the former. The evident impropriety of the military supplies afforded to the Indians required, no doubt, that the countenance of the British Government, or even the sanction of the officer on the spot, ought not 
to be presumed as long as the fact could be otherwise explained; 
but as the effect of these aids was the same whether furnished 
by public authority or by vindictive or avaricious individuals, 
it was in every case to be expected that the abuse would be 
corrected; and the circumstance of the Indians in question being 
within the acknowledged limits of the United States, and receiving the means of war against them from a foreign source, 
was again brought into view as heightening the colour of the 
affair. With respect to the particulars of the fact, they did not 
seem to be material. In what degree the President was possessed of them could not be said. It might be difficult to ascertain the particulars, and yet the general fact be sufficiently established. As the Indians at War traded with British subjects 
only, their being able to carry on hostilities was of itself sufficient evidence in the case. It might be difficult, also, to mark 
precisely the line between supplies for war and for hunting; but 
it was probable that not only the difference of quantity demanded, but other indications, must leave little doubt of the 
purpose for which they were intended. 
</p><p>
Col. B. professed the strongest disposition to do anything in 
his power, having been actuated by this disposition in all his 
communications to Canada, but repeated his wish for more 
exact information on the subject. The intelligence was itself 
so vague, and was communicated to him under such reserv. 
that he was really at a loss how to represent it. " May I, Sir, 
mention your name in the case ?" He was answered, that, from 
the nature of the conversation, he would be under no restraint 
from mentioning any circumstance relating to it he pleased. 
" May I, Sir, say that I have your permission to use your 
name ?" Answer. The permission being a part of the conversation, he must be equally free to mention it if he thought fit, 
though it was not perceived to be a circumstance very material. 
" Will you be so good, Sir, as to repeat the information you 
mention to have been received by the President ?" This request 
being complied with, he said he should certainly look out for 
the first opportunity of making the matter known to Lord D., 
and if Mr. M. should be here on the receipt of an answer, he 
should be made acquainted with it, repeating his declaration 
that it was impossible the British Government could in any 
respect have countenanced or approved any supplies to the 
Indians as an aid or encouragement to their hostilities.

JAMES MADISON.
