DEAR SIR, The newspapers will have shewn you the late 
proceedings of the House of Representatives. The present subject of deliberation is the proposed assumption of the State 
debts. Opinions are nearly balanced on it. My own is no 
otherwise favorable to the measure than as it may tend to secure a final settlement and payment of balances among the 
States. An assumption even under such circumstances is liable 
to powerful objections. In the form proposed that object would 
be impeded by the measure, because it interests South Carolina 
and Massachusetts, who are to be chiefly relieved, against such 
a settlement and payment. The immediate operation of the 
plan would be peculiarly hard on Virginia. I think, also, 
that an increase of the federal debt will not only prolong the 
evil, but be further objectionable as augmenting a trust already 
sufficiently great for the virtue and number of the federal Legislature.
