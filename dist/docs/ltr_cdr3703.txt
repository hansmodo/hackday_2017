Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to send to your Excellency a 
letter, which the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague'>Chevalier De La Luzerne</a> begs you would send by the dragoons established on the road 
to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> for carrying on the correspondence. It 
contains a generous offer made by Congress to the King of a seventy-four gun ship. 
</p><p>
The news which I have here of the British fleet, 
are that Admiral Pigot is got into <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> with 
very few ships, himself in a bad state of health, and 
that Admiral Hood, with the greatest part of the 
fleet, has sailed for <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>. If your Excellency has 
the same intelligence confirmed, I beg you would 
send my letter to M. de Vaudreuil. It is, however, 
certain that M. Dumas, Deputy Quartermaster-General, 
has seen yesterday a great part of the fleet under 
sail before the Hook. I expect that I shall arrive, 
with the first division, on the 14th, at Haverstraw. 
The second division will arrive on the loth; and I 
promise to myself a great pleasure in embracing your 
Excellency. I am, with respect and personal attachment. Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and humble servant,
