<span class="date">July 3rd.</span> - Selecting a likely place in the heart of a steep mountain gorge, we transported thither the larger Indian baskets which we had purchased at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jas" rel="contact">Sutter's</a> Fort, and, shovelling the earth into them, passed poles, cut from the nearest pine tree, through the rope-handles we had affixed to these baskets. Resting the poles on our shoulders, we carried the loaded baskets to the brink of the stream, and then set to work after the old fashion, with our hands in the baskets. Our success was great, and the day's return shows a decided improvement upon the Mormon diggings. The soil here is more richly impregnated with gold than below; but the labour of carrying the earth to the water is excessive, and I am so tired this evening that I very reluctantly opened my journal to make this short entry.
