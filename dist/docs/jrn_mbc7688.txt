<a rel='month origin' value='1'>January</a> <a rel='day origin' value='9'>9th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. Met Mrs. Wigfall. She wants me to take Halsey to Mrs. Randolph's theatricals. I am to get him up 
as Sir Walter Raleigh. Now, General Breckinridge has come. I like him better than any of them. Morgan also is 
here. These huge Kentuckians fill the town. Isabella says, 
" They hold Morgan accountable for the loss of Chattanooga. " The follies of the wise, the weaknesses of the 
great ! She shakes her head significantly when I begin to 
tell why I like him so well. Last night General Buckner came for her to go with him and rehearse at the Carys for 
Mrs. Randolph's charades.

The President's man, Jim, that he believed in as we all believe in our own servants, " our own people," as we call 
them, and Betsy, <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis's</a> maid, decamped last night. It is miraculous that they had the fortitude to resist the 
temptation so long. At <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis's</a> the hired servants all have been birds of passage. First they were seen with gold 
galore, and then they would fly to the Yankees, and I am sure they had nothing to tell. It is Yankee money wasted.

I do not think it had ever crossed <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis's</a> brain that these two could leave her. She knew, however, that Betsy 
had eighty dollars in gold and two thousand four hundred dollars in Confederate notes.

Everybody who comes in brings a little bad news not much, in itself, but by cumulative process the effect is depressing, indeed.
