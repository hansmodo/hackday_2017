ARMY OF OPERATIONS

As I have notified Your Excellency in the official communiqué
of today, withdraw the troops through Bejar and Victoria,
I ask Y. E. that you order the Division commanders
that in said retreat, no harm be done
to the property of the inhabitants of
this Country, hoping that this disposition will be
followed precisely.
