Dear Brother: The papers this morning announce 
your election by a strong vote, and settle that question. 
I am of course very glad, for it demonstrates not only 
your strength but that the people of Ohio approve your 
past. As to the future, of course in all things political 
you have far more knowledge than I, but I do believe 
that the extension of the election franchise is being 
pushed beyond the Rule of Right. All beings are entitled to the protection of the law, even " infants not 
born," but because of such natural right it is not to be 
inferred they must vote. To vote implies an understanding almost equivalent to the ability to make laws. 
It is legislative not natural Right. Instead of enlarging the privilege, we must gradually curtail it, in order to 
have stability and security. It was this popular clamor 
for supposed rights that carried the South into rebellion. 
No people were ever more unanimous than they, and 
though now they concede themselves vanquished, yet on 
this and kindred subjects they are as unanimous as ever.

To place or attempt to place the negro on a par with the 
whites will produce new convulsions. The country is 
in no condition to go on with such contests. Better 
pacify or acknowledge conditions than attempt new ones 
dangerous to the peace of the whole country. It will 
take ten years for the South to regain full prosperity 
with the negro free, and that should precede any new 
complication.

Affectionately, etc.,
