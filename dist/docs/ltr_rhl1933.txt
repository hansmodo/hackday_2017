MY DEAR SIR 'Tis a pleasing reflection to one who loves his country, that some few, at least, are to be found, who watch over the public good, and having wisdom to discern with spirit to promote, the general good, 
will not silently suffer encroachments to be made on the rights and liberty, of the community. My long acquaintance with you, my friend, gives me a right to number 
you, among such worthy citizens. It being a common observation, does not lesson the value of it, that a prudent man should lend his assistance to extinguish the 
flames, which had invaded the house of his next door neighbour, and not coldly wait, until the flame had reached his own. History does not more clearly point 
out, any fact than this, that nations which have lapsed from liberty, to a state of slavish subjection, have been brought to this unhappy condition, by gradual paces. 
Great Britain, it seems, having discovered the error of attempting our ruin, by one bold and general stroke, has, at length, fallen on a method of singly attacking 
the colonies, hoping that the others will quietly behold the destruction of one, not immediately and sensibly, connected with the rest. But, though, the billeting act 
is not yet enforced upon us, we are equally with New York in the view of that oppressive measure, far I cannot agree to call it law. An act for suspending the 
legislature of that province, hangs, like a flaming sword, over our heads, and requires, by all means, to be removed. The late duties on paints and glass, though not 
perhaps, literally, a violation of our rights, yet as the connection hetween us and the mother country, renders it necessary that we should, excluding all other nations, 
take manufactures, only from her, in this light, the imposition becomes arbitrary, unjust, and destructive of that mutually beneficial connection, which every good 
subject would wish to see preserved. To obtain redress, sir, on these points, and to inform posterity what were 
our sentiments on them, it seems indispensably necessary, that a dutiful, decent, but firm address, should be 
presented to his majesty, by the Assembly, requesting his royal interposition, for the repeal of these acts. This method, you know, my friend^ is constitutional. The 
subject, when aggrieved, has a right to appeal to the sovereign, for redress; and we have his royal word for it, (in a late speech to Parliament,) that he will equally 
protect the rights of all his people. 
</p><p>
The unhappy wound, which I received in my hand, will not yet permit me to travel, and indeed, I am sorry for it, as it would give me great pleasure to add, on this 
occasion, my poor assistance, to the friends of liberty, contending for their country's rights. 
</p><p>
I am, yours with esteem, &c.
