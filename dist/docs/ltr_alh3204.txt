Mr. Kennedy's House. 
</p><p>
Sm, 
</p><p>
I arrived at this place last night, and, unfortunately, find myself unable to proceed any further. Imagining I had got the better of my complaints, which 
confined me at <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a>'s, and anxious to be about, attending to the march of the troops, the day 
before yesterday I crossed the ferry, in order to fall 
in with General Glover's brigade, which was on its 
march from <a href='/results.php?city=poughkeepsie' rel='city'>Poughkeepsie</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>. I did not. 
however, see it myself, but received a letter from 
Colonel Shepherd, who commands the brigade, in 
forming me he would be, last night, at <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>, and 
this night at King's Ferry. Wagons, &c., are provided on the other side for his accommodation, so 
that there need be no delay, but what is voluntary ; 
and, I believe, Colonel Shepherd is as well disposed 
as could be wished to hasten his march. General 
Poor's brigade crossed the ferry the day before yesterday. Tw 7 o York regiments, Cortlandt's and Livings 
ton's, are with them; they were unwilling to be sepa 
rated from the brigade, and the brigade from them. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a> was unwilling to keep them with 
him, and, if he had consented to do it, the regiments 
to replace them would not join you within six days 
as soon as these. 
</p><p>
The troops now remaining with <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a> 
will amount to about the number you intended, 
though they are not exactly the same. He has detached Colonel Charles Webb's regiment to you. He 
says the troops with him are not in a condition to 
march, being destitute of shoes, stockings, and other 
necessaries ; but, I believe, the true reasons of his 
being unwilling to pursue the mode pointed out by 
you were, his aversion to the York troops, and his 
desire to retain General Parsons with him. I am, 
with much respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Y r our Excellency's most obedient servant,
