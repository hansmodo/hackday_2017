MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS: 
</p><p>
Reports of scouts make it evident that <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel='colleague adversary'>Joe Johnston</a> has removed most of his force from your front, two divisions going to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jml' rel='colleague adversary met'>Longstreet</a>. <a href='/results.php?tla=jml' rel='colleague adversary met'>Longstreet</a> has been reinforced by troops from the East. This makes it evident the enemy intends to secure East 
Tennessee if they can, and I intend to drive them out or get whipped this month. For this purpose you will have to detach 
at least ten thousand men besides Stanley's division (more will be better). I can partly relieve the vacuum at Chattanooga by 
troops from Logan's command. It will not be necessary to take artillery or wagons to Knoxville, but all the serviceable artillery 
horses should be taken to use on artillery there. Six mules to each two hundred men should also be taken, if you have them to 
spare. Let me know how soon you can start.

GRANT, 
</p><p>
Major-General.
