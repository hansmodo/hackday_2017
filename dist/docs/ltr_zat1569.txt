My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your truly welcome & interesting letters of the 25th  ult & I st in 
stant inclosing one from John with several newspapers & a number of 
scraps cut from others, have been received, for which I feel truly grate 
ful It was & always is a source of much real pleasure to hear that 
you were all well at the Barracks, & at Baton Rouge which I truly hope 
will long continue. I truly pleased to hear from John & particularly so 
that he had passed passed his examination with credit, & most truly do I 
hope his course will be marked by industry & prudence in connection 
with perseverance, if so & his life is spared, his cours will I have no 
doubt if not brilliant one, will be highly creditable to himself, his country 
& all deeply interested in him ; his prospects are certainly as flattering as 
they could be expected at this time 
</p><p>
I also rec d a letter from Betty since her return to Baton Rouge 
stating that all was well, her letter was dated on the 3&lt;D th ult. Mrs W m 
Taylor did not stop but continued on home ; she expects to make a visit 
to Virginia the present season, I suppose they have left by this time ; I 
was quite pleas to learn that Puss had gone up with Betty to be put to 
school there, & trust she will beneffit by the arrangement. I expect her 
mother with dumple will soon follow, & where should it prove healthy 
they had all better pass the latter part of the summer & the first of 
autumn, or until it is healthy at the Barracks & there is no danger of 
contageous diseases breaking out there. Mr s Taylor will not leave B. 
Rouge unless it becomes sickly there, in which case she will go to the 
watering places back of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> on the lakes ; perhaps to Pascagoula It was fortunate you did not find the scrape Bob had got into, 
so serious as to make it necessary to remove him to any other school as 
it would not have done to have sent him back to the institution he had 
left in Kentucky ; what to do with him, or where to send him to an institution suited to his age & temper is rather difficult to say ; but you will 
no doubt do what you can to promote his interest & let matters & things 
take their course afterwards 
</p><p>
I am a little surprised that none of the family have heard from Dick 
since he went to the Arkensas Springs, as they as well as myself must 
feel great anxiety respecting him, but hope if he has used the waters 
properly, that he has received great benefit from them, if not that he has 
returned to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> by this, & will at once make trial of the mineral 
springs in Virginia ; for unless his disease is removed very soon, in all 
probability he will be afflicted for life. I observe Finlay has been or 
dered to Jalapa, he has as well remain, or perhaps better where he was 
in the country. Wells has been fortunate in getting to the N. Port 
Barracks, it would have suited you very well, but I imagine it will be 
rather a temporary station for an Army Surgeon ; as soon as this war is 
brought to a close, it will be a place for a hired physician, at least I presume that will be the case. You must be satisfied with your position at 
any rate for the present, you will find it pretty much as I stated it to be 
when you first went there but as the danger from sickness is the greatest 
objection to it. While this war lasts you may always calculate on having 
an overflowing hospital, made up from the sick going & returning to & 
from Mexico ; if they do not bring or leave with you some contageous 
disease it will be the less matter ; but you must get on the best way you 
can hoping for better times & things 
</p><p>
Col Taylor was truly fortunate in getting out in pretty good health, 
& at the time he did, I presume he joined his family some time since. 
Jouett, I fear since his family has left him, will soon get the blues & I 
should not be surprised if he very soon applies for a sick leave if he has 
not already done so 
</p><p>
I had observed a short time since from one of the newspapers which 
reached here an acc c of the flumery played off in devotion real or pre 
tended as regards the forms & ceremonies appertaining to the Catholic 
religion at Puebla & other places which I thought were in bad taste & 
expected they would be animadverted on through the press in stringent 
terms. While I would respect & have it done as far as it was right & 
proper to do so, every religious denomination, Catholic as well as 
Protestant, yet I have a great contempt for hypocricy & deceit of any 
kind, more particular in regard to religious matters ; but the parties con 
cerned have done much in bolstering themselves up & putting others 
down by the aid of deceipt, & misrepresentation. But it seem to me the 
country has been so mislead & mistified in regard to this Mexican war, 
that they hardly know how to act in relation to any transaction which 
may take place in relation or connection with it, no matter how absurd 
or outrageous it may be 
</p><p>
On the subject of the presidency as I stated to you on a former 
occasion I am satisfied if the election was to come off now or during the 
present year, that nothing could prevent my election to that high office ; 
but great changes may & in all probability will take place between now 
& the time for holding the election ; all the influence & power of the 
administration will be brought to bear on me ; & the greatest efforts will 
be made to extol <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a>s achievements beyond anything that has 
occurred in this, or any other age or country ; as I am satisfied he gave 
in his adhesion to the powers that be to pull me down, or himself up 
before he got the authority to strip me of my command, or so large a 
portion of it ; I look on him as hartless & insincere an individual as 
exists. I believe the Union & perhaps a large portion of those filling 
high places at Washington, would prefer seeing Mr Clay elected or in 
fact almost any one else than myself to the office in question ; but it 
seems to that pary will advocate the pretensions of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a>, who by 
very adroit management they may succeed in electing, as very many of 
the Whigs no doubt will vote for him, he having a strong party in 
the great state of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">New York</a> ; the greatest stumbling block in his way, 
will be the bringing Wright forward as the democratic candidate. If I 
was certain that Mr Clay, Judge McLean, J. J. Crittenden, Judge Clay 
ton of Delaware & many others I could name could be elected I would 
at once between ourselves, retire retire from the contest ; but I would 
undergo political martyrdoMrather than see <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> or Cass elected ; 
I would greatly prefer Wright or Vanburen to either of them I have 
not seen the articles referred to by you in the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> paper ; I have 
many ardent friends in that city ; I rec d a letter from Mr Crittenden the 
other day, among other matter saying he had just rec d a letter from the 
honb le R. Johnson of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> one of the senator from Maryland, 
stating that if the election was to take place at this time he believed I 
would get every state in the Union 
</p><p>
I think it very doubtful even if the war continues I will have such 
a force as I ought to justify my making a forward movement, for we 
have on the Rio Grande, & at Saltillo & tremendious sick report, larger 
I apprehend in proportion than it was the last year at this time ; it seems 
to me where ever volunteers go & recruits to unless mixed up or incor 
porated with old soldiers or are embodied, there every disease will be 
known to the human family. Besides I understand from private letters 
rec d here that a battalion called out from Alabama could not be raised 
which was to form part of my com d nor have I heard any thing from the 
Jersey & Maryland Battalions which were to form a portion of my 
forces also ; nor do we know here what progress has or is making to fill 
the ranks of one of the new regt s the 13 which has been assigned to me. 
1 am however making every arrangement for a forward movement, & 
shall advance on San Luis Potosi as soon as all the reenforcement expected reach the country, unless otherwise directed

I feel much solicitude as regards Mrs Taylors health, Betties, Anns 
& the children during what is called the sickly season, but if it becomes un 
healthy at the Barracks the girls & Ann must go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a>, if unhealthy 
there they must go to Pascagoula or some other healthy place on the lake 
</p><p>
I rec d a letter from Col Davis since his arrival at home, he appears 
undetermined what course to pursue as regards accepting the app of 
Bris Gen or not; if the war continues I think he is inclined to accept ; I 
have written advising him to consult his interest & inclination, & to pur 
sue that course which he thinks will be most conductive to his future fame, 
prosperity & happiness. The Col speaks of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> in harsh terms ; 
his duplicity to ward me has been rarely equalled ; but let it all pass 
</p><p>
From newspapers rec d here printed in the City of Mexico, there is 
but little doubt that some communications have taken place between 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a>, then at Puebla, & the Mexican authorities, on the subject of 
negotiations but how far the same was entered into or what will be the 
result is not developed ; but it is something to get the subject before the 
Mexican people & their rulers, & I can but hope for the best Remem 
ber me most affectionately to Ann & the children if any of them are with 
you, if not when you write to them, as well as my regards to Gen Brooke 
& Jouett, & wishing you & yours continued health & prosperity 
</p><p>
I remain Truly 
SURG N R. C. WOOD, and Sincerely your Friend
