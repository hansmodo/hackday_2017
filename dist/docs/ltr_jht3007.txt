SIR, 
</p><p>
Inclosed is account of the charges and expenses 
incurred by providing for Messrs. Penet and De Pliarne, in their journey to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, by your Excellency's direction. I have sent forward to you the bills, 
showing how the account arose. Please to order payment to be made, and sent to me by the post who 
brings this. 
</p><p>
The battalion raising in this Colony, to march to the assistance of our friends at Canada, are enlisted to serve until the 1st of February next, with bounty, 
pay, wages, and allowances, agreeable to resolve of Congress, sent me by the express who last came to you this way. 
</p><p>
Our Treasury was exhausted, and knew not how 
to set the troops forward, until Saturday. intelligence came to me that twelve thousand two hundred 
dollars were received from the Honorable Congress 
for that purpose. My proclamation was out some 
time before, and I hear that men enlist freely, and 
hope they will be on their march soon; have ordered 
them to go off by divisions, and hope nothing will 
retard them. 
</p><p>
Through fear of delay, I wrote, last week, to you 
on the head of our payment of the troops that 
served under you last season ; the pay-rolls are to 
meet your approbation and order for payment ; and 
although provision is received for those going to Canada, yet there remain innumerable calls we are 
unable to answer without further supplies, and apprehend payment is to be made by you on those rolls. 
</p><p>
Three battalions, raised and marching to your camp. 
will come on soon ; three dollars a man was paid, in 
part of wages, to enable them to make necessary 
provisions. I hear that two or three companies are 
gone forward, and the rest going this week. 
</p><p>
I received a letter from Major-General Lee, dated at Stamford, January 31st, wherein he writes; U A most unexpected and severe attack of the rheumatism 
or gout has seized me here, and prevented me personally proceeding. I have sent Colonel Waterbury 
on, as he is sufficiently strong in numbers betwixt his own regiment and the volunteers. I thought 
it prudent to order back Ward's regiment, till they received your Honor's further orders." In another 
scrip, he says ; " There is a late resolve of the Continental Congress, which, had I seen before, would have stopped me. It is, that every detachment of 
the army is to act under the direction of the provincial Congress where it is. What then will be the 
use of a detachment at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ? I answer by 
asking, is <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to be left to be more inimical 
to us than even the Province of Quebec? The policy 
of many there is strained to the utmost against our 
rights. However, I hope better things of their congress, if not perverted by artful threats and craft." 
</p><p>
Since writing thus far, I am. informed that General Lee was carried into <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> in a litter, and 
three members of the Continental Congress are to 
meet him there, to settle measures of conduct. 
</p><p>
I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
