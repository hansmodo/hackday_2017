Dear Henry:
</p><p>
   Yours of the 18th ult. is at hand,
having been forwarded from Somersville, Va; and I will
have to answer it in brief to=night, as we are under
marching orders for to=morrow morning at 3.30, and
I do not know when I shall have an opportunity
of writing again. Our destination is unknown to
your humble servant. I do not know of any regiment
in the service which has been moved about quite as much as
the "Gipsies," as Genl Wise used to call us. --
I am glad to hear that you are having good times
in old Southampton. Do not imagine that the
toils and privations of a soldier's life have made
such a misanthrope of me that hearing of those
good things you describe would cause "hard
thoughts." As far as wishing myself out of the
army is concerned I have wished it long ago,
but shall only get out honorably -- either an honorable
discharge or death.
</p><p>
    Give my "Best" to all the friends and especially remember me to "Katie darling." How I wish
that instead of lying down tonight with my cold
and bony masculine bedfellow, and being bothered
by those parasites which even poor soldiers have, I
could have the pleasure of folding-a -- what
in the D -- l was I going to say? The tattoo
has just commenced to beat, and I must close
as taps will beat in 15 minutes for "lights out".
</p><p>

Your old friend
