Sunnyvale, Calif. <br> Sat. Oct. 12, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1918">1918</a> <br><br> My dear Horace <br> Have been looking for a letter all this week as I could have something to answer 
but I suppose you must be moving forward to the scene of activities as you must 
be by this time well prepared to meet the foe in a battle of your own planning. 
This Friday (unintelligible) 11th. The days slip away so rapidly. Of course in 
our old home-town everyone is getting ready for winter putting (unintelligible) 
storm windows down and starting the furnace but here these are certainly June 
days with a promise of many more the same after the storms and fog. Mrs. Kemble 
just called on a search for faigo. Sent them down to the Spanish people. They 
have lots, likely pretty good as they have lots of waste tomatoes. Mr. Kemble’s 
son Charlie is near you. (unintelligible) remember they live on Monte Ave near 
the blackberry field. The other son is still in England. Jay has been moved 200 
miles back and his P.O. is Bordeaux. Your father has bushled all the corn some 
for seed and some for chickens and to finish the fat on the hogs. Mr. Li is finishing 
picking apples after which he will complete the Thompkins house. Henry and Helen 
are both in School. Father went into Palo Alto with a few apples. They seemed 
to be doing well. Mr. Cook has a brother clerking for him. Clifford is at the 
encampment under training. Things seem to go along about the same. The new school 
house has the tiling all on. He met Oscar had a little visit with him. Father 
has extended the (unintelligible) hog yard so that they can stretch out a little 
better. They certainly are fine now they can be seen. We will get perhaps $50 
for the larger one and will keep the other one for the fat if nothing more. And 
I can easily sell all we do not want. Will wait into Nov. when it is much cooler. 
It is certainly as warm today as any time in the summer. Am looking anxiously 
for a letter today so father has driven out as this is a holiday and the carrier 
of course will not bring it until Monday. I hope you are getting your letters 
better. There are lots on the way. Write often for we are looking all the time.
