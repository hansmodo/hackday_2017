MY DEAR DEVEREUX : Perceiving by the papers that commercial intercourse with Colombia is connived at by 
France, which I have thought it probable may have arisen from the success of your efforts on the part of 
the Republic with the French ministry ; and if I am right in this conjecture, I may rejoice in your having 
been, at least, the proximate cause of that recognition which seems so generally expected to be made by the 
French Government. Should this soon take place, surely the services you have rendered the Republic, and the 
claims you have on Bolivar, can admit of no intervention between you and the Colombian Government, notwithstanding your being a foreigner, to impede your filling any diplomatic situation in Europe you might choose to 
accept under the Republic. Might I, in such an issue of your exciting political speculations, suggest that, if your 
views are not already fixed, I will not say on some more attached, but more competent friend, I would be most 
happy to be appointed your secretary, in which character, I may venture to say, I hope my industry and acquirements would not disappoint your expectations. To this 
application you will 'gratify me with an early answer. But en attendant, if you could, without inconvenience, 
procure me a consular appointment under the Colombian Government, or any agency worth even 200 per annum, 
in any situation in Europe, such an addition to our present small income would make us comfortable any where 
near you; though, I confess, we should receive it with considerable alloy, if it were to depend on the condition of our residing out of Europe.

I have nearly, but not quite, abandoned the project of resuming my profession in Ireland, which is not now the 
happy home of our " by-gone years." The scheme is beset with too many difficulties to promise success, with a detail of which I will not attempt to excite your sympathies. 
</p><p>
Mrs. B. has sanguine hopes that the suggestions I have presented to your friendship may open better prospects 
for us. She begs to close this letter ; so I will only add, I hope we shall soon learn where we may look for the happiness of embracing you ; being

Ever, my dear Devereux, faithfully yours,

P. S. We have just heard of a new work on the Colombian Revolution, with which we are impatient to 
meet, that we may follow the march of your fame. Apro pos de la marche, I have composed some military ones, of 
which I hope your Excellency will hereafter select one, to be enhanced by your accepting its dedication.
