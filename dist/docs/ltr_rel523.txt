I received last night, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse sweetheart met">Mary</a>, your letter of the 12th, and am
delighted to learn that you are all well and so many of you are
together.  I am much pleased that Fitzhugh has an opportunity to be
with you all and will not be so far removed from his home in his new
field of action.  I hope to see him at the head of a find regiment
and that he will be able to do good service in the cause of his country.
If <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse sweetheart met">Mary</a> and Rob get to you Christmas, you will have quite a family
party, especially if Fitzhugh is not obliged to leave his home and
sweet wife before that time.  I shall think of you all on that holy
day more intensely than usual, and shall pray to the great God of
Heaven to shower His blessings upon you in this world, and to unite
you all in His courts in the world to come.  With a grateful heart I
thank Him for His preservation thus far, and trust to His mercy and
kindness for the future.  Oh, that I were more worthy, more thankful
for all He has done and continues to do for me!  Perry and Meredith
[his two coloured servants] send their respects to all....
