DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
In my last of May 2Oth, I mentioned my hopes that we 
should at length get over all obstructions to the repeal of the 
act restraining the legal tender of paper money; but those 
hopes are now greatly lessened. 
</p><p>
The ministry had agreed to the repeal, and the notion that 
had possessed them, that they might make a revenue from 
paper money in appropriating the interest by Parliament, was 
pretty well removed by my assuring them, that it was my 
opinion no colony would make money on those terms, and that 
the benefits arising to the commerce of this country in America 
from a plentiful currency would therefore be lost, and the 
repeal answer no end, if the Assemblies were not allowed to 
appropriate the interest themselves; that the crown might 
get a great share upon occasional requisitions, I made no 
doubt, by voluntary appropriations of the Assemblies; but 
they would never establish such funds as to make themselves 
unnecessary to government. Those and other reasons, that 
were urged, seemed to satisfy them, so that we began to think 
all would go on smoothly, and the merchants prepared their 
petition, on which the repeal was to be founded. But in 
the House, when the chancellor of the Exchequer had gone 
through his proposed American revenue, viz. by duties on 
glass, china ware, paper, pasteboard, colours, tea, &c., 
Grenville stood up and undervalued them all as trifles ; and, 
says he, "I will tell the honourable gentleman of a revenue, 
that will produce something valuable in America; make 
paper money for the colonies, issue it upon loan there, take 
the interest, and apply it as you think proper." Mr. Townshend, finding the House listened to this and seemed to like 
it, stood up again and said, "that was a proposition of his 
own, which he had intended to make with the rest, but it had 
slipt his memory, and the gentleman, who must have heard of 
it, now unfairly would take advantage of that slip and make 
a merit to himself of a proposition that was another's, and as 
a proof of it, assured the House a bill was prepared for the 
purpose, and would be laid before them." 
</p><p>
This startled all our friends ; and the merchants concluded 
to keep back their petition for a while, till things appeared a 
little clearer, lest their friends in America should blame them, 
as having furnished foundation for an act, that must have 
been disagreeable to the colonies. I found the rest of the 
ministry did not like this proceeding of the chancellor's, but there was no going on with our scheme against his declaration, and, as he daily talked of resigning, there being no good 
agreement between him and the rest, and as we found the 
general prejudice against the colonies so strong in the House, 
that any thing in the shape of a favour to them all was like 
to meet with opposition, whether he was out or in, I proposed 
to Mr. Jackson the putting our colony foremost, as we stood 
in a pretty good light, and asking the favour for us alone. 
This he agreed might be proper, in case the chancellor should 
go out, and undertook to bring in a bill for that purpose, provided the <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> merchants would petition for it, and 
he wished to have such a petition ready to present, if an opening for it should offer. Accordingly I applied to them, and 
prepared a draft of a petition for them to sign, a copy of which 
I send you inclosed. They seemed generally for the measure ; 
but apprehending the merchants of the other colonies, who 
had hitherto gone hand in hand with us in all American 
affairs, might take umbrage if we now separated from them, 
it was thought right to call a meeting of the whole to consult 
upon this proposal. 
</p><p>
At this meeting I represented to them, as the ground of this 
measure, that, the colonies being generally out of favour at 
present, any hard clause relating to paper money in the repealing bill will be more easily received in Parliament, if the 
bill related to all the colonies : that Pennsylvania, being in 
some degree of favour, might possibly alone obtain a better 
act than the whole could do, as it might by government be 
thought as good policy to show favour where there had been 
the reverse ; that a good act obtained by Pennsylvania might 
another year, when the resentment against the colonies should 
be abated, be made use of as a precedent, &c. &c. But after 
a good deal of debate it was finally concluded not to precipitate matters, it being very dangerous by any kind of petition 
to furnish the chancellor with a horse on which he could put 
what saddle he thought fit: The other merchants seemed 
rather averse to the Pennsylvania merchants proceeding alone, 
but said they were certainly at liberty to do as they thought 
proper. The conclusion of the Pennsylvania merchants was 
to wait a while, holding the separate petition ready to sign 
and present, if a proper opening should appear this session, 
but otherwise to reserve it to the next, when the complexion 
of ministers and measures may probably be changed. And 
as this session now draws to a conclusion, I begin to think 
nothing will be farther done in it this year. 
</p><p>
Mentioning the merchants, puts me in mind of some discourse I heard among them, that was by no means agreeable. 
It was said that in the opposition they gave the Stamp Act, 
and their endeavours to obtain the repeal, they had spent at 
their meetings, and in expresses to all parts of this country, 
and for a vessel to carry the joyful news to North America, 
and in the entertainments given our friends of both Houses, 
&c., near fifteen hundred pounds; that for all this, except 
from the little colony of Rhode Island, they had not received 
as much as a thank ye. That on the contrary the circular 
letters they had written with the best intentions to the merchants of the several colonies, containing their best and most 
friendly advice, were either answered with unkind reflections, 
or contemptuously left without answer. And that the captain 
of the vessel, they sent express with the news, having met with 
misfortunes, that obliged him to travel by land through all 
the colonies from New Hampshire to Pennsylvania, was 
everywhere treated with neglect and contempt, instead of 
</p><p>
civility and hospitality; and nowhere more than at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, where, though he delivered letters to the merchants, 
that must make him and his errand known to them, no one 
took the least notice of him. I own I was ashamed to hear 
all this, but hope there is some mistake in it. I should not 
have troubled you with this account, but that I think we stand 
in truth greatly obliged to the merchants, who are a very 
respectable body, and whose friendship is worth preserving, 
as it may greatly help us on future occasions ; and therefore 
I wish some decent acknowledgments or thanks were sent 
from the Assemblies of the colonies, since their correspondents 
have omitted it. 
</p><p>
I have said the less of late in my letters concerning the 
petitions, because I hoped this summer to have an opportunity of communicating every thing vivd, voce, and there are 
particulars that cannot safely be trusted to paper. Perhaps 
I may be more determined as to returning or staying another 
winter, when I receive my next letters from you and my other 
friends in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
We got the chancellor to drop his salt duty. And the merchants trading to Portugal and Spain, he says, have made 
such a clamour about the intention of suffering ships to go 
directly with wine, fruit, and oil, from those countries to 
America, that he has dropped that scheme, and we are it 
seems to labour a little longer under the inconveniences of 
the restraint. 
</p><p>
It is said the bill to suspend the legislatures of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
and Georgia, till they comply with the act of Parliament for 
quartering soldiers, will pass this session. ] fear that imprudencies on both sides may, step by step, bring on the most 
mischievous consequences. It is imagined here, that this 
act will enforce immediate compliance; and if the people 
should be quiet, content themselves with the laws they have, 
and let the matter rest, till in some future war the King wanting aids from them, and finding himself restrained in his legislation by the act as much as the people, shall think fit by his 
ministers to propose the repeal, the Parliament will be greatly 
disappointed; and perhaps it may take this turn. I wish 
nothing worse may happen. 
</p><p>
The present ministry will probably continue through this 
session. But their disagreement, with the total inability of 
Lord Chatham, through sickness, to do any business, must 
bring on some change before next winter. I wish it may be 
for the better, but fear the contrary. 
</p><p>
Please to present my dutiful respects to the Assembly, and 
believe me ever, dear Sir, your and the Committee's most 
</p><p>
obedient and faithful humble servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
