</p><p>
I am beginning to believe that we are even of more 
importance in <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> than we thought we 
were. It is laughable to hear the things a certain 
set of people, who know they can't visit us, say 
about the whole family. . . . When father was alive, 
they dared not talk about us aloud, beyond calling 
us the "Proud Morgans" and the "Aristocracy of 
<a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>" . . . But now father is gone, the 
people imagine we are public property, to be criticized, vilified, and abused to their hearts content. . . . 
</p><p>
And now, because they find absurdities don't succeed, they try improbabilities. So yesterday the 
town was in a ferment because it was reported the 
Federal officers had called on the Miss Morgans, and 
all the gentlemen were anxious to hear how they had 
been received. One had the grace to say, "If they 
did, they received the best lesson there that they 
could get in town ; those young ladies would meet 
them with the true Southern spirit." The rest did not 
know; they would like to find out. 
</p><p>
I suppose the story originated from the fact that 
we were unwilling to blackguard yes, that is the 
word the Federal officers here, and would not 
agree with many of our friends in saying they were 
liars, thieves, murderers, scoundrels, the scum of 
the earth, etc. Such epithets are unworthy of 
ladies, I say, and do harm, rather than advance our 
cause. Let them be what they will, it shall not make 
me less the lady; I say it is unworthy of anything 
except low newspaper war, such abuse, and I will 
not join in. 
</p><p>
I have a brother-in-law in the Federal army whom 
I love and respect as much as any one in the world, 
and shall not readily agree that his being a Northerner would give him an irresistible desire to pick 
my pockets, and take from him all power of telling 
the truth. No! There are few men I admire more 
than Major Drum, and I honor him for his independence in doing what he believes right. Let us 
have liberty of speech and action in our land, I say, 
but not gross abuse and calumny. Shall I acknowledge that the people we so recently called our 
brothers are unworthy of consideration, and are liars, 
cowards, dogs? Not I! // they conquer us, I 
acknowledge them as a superior race ; I will not say 
that we were conquered by cowards, for where would 
that place us? It will take a brave people to gain us, 
and that the Northerners undoubtedly are. I would 
scorn to have an inferior foe ; I fight only my equals. 
These women may acknowledge that cowards have 
won battles in which their brothers were engaged, 
but I, I will ever say mine fought against brave men, 
and won the day. Which is most honorable? 
</p><p>
I was never a Secessionist, for I quietly adopted 
father's views on political subjects without meddling 
with them. But even father went over with his 
State, and when so many outrages were committed 
by the fanatical leaders of the North, though he 
regretted the Union, said, "Fight to the death for 
our liberty." I say so, too. I want to fight until we 
win the cause so many have died for. I don't believe 
in Secession, but I do in Liberty. I want the South 
to conquer, dictate its own terms, and go back to 
the Union, for I believe that, apart, inevitable ruin 
awaits both. It is a rope of sand, this Confederacy, 
founded on the doctrine of Secession, and will not 
last many years not five. The North Cannot sub 
due us. We are too determined to be free. They have 
no right to confiscate our property to pay debts they 
themselves have incurred. Death as a nation, rather 
than Union on such terms. We will have our rights 
secured on so firm a basis that it can never be shaken. 
If by power of overwhelming numbers they conquer 
us, it will be a barren victory over a desolate land. 
We, the natives of this loved soil, will be beggars in 
a foreign land; we will not submit to despotism 
under the garb of Liberty. The North will find 
herself burdened with an unparalleled debt, with 
nothing to show for it except deserted towns, 
burning homes, a standing army which will govern 
with no small caprice, and an impoverished land. 
If that be treason, make the best of it!
