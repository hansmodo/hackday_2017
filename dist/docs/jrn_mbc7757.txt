Serena went for a half-hour to-day to the dentist. Her teeth are of the whitest and most regular, simply perfection.

Brewster was here and stayed till midnight. Said he must see General Chesnut. He had business with him. 
His " me and <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>General Hood</a> " is no longer cornic. He described <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman's</a> march of destruction and desolation. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> leaves a track fifty miles wide, upon which there is no living thing to be seen," said Brewster before he departed.
