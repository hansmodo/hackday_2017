Ah, my dear friend, what misery are we enduring ! How can Mr. Crawford be so 
unfeeling? I thought you had certainly received every information about your beloved Payne, and was in hopes from day to 
day that it would come to Mr. C. s recollection, also, what my feelings must be. 
But alas ! not one word from him. William Nicholson (whom you may remember lived 
with us) tells me that Mr. Crawford wrote to Mr. Gallatin that the ship could not be 
detained on account of Mr. Bayard, and that Mr. Gallatin answered it was impossible for them to be at Plymouth before 
the 24th of June, and that they sailed immediately without waiting for any further 
information from them. It is proved, to be sure, that there was no time to be lost, for 
poor Mr. Bayard died the sixth day after their arrival. Mr. Crawford I can never 
forgive for not attending a little to our feelings. Oh ! what anguish there is in 
disappointed hope. Our servant, Henry, has arrived in the Neptune with all Mr. 
Gallatin s and James s baggage ; I have written to Captain Jones to send them on 
here to me with Henry, who is a faithful, excellent creature. His family live in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>, and I presume he will be anxious to go and see them. I will then get 
him to take charge of all the things be longing to Payne and yourself, and deliver 
them in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>. I am told he was much distressed at the ship s sailing with out his master.

I have seen in the newspaper that a vessel had arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, direct from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, left there the 26th of June, and the captain says was to have brought out 
Messrs. Clay, Gallatin, and suite, but they afterwards concluded to sail from Liverpool. I presume from this that they had 
finished the treaty, and we may expect them any moment. I think they will come 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and the instant they arrive, my dear friend, I will let you know of it. 
You and I can best feel for one another. In the mean time, if Mr. Crawford should 
give you any information about them, do let me know ; at all events, write to me, 
like a dear friend. I believe the captain on board is careful, and we need not feel 
uneasy about our properties ; but what a disappointment to those left behind, all 
the clothes they needed at sea, besides little conveniences which will be hard for my 
poor husband, who is distressedly sick at sea, and Henry was his nurse. I can neither eat nor sleep, after all my anxiety 
about the Neptune, that she should arrive without my husband and child. It is, indeed, distressing beyond anything, and I 
fear to expect them, lest I should have an other disappointment. It must be a comfort to you to have your sister with you, 
and it is a pleasure to me to hear that she and her children are well. Pray remember 
me to her, and to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="colleague met">Mr. Madison</a>. Heaven bless you.

Ever your affectionate friend,
