                      To Mrs. Clemens, in Hartford:
</p><p>
CHICAGO, Nov. 14 '79.
</p><p>
A little after 5 in the morning.
</p><p>
I've just come to my room, Livy darling, I guess this was the memorable
night of my life.  By George, I never was so stirred since I was born.
I heard four speeches which I can never forget.  One by Emory Storrs, one
by Gen. Vilas (O, wasn't it wonderful!) one by Gen. Logan (mighty
stirring), one by somebody whose name escapes me, and one by that
splendid old soul, Col. Bob Ingersoll,--oh, it was just the supremest
combination of English words that was ever put together since the world
began.  My soul, how handsome he looked, as he stood on that table, in
the midst of those 500 shouting men, and poured the molten silver from
his lips!  Lord, what an organ is human speech when it is played by a
master!  All these speeches may look dull in print, but how the lightning
glared around them when they were uttered, and how the crowd roared in
response!  It was a great night, a memorable night.  I am so richly
repaid for my journey--and how I did wish with all my whole heart that
you were there to be lifted into the very seventh heaven of enthusiasm,
as I was.  The army songs, the military music, the crashing applause
--Lord bless me, it was unspeakable.
</p><p>
Out of compliment they placed me last in the list--No. 15--I was to "hold
the crowd"--and bless my life I was in awful terror when No. 14. rose,
at a o'clock this morning and killed all the enthusiasm by delivering the
flattest, insipidest, silliest of all responses to "Woman" that ever a
weary multitude listened to.  Then <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wts" rel="met">Gen. Sherman</a> (Chairman) announced my
toast, and the crowd gave me a good round of applause as I mounted on top
of the dinner table, but it was only on account of my name, nothing more
--they were all tired and wretched.  They let my first sentence go in.
silence, till I paused and added "we stand on common ground"--then they
burst forth like a hurricane and I saw that I had them!  From that time
on, I stopped at the end of each sentence, and let the tornado of
applause and laughter sweep around me--and when I closed with "And if the
child is but the prophecy of the man, there are mighty few who will doubt
that he succeeded," I say it who oughtn't to say it, the house came down
with a crash.  For two hours and a half, now, I've been shaking hands and
listening to congratulations.  Gen. Sherman said, "Lord bless you, my
boy, I don't know how you do it--it's a secret that's beyond me--but it
was great--give me your hand again."
</p><p>
And do you know, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Gen. Grant</a> sat through fourteen speeches like a graven
image, but I fetched him!  I broke him up, utterly!  He told me he
laughed till the tears came and every bone in his body ached.  (And do
you know, the biggest part of the success of the speech lay in the fact
that the audience saw that for once in his life he had been knocked out
of his iron serenity.)
</p><p>
Bless your soul, 'twas immense.  I never was so proud in my life.  Lots
and lots of people--hundreds I might say--told me my speech was the
triumph of the evening--which was a lie.  Ladies, Tom, Dick and Harry
--even the policemen--captured me in the halls and shook hands, and
scores of army officers said "We shall always be grateful to you for
coming." <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jop" rel="met">General Pope</a> came to bunt me up--I was afraid to speak to him on
that theatre stage last night, thinking it might be presumptuous to
tackle a man so high up in military history.  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jms" rel="met">Gen. Schofield</a>, and other
historic men, paid their compliments.  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=phs" rel="met">Sheridan</a> was ill and could not
come, but I'm to go with a General of his staff and see him before I go
to Col. Grant's.  Gen. Augur--well, I've talked with them all, received
invitations from them all--from people living everywhere--and as I said
before, it's a memorable night.  I wouldn't have missed it for anything
in the world.
</p><p>
But my sakes, you should have heard Ingersoll's speech on that table!
Half an hour ago he ran across me in the crowded halls and put his arms
about me and said "Mark, if I live a hundred years, I'll always be
grateful for your speech--Lord what a supreme thing it was."  But I told
him it wasn't any use to talk, he had walked off with the honors of that
occasion by something of a majority.  Bully boy is Ingersoll--traveled
with him in the cars the other day, and you can make up your mind we had
a good time.
</p><p>
Of course I forgot to go and pay for my hotel car and so secure it, but
the army officers told me an hour ago to rest easy, they would go at
once, at this unholy hour of the night and compel the railways to do
their duty by me, and said "You don't need to request the Army of the
Tennessee to do your desires--you can command its services."
</p><p>
Well, I bummed around that banquet hall from 8 in the evening till 2 in
the morning, talking with people and listening to speeches, and I never
ate a single bite or took a sup of anything but ice water, so if I seem
excited now, it is the intoxication of supreme enthusiasm.  By George, it
was a grand night, a historical night.
</p><p>
And now it is a quarter past 6 A.M.--so good bye and God bless you and
the Bays,--[Family word for babies]--my darlings
