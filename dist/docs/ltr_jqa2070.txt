TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE

No. 33 [EDMUND RANDOLPH] 
</p><p>
THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, April 14, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
The popular commotions at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> mentioned in a late 
letter, of which the scarcity of provisions is represented 
as the pretence, and the intrigues of the Jacobin party as the 
cause, became from day to day more alarming until the first 
of the present month, on which day a very numerous collection of people forced the doors of the Convention, filled 
the Hall of its session for several hours, interrupted every 
member who addressed them by vociferations for bread, and 
finally retired upon information that the armed force of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> was marching to the relief of the Convention. When 
the freedom of deliberation was restored to the Assembly 
they declared the city of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> to be in a state of siege, and 
gave the command of the Parisian army to General Pichegru, who happened then to be in Paris, where he had recently arrived to concert arrangements for the ensuing campaign, previous to his assuming the command of the Army 
of Rhine and Moselle. The most liberal extension was 
given to his powers for the purpose of restoring order and 
tranquility, but this special authority was to continue only 
so long as the danger which existed. 
</p><p>
The process which had been carried on with certain formalities against the four members of the former Committees was abruptly broken off, and a decree was passed 
that they should be immediately transported out of the Republic. 
</p><p>
Eight members among the most violent of the remaining 
Jacobins were ordered to be arrested and sent to the castle 
of Ham in Picardy, and although every effort was made to 
prevent the execution of these decrees yet it was finally 
effected, and on the 5th instant nine more members of the 
Convention were ordered under arrest. From the most 
recent accounts it appears that the public tranquility is 
restored, and that General Pichegru was on the point of 
setting out to join the army. 
</p><p>
The object of those by whom this insurrection was instigated is generally said to have been the dissolution of the Convention. It is probable that the subsequent purpose 
was very different among those who combined together in this transaction ; that of the Jacobins to restore the reign of 
popular societies and Revolutionary Committees, and that of the Royalists to crown the infant prisoner in the Temple. 
That a plan of the latter kind was connected with the events of that day appears probable from various circumstances. 
I have already mentioned the symptoms of sedition and prelude to insurrection, which took place at the same moment 
throughout this province. It is now known that it appeared equally in the other provinces of this Republic, and it was 
on the same day and at the same hour when the attack was made upon the Convention at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>. What connection 
it had with any Prussian negotiation now on foot is impossible for me to discover. The armistice between the Prussian 
and French armies had at that time commenced. The French had quitted the Prussian territories beyond the 
Rhine on the frontiers of this country. The Prussian army under General Mollendorf was marching into Westphalia. 
A report was propagated with a confidence which seemed to make the very improbability of the fact an argument for 
its truth, that the French armies in this country would 
immediately withdraw, and that the Prussians were already 
within this territory. 
</p><p>
This conjuration of Prussians was it seems equally used 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, where it was reported there were 30,000 of them 
in the Bois de Boulogne, only four miles out of the city ; 
and absurd as the story was, a member of the Committee 
of Surety General thought it necessary to go personally 
to the place in order to ascertain what was the fact. 
</p><p>
There is indeed a negotiation of public notoriety proceed 
ing between French and Prussian ministers at Basle, and the 
present armistice is generally supposed to be simply preliminary to the conclusion of a peace. If the hopes of the 
Orangeists or the fears of the Patriots here, hopes and fears 
neither of which are avowed, but which neither party can 
disguise, could be admitted as proofs, it would be certain 
that the situation of this country is the principal object of 
their negotiations. In every other respect the parties are 
supposed to be agreed. 
</p><p>
The hopes of the ancient Court party are that the French 
by the treaty will stipulate to withdraw their troops and, 
without interfering with the affairs of this people, merely 
abandon the party triumphant hitherto by their protection. 
This is all they wish, and they are perfectly sanguine that 
in such case the Stadtholdcr would be restored and the 
present government annihilated in less than a week of time. 
</p><p>
On the other hand the plenipotentiaries have not been 
received by the Convention, and the Committee of Public 
Safety with whom they are negotiating demand conditions 
to the conclusion of the alliance almost impossible to per 
form, and which have given an alarm to the Patriots, 
which is the more plainly seen from the endeavours to conceal it. One hundred millions of guilders to be paid in 
specie, a loan of an equal sum, the ships which compose the 
relics of their navy, the fortresses on their frontiers, such 
are the demands which though now reduced by one-half 
are still considered as an intolerable price for an alliance that 
is indispensable. Yet even these terms will be submitted 
to, grievous as they are, if the alternative is to be abandoned 
to their own defence. The French government can undoubtedly prescribe its own conditions, but if they insist 
upon receiving even the one hundred millions, they must 
promise the services of their armies here to ensure the 
collection of the money. 
</p><p>
The disunion among the people here and their dissatisfaction with the government as it now stands increase from day to day. The calling of a national convention is yet 
much talked of, but the present possessors of government do not appear anxious to be relieved from their burden of public 
authority, or to lay aside the extraordinary weight of responsibility that rests upon men who, under a semblance 
of popular election not remarkably accurate or regular, have 
torn up by the roots an ancient Constitution, and established 
in its stead a temporary dominion, equally variant from the 
former practice and the present theory, a dominion the 
measures of which must perpetually recur for justification 
or excuse to the necessity of the case, and which nothing but 
the present prospect of its speedy termination renders for a moment tolerable. 
</p><p>
At any rate, and under any course of events now within 
the bounds of probability, this Republic may be said to be 
irretrievably ruined. For besides the sums required by 
France, one hundred and twenty-five millions of guilders 
are necessary to supply the payment of arrearages due by 
the former government. With a commerce stagnated, with 
manufactures scarcely extant, with public payments suspended, with a country which has just suffered the invasion 
of an enemy, and the most destructive protection of an ally, 
subjected at once to ravages of war and the ruin of inundations, with a people divided into two parties, nearly 
equal, inveterate against nothing so much as one another, with a dominant party discordant among themselves and a 
national character timid, irresolute, averse to sacrifices and considering property as the most precious of all human 
blessings, the most sanguine Patriot can discover in the future destiny of this country nothing but subjection, aggravated by the recollection of its former glories, and wretchedness, embittered by the memory of its former opulence. 
</p><p>
The expedition from Toulon supposed to have been in 
tended against Corsica is abandoned. A partial engagement 
between the French and English squadrons in the Mediterranean has taken place. The former have lost two ships of the line and taken one.
</p><p>
The misunderstanding between the courts of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. petersburg" rel="city">St. Petersburg</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=berlin" rel="city">Berlin</a> becomes more accredited from day to day, 
and it is probable that the King of Prussia has reason to take umbrage from a negotiation, the object of which is an alliance between Austria, Russia and Great Britain. 
</p><p>
It is this day reported that a courier has arrived, bringing to the French Representatives in this place intelligence, 
that a peace has been concluded between the Republic of France and the King of Prussia.
</p><p>
I received two days since a letter from Mr. Pinckney of March 3Oth, in which he mentions his intention to proceed 
in about a fortnight from that time upon his mission to Madrid. He sent me by the same conveyance a packet from the Department of State containing the newspapers 
to the 19th of December. 
</p><p>
I have the honor &c.
