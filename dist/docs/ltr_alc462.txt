Dear Henry:-
</p><p>
   Once more amid the scenes of confusion
and surrounded by the walls of Franklin Hall is Ellic,
your old friend, this morning I got in the carriage &
was hurried away from the loved scenes of home, by
the gentle pace of faithful "Lade" and after two
hours ride was again at the place of study, and sur-
rounded by the hum and bustle of a county town.
</p><p>
    I enjoyed my trip home very much, and consider that
I would have loosed a great privilege, if not permitted to give my assistance in reaping the harvest; none
but the experienced know the value and comfort
of county labor until deprived of its blessings.
I think a life in the county, surrounded by nature's robes
of green, basking in the sun shine of heavenly purity, freed
from the clamour and confusion of a county town,
breathing in the health and vigor of a county home, and
reclining under family protection and affection,
one of heaven's richest blessings. 
</p><p>
It is reported to day that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gbm" rel="none">Gen. McClellan</a> has
routed the Secessionist entirely, and taken about
sixteen hundred prisoners, "good for him", may
he ever be successful in his efforts to protect
the rights of American citizens. And may his right
arm be strengthened by every battle strife, and may
God unnerve every arm that would raise
to aid in the destruction of this the home
of the [ free] and the assylum of [ the] oppressed.
</p><p>
    Henry I did not get to Uncle Michael's,
Wallace's, or Kyner's, but I know you will get
Kyner's name to your petition without my inter-
cession in your behalf. however I know I
would have enjoyed a visit with you to
the [ two] latter named places, and will hope better
the next time I come home, which I hope will
be when the huckelberries are ripe. As this
is my second letter to day, I will close by
asking you to remember me to the people
of the pines who are solicitous enough to enquire
of me.
</p><p>
Your Friend,
</p><p>
Ellic
</p><p>
  Since this was written Aunt received a
letter from Uncle Stumbaugh, he says that
Gen. Patterson assures him that if Johnson
did not attack him that he ( Patterson)
would attack Johnson before the term of
the three months men would have
expired, so lookout for a fight the
last of this week, or a retreat on
the part of the rebels,
</p><p>
Yours,
</p>
