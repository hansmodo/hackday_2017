My Dear Ellen:--Your kind letter of September 8th reached me by the last mail. Often when in a melancholy mood of mind have I sat down and perused your letters over and over again, and they have nerved me up and driven all such feelings away. If I had not one like you to correspond with, one in whom I can confide and trust, I scarcely know what I should do. Next to the pleasure of reading a letter from you in this far-off region is that of gazing upon your likeness.
</p><p>
I am perfectly well satisfied that you love for no sinister motives, at least not for wealth, for you always knew I was poor, and I know full well that your greeting would be the same did I return without a dime, as if laden with the riches of Croesus. That I am anxious to return, you cannot doubt. My motto is, 'Fear not, but trust in Providence' that I shall be enabled not to be absent much longer.
</p><p>
We now have a post office at this place and as I
expect to remain here during the winter, you may hereafter direct my letters to Sonora, California. They will be brought by mail instead of by express.
</p><p>
I wish you a happy Christmas. And now, my dear Ellen, I must close, with my prayers for your happiness and our speedy meeting, and in the meantime, I will subscribe myself,
</p><p>
Ever your loving
</p><p>
