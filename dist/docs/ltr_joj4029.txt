Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have lately received a letter from Francis Child, a lad whom I had taken by the hand after his father's death, and 
put apprentice to Mr. Dunlap, your printer. He complains that Dunlap refuses to give him the clothes stipulated in the 
indentures, and requests that I will save him from nakedness. You will oblige me by giving him twenty-five bard 
dollars, or the amount of it in paper. If you can conveniently discover how he behaves and is like to turn out, I 
beg you will inform me ; for, as his father bad a warm and steady attachment to me, I feel myself interested in the welfare of this son, who it seems was his favourite. 
</p><p>
My friend, you are not a little indebted to me on the score of letters. One only has reached me. I am content 
to go on writing two or three for one, but really you must let us hear sometimes of you and Mrs. Morris. There are 
some hearts which, like feathers, stick to every thing they touch, and quit each with equal case. Mine is not one of this 
kind ; it adheres to few, but it takes strong hold ; you must, therefore, write to me ; and if you would make your letter 
very agreeable, dwell on tbe objects you will find at or near the hills, and within your own walls. Mrs. Jay writes 
by this opportunity to Mrs. Morris, whom she loves and esteems for many reasons unnecessary to repeat to you.

Should the following cipher reach you safe, we may afterward write with less reserve. Entick's Spelling Dictionary, 
printed in <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>, paged backwards. The last page in the 
book is numbered 468. Let this be page the first, and mark the first page (which is the titlepage) 468. Count the 
words from the top, distinguishing the columns by a [.] over the first figure for the first column, and a [.] over the second 
figure for the second column. For instance, the word absent is the fifth word in the first column of the 434th page, and is to be thus written : 5.434. 
</p><p>
Remember me to your friends, Mr. and Mrs. Mease, and your other usual guests near the hills. I wish I had a 
few such honest, open-hearted companions here. God bless you. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, very sincerely, your friend, 6cc.
