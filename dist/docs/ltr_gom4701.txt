Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
This will accompany duplicates of my letters of the I 5th 
and 18th of last month. The season continues fine and for 
ward, with every appearance of an abundant crop; and, judging from the productions now at market, the harvest will pre 
cede the usual time near a month. 
</p><p>
You will see in the gazettes the taking of Landrecy, and 
the foreign papers, particularly the English papers, will give 
you the details on that subject which we want. There has 
been much fighting in that quarter, and although, as is usual, 
the success may have been varied, it appears definitively to 
have rested with the Allies, seeing that they have not been 
forced to raise the siege, but have taken the town. 
</p><p>
I am told that the Republic now feed ten hundred and 
thirty thousand infantry, and ninety-four thousand cavalry. 
This is an immense army even on paper, and although we 
may easily suppose that there is some little exaggeration in the 
numbers, that there are some abuses in the account, and that 
casualties diminish considerably those who are really on the 
rolls, still it will appear that the force is very great. The daily expense of the provision department is about a million of 
dollars. 
I learn also, that the Comite de Salut Public have agreed to 
be unanimous, so that the minority always adhere to the majority. This Committee, and that of Surete Generate must, I 
think, be either melted into one, or else have a contest for superiority. At present, the efficient power of the State is lodged with those Committees, and the former begin to publish 
their decrees, which have the force of laws, modifying, adding 
to, and repealing those of the Convention. It seems to me 
that this Committee are not yet fully apprized of the extent of 
their own authority ; that is to say, of the wide and deep effect 
of the terror, which has been excited by such frequent and 
abundant executions as take place throughout France. I 
think they may do what they please, provided the revolutionary tribunals remain in their hands. We shall see what system 
is to follow therefrom. 
</p><p>
I am told that Robespierre's wish is to retire to private 
life, so soon as the peace shall have established that form of 
government, which may be finally adopted here. 
</p><p>
Enclosed you have the copy of a letter of the 22d of April, 
from Mr Anderson at Nantes, to me, and of my answer. I 
am, &tc.
