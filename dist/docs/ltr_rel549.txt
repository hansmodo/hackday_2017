My Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse sweetheart met">Mary</a>:  I reached here yesterday about one P.M., and on riding
up to the hotel was met by Professor White, of Washington College, who
brought me up to his father-in-law's, Colonel Reid, the oldest member
of the trustees of the college, where I am very comfortably quartered.
To-day I will look out for accommodations elsewhere, as the Colonel
has a large family and I fear I am intruding upon his hospitality.  I
have not yet visited the college grounds.  They seem to be beautifully
located, and the buildings are undergoing repairs.  The house assigned
to the president, I am told, has been rented to Dr. Madison (I believe),
who has not been able to procure another residence, and I do not know
when it will be vacated, nor can I tell you more about it.  I saw
Mrs. and Colonel Preston, Captain Frank, and his sister.  All the family
are well.  I shall go after breakfast to inquire after my trunks.  I
had a very pleasant journey here.  The first two days were very hot,
but, reaching the mountain region the third day, the temperature was
much cooler.  I came up in four days' easy rides, getting to my
stopping-place by one P.M. each day, except the third, when I slept
on top of the Blue Ridge, which I reached at three P.M.  The scenery
was beautiful all the way.  I am writing before breakfast, and must
be short.  Last night I found a blanket and coverlid rather light
covering, and this morning I see a fire in the dining-room.  I have
thought much of you all since I left.  Give much love to the girls and
Custis and remember me to all at 'Oakland.'
