My Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
You doubtless saw my promotion announced in 
" Orders." I have been exceedingly fortunate, attaining 
a rank which generally requires five or eight years' service in the short period of seventeen months. This 
promotion separated me from the company to which I 
formerly belonged and from a garrison of officers to 
whom I had become much attached, yet I was of course 
rejoiced at being promoted to this company, which 
guards the road between St. Augustine and this place, 
the road upon which so very many murders have been 
committed during the war. I command here a guard, have 
fine quarters, constant communication with the world, 
and although very little society, and no officers with me, 
I can mount my horse, and in a couple of hours can have 
both in the ancient city of St. Augustine, only eighteen 
miles distant. St. Augustine, you know, is the oldest 
town in the United States, nor does its appearance belie 
its age, narrow, winding streets, close-built houses with 
the balconies meeting overhead, denoting its Spanish 
population. There are some few old English families, 
who remained when the Floridas were ceded to Spain, 
and together with the few Americans whom the delightful climate has enticed, constitute the best society. The 
Spaniards, or rather Minorcans, are very ignorant and 
have no desire to travel beyond their own circle. There 
is an old fort, built at enormous cost by the Spanish 
Government; but for want of appropriation, it is fast 
falling to decay. . . . The inhabitants still preserve the 
old ceremonies and festivities of old Spain. Balls, 
masquerades, etc., are celebrated during the gay season of 
the Carnival (just over), and the most religious observance of Lent in public, whilst in private they cannot 
refrain from dancing and making merry. Indeed, I 
never saw anything like it, dancing, dancing, and 
nothing but dancing, but not such as you see at the 
north. Such ease and grace I never before beheld. A 
lady will waltz all the evening without fatigue, because 
it is done slowly, with grace ; but it is in the Spanish 
dance they more especially excel, enchanting all who 
behold or participate. This, together with the easy and 
cordial hospitality all extend to officers, is what has 
captivated so many within the past few years.
