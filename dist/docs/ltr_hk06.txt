Sunnyvale, Calif. <br> Sept. 22, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1918">1918</a> <br><br> Dear Horace:- <br> I received your letter but I was waiting for the pictures. I am sorry I did not 
take some more but will take more later. As for you getting a French girl I think 
that is rather hard on our girls but all the same while you are getting the girl 
you might bring a French boy for me. I haven’t been able to get a soldier so I 
guess I will have to have to get some one to get me one. It has been cold today. 
I just made a mistake for father has just been out and said it was clear as a 
bell. We were down to see your mother and father. They are looking fine. We got 
a box of apples. We took the pictures to show them. They liked them very much. 
I tried to take the pigs but they were too excited to (unintelligible) still because 
they saw two apples on the fence. Everything looks fine at home. I do not think 
your mother worries as much now. I am sending you a paper telling where the boys 
but lots have gone over. I hope it won’t be long till they are all back. Our folks 
went on a hunting trip and Pa got a deer. The boys were real proud of him for 
they were with a lot of old hunters that had killed lots of deer in their time. 
They were Bill Wilson and his brother Grace Mansfield. The girl that played the 
piano at the dances, Ruth Thompson, Gladys Hendy and Margret Knots have all married 
soldiers. Such a lot at once. I do not know any more to date. We have not heard 
from Howard for a long time he is on the training ship Iris. The last time he 
was home he had been on a trip to Santa Cruz. Well I have told you about all there 
is to tell. You know when one sees as much as you have seen lately it is hard 
to tell any body any real news. Ben Gould met Henry Blankin in France and were 
so glad to see each other. That is such a big place I imagine you might go a long 
ways before you would see any one. I am working long hours now. We do peaches, 
pares and tomatoes now last Thursday there was a dreadful rain and spoiled the 
tomatoes so we have not had as many tomatoes lately as we should have had. The 
peaches are very plentiful and I think they have 10 car loads in cold storage 
yet they are very short of help and the boys go to school tomorrow so I don’t 
know what we will do the coming week. The soldier boys are getting out and help 
the prunes and other fruit which is a good thing. We have soldiers come into the 
cannery every few day to look around. I tell the girls they want to see how things 
are put up they have to eat. I think the things are very clean there. We have 
the best foreman that ever lived. I am forelady over the canners this year instead 
of the cutters. I do not like it as well but I earn my money so have to go where 
they say. Mr. Larman has been sick for nearly a month and has not been able to 
be at work. Well the light has been blinking for quite a while so they will go 
out all together and leave me in the dark if I am not in a hurry. Pa told me that 
Laura Hearst had a German helmet sent her from over there. It must be great to 
receive any thing like that. Well I have not written a letter since I [last] wrote 
to you so I am tired now. I should write oftener and get used to it. Well I will 
close as every body is in bed and I have to get up early, but not as early as 
you. I think I will have about 2 ½ more months and I will be through. Well I hop 
you get through over there and come home soon. <br> <br> I remain as ever, <br>
