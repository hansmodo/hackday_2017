Sir, 
</p><p>
I dare to flatter myself, that your Excellency does justice to the very tender and respectful attachment which I have long entertained towards you and that 
you will be persuaded of the great pleasure with 
which I have learned the success that has followed 
the first movements of your administration. After 
having given freedom to your country, it was worthy 
of the virtues and great character of your Excellency, 
to establish her happiness on a solid and permanent 
basis, which is assuredly the result of the new Federal Constitution, in framing which you assisted by 
your counsel, and which you now support as much 
by the splendor of your talents and patriotism, as 
by the eminent situation confided to you by your 
fellow-citizens. They possess the advantage of enjoying more particularly your beneficence, and the 
honor of having you born among them. But I dare 
to assure you, that the consideration which you enjoy throughout Europe, and particularly in my country, yields not even to that which you have obtained 
in your native land ; and, notwithstanding the prejudices of the people with whom I live here, there is 
not one among them who does not pronounce your 
name with sentiments of respect and veneration. All 
are acquainted with the services you have rendered 
to your country, as their General, in the course of 
the war, and with those, perhaps still greater, which 
you now render as a statesman, in peace. 
</p><p>
The love of glory and of freedom, which led the 
Americans to surmount such great difficulties, must 
still prevail, after surmounting them, to establish the 
principles of justice towards those of their fellow citizens and strangers who assisted them in their 
distress ; and I have seen, with great pleasure, that, 
from the first moment in which you have appeared at 
the head of the Federal Government, the credit of 
the American nation has been established in every 
country of Europe, and that the confidence in her 
resources and means is infinitely better founded, 
than in many of the older powers. It is beyond 
doubt that it will take still greater consistency, and 
that the freest country in the world ought also to be 
that which should enjoy the most extensive public 
credit. 
</p><p>
I am too well acquainted with your sentiments for 
France, not to be convinced of the interest which you 
take in her present position. The vices of an ancient 
and vitiated administration could not be reformed, 
even by the virtues of a King, who loves his people, 
and who has many qualities to make them happy. 
Some revolution was required in the form of the monarchy, and, above all, in setting bounds to the Ministerial authority in matters of finance. It was likewise necessary, that the liberty of the citizen should 
be assured, by a conclusive law, of which we were 
totally destitute. It is this which induced the King 
to assemble the States-General, who might easily have 
made some useful reforms, leaving the monarchy to 
subsist, or at least reforming it but slowly and partially. But the love of liberty, and still more the 
exaltation of opinions, have carried us too far ; they 
have overturned every thing, without rebuilding any 
thing, which has reduced us to a very disagreeable 
situation for the moment. I hope that time will a 
little moderate opinions, and that we shall recur to 
true principles; and that, in assuring the liberty of 
the citizen, they will restore the authority of the 
Executive power, which is the soul of a great empire. 
If we can arrive at that state of things, I am persuaded the subject will have gained infinitely, and 
that even the position of the King will be more happy than it formerly was. But, unfortunately, to attain 
this situation we must reiterate a very thorny career; 
and our French heads are little fitted for such proofs. 
</p><p>
Your ancient friend, the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, finds 
himself at the head of the revolution ; and it is indeed a very fortunate circumstance for the State that 
he is, but very little so for himself. Never has any 
man been placed in a more critical situation. A 
good citizen, a faithful subject, he is embarrassed 
by a thousand difficulties in making many people 
sensible of what is proper, who very often feel it not, 
and who sometimes will not understand what it is. 
</p><p>
He has occasion for all the aid of that wisdom and 
prudence which he acquired under your tuition; and 
assuredly he has hitherto proved himself worthy of 
his master, having supported the most difficult situation with the rarest talents and most astonishing foresight. I have the honor to be, with a very sincere 
and very respectful attachment, your Excellency's 
Most humble and most obedient servant.
