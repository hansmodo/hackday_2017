<p>
TO GENERAL DIX.<br>
(Private and confidential.)
</p><p>
EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON<br>
October 26, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1862">1862</a>.
</p><p>
MAJOR-GENERAL Dix, Fort Monroe, Virginia:
</p><p>
Your despatch to Mr. Stanton, of which the enclosed is a copy, has
been handed me by him. It would be dangerous for me now to begin
construing and making specific applications of the proclamation.
</p><p>
It is obvious to all that I therein intended to give time and
opportunity. Also, it is seen I left myself at liberty to exempt
parts of States. Without saying more, I shall be very glad if any
Congressional district will, in good faith, do as your despatch
contemplates.
</p><p>
Could you give me the facts which prompted you to telegraph?
</p><p>
Yours very truly,
</p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=abl" rel="me">A. LINCOLN.</a>
