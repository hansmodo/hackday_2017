It was at Sherman that we commenced our descent down the Pacific Slope. From that point which is the continental watershed, the waters divide and flow in opposite directions, west to the Pacific, and east to the Atlantic ocean. The descent is like the ascent, so gradual that you would scarcely perceive it. The Black Hills are to be seen in the distance, which take their name from the fact that they are clad with pines, giving them a dark and gloomy appearance. It is a wild region, the favorite domain of still wilder Indians, who, in addition to their pastimes of hunting and fishing, frequently attack and plunder emigrant trains and other parties of white men passing through the country. Not long since a skirmish occurred near here between the Indians and a detachment of soldiers, who had been sent out from the Fort for the purpose of
recovering stolen horses. In the encounter three Indians and one white man were killed. Soon after passing Sherman, we were overtaken by a freakish snow storm, the first of the season, which whitened the ground to the depth of two or three inches. The country here assumes a new aspect, being diversified with a multitude of rounded hills as naked as when born into the world, and yet resembling the ruins of old dilapidated cities. Here and there you will recognize among them a hill still retaining the perfect outline of an old church of the gothic style, an ancient castle perhaps of the feudal age, or a weather-beaten farmhouse, such as were built in early days by the New England Puritans. It would seem as if Nature, tired of waiting for man, had here undertaken to build cities on her own account, and had succeeded.

In this direction there is a plenty of wild game, antelope, elk, black tailed deer, bear, grouse, sage hens, with an abundance of fish in the lakes and rivulets. In the summer it is a perfect paradise for sportsmen, and so healthful that a dyspeptic could not die if he would, unless he should resort to medicine. Here Nature heals the sick and works miracles, and is too benevolent to charge a fee for it.
</p><p>
Lake Como, which lies near the road and in
full view, is a beautiful sheet of water, nearly two miles long by one wide, and contains five or six excellent varieties of fish. It is also a favorite locality for ducks. At Carbon Station, a little west from here, was discovered the first mineral coal found on the line of the Pacific Union Road. The coal is abundant and of excellent quality, and is now mined and shipped to eastern towns in large quantities. Coal mines of equal value have since been discovered at different points along the road, some of which are now worked with remunerating success.
</p><p>
At Bitter Creek, you reach a locality which has been made famous in the annals of the early emigrants. The water is so strongly impregnated with alkali, that neither man nor beast can drink it with safety. The banks of the creek are marshy and dangerous of approach, with evidences of coal oil floating on the surface. The whitened bones of horses and cattle and of man, that are still to be seen along this valley, sufficiently indicate the route pursued in former years by emigrants and freighters. They often arrived here, overcome with thirst; drank from necessity and died. After leaving the valley of this modern Merah, we soon glided into the valley of Green River. Much of the way the bluffs are bold and precipitous. Not far away, on the Sweetwater
</p><p>
River, gold mines have been discovered, which are said to be rich, and which are now worked with considerable success. And now as we proceed, the hills and bluffs often approach within a few rods of the track, presenting a perpendicular front of naked wall, composed of sandstone, and laid up in range-work, like solid masonry. These walls are in some instances hundreds of feet high, and look as if built in the days when there were "giants on the earth." The Church Buttes are so called, because they resemble churches. They are simply earth elevations, having a church-like outline, larger than hills, yet smaller than mountains, which have arisen, without regard to order, out of the surface of an extensive plain. On first view they surprise the beholder and rivet his attention like a passing panorama of wonders. The moss-agates, which are so prized when polished and wrought into jewels for the ear, breast, and fingers, abound here, and along the whole line of the road from Green River to Piedmont. They are found lying loose on the top of the bluffs, and within the crevices of the rocks where the winds have blown away the sand. They are probably the result of volcanic or electrical heat, and were originally formed in the sandstone rocks, where they still lie embedded in large numbers. How this could have occurred and the
agates still retain the imprint of mosses of the most delicate texture, is a marvel. We purchased a few specimens from pedlers who offer them for sale on the cars as well as at the stations.
</p><p>
Many of the stations take their names from some novel circumstance, or historical fact. We passed one called "Lone Tree." The tree that stands there is the only one to be seen in that region. Bridger Station takes its name from one James Bridger, who was a famous hunter in these parts, some forty years ago. Fort Bridger, not far from here, is still more famous as the military post or locality where the Mormons, led by Orson Pratt, on the 23d of November, 1857, in the night, and amid a driving snow storm, attacked and robbed the supply train on its way to the western army, commanded by General Johnson. The train had encamped for the night, and consisted of one hundred and sixty wagons, and a party of two hundred and thirty persons. The Mormons seized the supplies, and burned the wagons, and left the party to starve and die in the wilderness, a thousand miles away from the border settlements. Only eight of the party survived the winter, and they did not reach home until the next June. The Mormons feasted on the supplies in the meantime, while Johnson's army were put on short rations. For this
merciless outrage the Government has never punished the Mormons, or taken official action in reference to it. Though mercy be a divine attribute, the exhibition of too much of it, as in this case, becomes not only a moral, but a political evil.

The Wahsatch Mountains are not generally large, but form a range of irregular, broken hills and peaks with bald heads, and intervening gorges, deep, dark, and sometimes fearful. It is here a desolate, silent, voiceless region of country, and like much of the country through which we have passed, produces little else than sage-brush and grease wood. In passing along Echo canyon we plunged into the bowels of one of the mountains, running through a tunnel seven hundred and seventy feet, the longest on the Pacific Union Road, and emerging into a beautiful vale, as green, fresh, and flowery as Eden. This vale is one of Nature's favorite retreats, a garden hidden away among these desolate mountains. Here she has watered the soil with perennial rills, and cultivated its flowers with a woman's hand.
</p><p>
Near this, we passed what is called the Castle Rocks, which overhang the railway, and tower into the sky from five hundred to two thousand feet. It is impossible to describe the beauties, wonders, and sublimities of the scene. At
one point, a thousand feet above the bed of the canyon which is narrowed here to a mere pathway, the Mormons in 1857, built a fortification and placed on the rim of the precipice a long line of huge stones with a view to crush Johnson's army when it should attempt to pass, by rolling the stones down on his soldiers. But for some reason they did not carry into execution this murderous scheme.
</p><p>
In proceeding along the river down Weber canyon, one becomes convinced that Nature graded the route with the expectation that a railway would be built here some day. By the application of some tremendous force, perhaps with nitro-glycerine, she split open the mountain range for miles, leaving the side walls just wide enough apart to admit of a free and easy passage; and to make it plain, penciled the track with Weber River. No human engineer could mistake the design, or accomplish such a work. On the bank of the river stands a tree of much interest to travelers, the solitary pine, labeled "1000 miles from Omaha," and near it you pass the "devil's slide," a narrow path down an abrupt declivity with a fence twenty feet high on each side, constructed by Nature of huge flagging stone set edgewise in the ground. The slide descends in a straight line, and is more than a thousand feet
long. However slippery the descent, it is evident the devil's sled cannot fly the track. Whether he draws his sled back or slides back, I cannot say, but everybody knows he is a backslider. Very good men in the church sometimes accuse each other of the same sin. A little westward from this slide comes the "devil's gate," a fearful pass between two perpendicular rocks or gate posts, more than a thousand feet high. The gate is supposed to have been demolished when his Satanic Majesty with undue haste and violence, threw it wide open to let the Mormons pass into Salt Lake Valley. In five minutes after emerging from Weber canyon, we reached Uintah, the first station in the holy land of many wives. From here we go by stage to Salt Lake City. The distance is thirty miles.
