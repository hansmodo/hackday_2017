<p><i>[Biographer's note:
About the first week of November we all went by canal-boat to Bremo,
some twenty-five miles up the James River, where we remained the
guests of Doctor and Mrs. Charles Cocke until we went to Lexington.
My sister Agnes, while there, was invited to Richmond to assist at
the wedding of a very dear friend, Miss Sally Warwick.  She wrote
my father asking his advice and approval, and received this reply,
so characteristic of his playful, humorous mood:]</i>

My Precious Little Agnes:  I have just received your letter of the
13th and hasten to reply.  It is very hard for you to apply to me to
advise you to go away from me.  You know how much I want to see you,
and how important you are to me.  But in order to help you to make
up your mind, if it will promote your pleasure and Sally's happiness,
I will say go.  You may inform Sally from me, however, that no
preparations are necessary, and if they were no one could help her.
She has just got to wade through it as if it was an attack of measles
or anything else--naturally.  As she would not marry Custis, she may
marry whom she chooses.  I shall wish her every happiness, just the
same, for she knows nobody loves her as much as I do.  I do not think,
upon reflection, she will consider it right to refuse my son and take
away my daughter.  She need not tell me whom she is going to marry.
I suppose it is some cross old widower, with a dozen children.  She
will not be satisfied at her sacrifice with less, and I should think
that would be cross sufficient.  I hope 'Life' is not going to desert
us too, and when are we to see you?...  I have received your mother's
letter announcing her arrival at 'Bremo.'...  Tell your mother, however,
to come when she chooses and when most to her comfort and convenience.
She can come to the hotel where I am, and stay until the house is ready.
There is no difficulty in that, and she can be very comfortable.  My
rooms are up on the 3d floor and her meals can be sent to her.  Tell
Rob the chills will soon leave him now.  Mrs. Cocke will cure him.
Give much love to your mamma, Mildred, Rob, and all at 'Bremo.'
</p><p>
                  Your affectionate father,
</p><p>
