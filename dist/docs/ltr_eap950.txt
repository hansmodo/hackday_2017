My Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>:--Your last letter speaks of prolonging your stay another year. That was not cheering news. However, I shall still keep hoping that it may be sooner than I expect. I know that time passes rapidly away and I know that you must feel that it will be greatly to your advantage to remain, so I must not complain, for if you continue satisfied, that is worth more than all the gold in California. I am glad you got enough of mining so soon, for a comfortable place to sleep is far preferable to the damp ground.
</p><p>
It seems to me that every letter that I receive from you increases my love and makes me feel that the happiest day I ever knew will be when we meet again. You have asked me to advise you, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>, about returning home. You know I would be overjoyed to see you. At the same time, after having gone so far as you have, and suffering the hardships you did to get there, I certainly would give it a fair trial. I think if you will act according to your own judgment, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>, all will come out right.

I have glad news to tell you. Theodore has arrived safely home. He left San Francisco the 28th of
September. He went from there to Chagres. When he arrived at Chagres, he was taken with the brain fever six hours after he landed, and lay there eight days with it. The doctor charged him two dollars a powder and the woman where he boarded charged him two dollars for a cup of tea. He felt weak and had no appetite. He then took the Pacific and went to Havana where he took passage on the Ohio, which landed him at Norfolk. When aboard the Ohio, it came nearly being lost in a dreadful gale. The water rose eight feet in the vessel and put out the fires. The passengers were obliged to work the pumps for two days and nights. When Theodore could work the pumps no longer, he lay down on deck in the water and caught a heavy cold. The vessel, instead of going to New York, had to put in at Norfolk. When he reached Philadelphia, which was the 29th of December, he went right to sister's. She at once went out and bought him a suit of comfortable clothes and sent for the doctor. He had a bad chill before the doctor came. The doctor examined him and said his liver and throat were affected. He forbid him talking, and put him on a low diet. Theodore brought nearly three hundred dollars in gold dust. That is all he has to show for two years' lost time. His accounts of the living and hardships at the mines are distressing yet laughable to hear. He seems to be perfectly satisfied with Chester County.

Mr. Dixon died on the 5th of September. Theodore nursed him until he died, and gave him as decent a burial as any person could have given him out there. Mrs. Dixon does not seem to mind her husband's death at all. She is still flying around.

My dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>, when you start home take the
quickest route, for I shall be so worried from the time you start until you arrive home.

Bayard Taylor was soon left a widower after he came home from his tour. He married a Miss Agnew of Hennet and now she is dead and buried. She was very ill when she was married.

I took that gold dust you sent me to the jeweller and had a little more put into it and had a very pretty plain ring made of it. I kept the gold dust in a bottle for it was loose and I would soon have lost it, otherwise. I prize your daguerreotype and that ring more than anything I have in my possession.
</p><p>
I remain yours most sincerely and devoutly,
</p><p>
