Dear Brother : . . . Gradually the practice has come 
into my original proposition that none but discharged 
soldiers should go home, or wounded men. All others 
should be in regimental hospitals, or hospitals established near at hand where as they convalesce they can 
join. Although from the President down to the lowest 
Brigadier orders to this effect have been issued, yet there 
are hundreds trying to get their brothers and sons home. 
I know full well the intense desire to get home, but any 
army would be ruined by this cause alone. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gbm" rel="colleague met">McClellan</a> 
has 70,000 absent from his army. Some were sick, but 
certainly not over 20,000 ; with the other 50,000 our country might have been saved the disgrace of a retreat from 
Richmond, for it has resolved itself into that. At last 
all have come to the conclusion that we are at war, and 
great as the draft has been on your population, don't suppose you outnumber the South yet. All their people are 
armed and at war. You hear of vast armies at Richmond, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chattanooga" rel="city">Chattanooga</a> and threatening <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a>, 
whilst the whole country is full of guerilla bands numbering hundreds. All the people are armed. fA year ago 
we could have taken them unprepared, but they have used 
the year to buy all kinds of arms and munitions of war and 
wherever we go we find them well prepared. They seem 
to have left this quarter. I am glad of the new levies 
and only regret the loss of the year. The present operations in Virginia and Kentucky are all important. . . .

Affectionately,
