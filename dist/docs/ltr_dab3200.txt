DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your favor of the 18th ultimo. 
The honorable notice you have been pleased to take 
of my little expedition, fills my mind with the warmest gratitude, and I hope to merit your future esteem. 
</p><p>
It is some time since I inclosed to the honorable 
Board of War a return of the troops under my command, and of the articles of clothing necessary for the 
respective corps, to render them tolerably comfortable 
during the ensuing winter. The troops have received a small supply of money, and I expect they will 
be contented, until more can be procured from the 
treasury. 
</p><p>
An expedition against Detroit, in the winter season, 
will doubtless put us in possession of the enemy's 
shipping, and, of course, give us the command of 
Lake Erie. Winter expeditions are generally attended 
with great loss of horses and cattle, except where 
large magazines of forage are laid in, and can be 
transported. But the British garrison and shipping 
will be a full compensation for every loss of that 
kind, and, indeed, every difficulty we can meet in the 
obtaining it, as it will likewise secure the future 
tranquillity of this frontier. 
</p><p>
I will endeavour to, have every thing in perfect readiness, and procure the best intelligence that circumstances will admit. I believe a considerable number 
of Indians will join me ; but I have little expectation 
of supplies, except from the French settlement in the 
vicinity of that post ; and, as the British yearly cause 
the inhabitants to thresh out the grain, and sell to 
them for the purpose of filling their magazines, little 
dependence can be placed on receiving supplies from 
them ; and the Indians, on the Biver St. Lawrence, 
subsist chiefly on animal food. I have frequently 
applied to the Board of War for supplies and trinkets 
for the Indians, but fear it is not in their power to 
procure them. I will, however, renew my application. 
It is with great pleasure I hear of the destination 
of his Excellency <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count D Estaing</a>, and I have a happy 
presage that he will have the most ample success. 
</p><p>
I herewith remit a return of the cannon and military stores belonging to these garrisons, and an estimate of the cannon and military stores necessary for 
the intended expedition, to the best of my judgment. 
My best intelligence, at present, is, that the enemy 
have erected a very strong work, near to the old fort, 
and on the only commanding eminence, behind the 
soldiers gardens ; that the garrison consists of three hundred regulars (some say more), and about the 
same number of militia ; some of the latter description, 
it is said, will join our troops on their arrival in that 
neighbourhood. The Wyandots, Tawas, Chippewas, and 
Pottawattomies, live in the vicinity of Detroit, and 
many of them are, without doubt, under British influence. 
</p><p>
If the expedition cannot be prosecuted before the month of February, it will then be too late, on ac 
count of the high floods to which the intermediate 
country is subjected. Should it prove impracticable 
to carry on the expedition against Detroit, the troops 
under my command, with some volunteers, in my 
opinion, might be advantageously employed on an expedition against the Shawanese, on the Miami River, 
and from thence against the enemy's post at Natchez, 
with very little or no additional expense, and return 
early in the spring to march against Detroit. For I 
apprehend no danger to this frontier during the winter season, and the troops will be healthier, if continued in action, than in these garrisons. 
</p><p>
A couple of French gentlemen, of good address, 
would be very serviceable in this district, and especially on an expedition. I shall be happy to hear from you, and receive further instructions. I have 
the honor to be, with the highest sentiments of respect and esteem, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>

P. S. I am this moment informed that two thou 
sand Indians, who were driven from their towns, are 
in great distress, and live on the pittance afforded 
them by the enemy at Niagara. This intelligence 
is from Sandusky, and may be relied on. They in 
form the other Indians that they are afraid to hunt, 
on account of the Americans.
