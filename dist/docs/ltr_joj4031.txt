Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I should have much wondered what could have detained 
my letter, mentioned in yours of 20th September last, so 
long from you, had not my correspondence been strangely 
interrupted ever since my arrival. 
</p><p>
Your Constitution gives me much satisfaction. It appears to me to be, upon the whole, wisely formed and well 
digested. I find that it describes your State as being in 
New-England, as well as in America. Perhaps it would 
be better if these distinctions were permitted to die away. 
</p><p>
Your predictions respecting the fate of Lord Cornwallis have, thank God! been verified. It is a glorious, joyful, 
and important event. Britain feels the force of that stroke, and other nations berrin to doubt less of the continuance of 
our independence. Further successes must prepare the 
way for peace; and I hope that victory will stimulate, 
instead of relaxing our exertions. 
</p><p>
Although myself and my family have most severely suffered by the continental money, I am resigned to its fate. 
Provided we preserve our liberty and independence, I shall 
be content. Under their auspices, in a fruitful country, and 
by patient industry, a competence may always be acquired, 
and I shall never cease to prefer a little with freedom, to 
opulence without it. 
</p><p>
Your account of the plenty which abounds in our country 
is very flattering, and ought to excite our gratitude to the 
Hand that gives it. While our governments tax wisely, 
reward merit, and punish offenders, we shall have little to 
fear. The public has been too much a prey to peculation. 
Economy and strict accounts ought to be, and continue, 
among the first objects of our attention. 
</p><p>
I have not heard any thing for a long time respecting 
our disputed lines. In my opinion, few things demand more 
immediate care than this subject; and I differ from those 
who think that such matters had better be postponed till 
after the war. At present, a sense of common danger 
guaranties our union. We have neither time nor inclination to dispute among ourselves. Peace will give us leisure, and leisure often finds improper occasions for employment. I most sincerely wish that no disputes may survive 
the war ; and that on the return of peace, we may congratulate each other on our deliverance and prospects of 
uninterrupted felicity, without finding ourselves exposed to 
differences and litigations, which never fail to make impressions injurious to that cordiality and confidence which both 
our interest and our duty call upon us to cultivate and 
,eherish. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Jay charges me to present her compliments to you. 
I am, dear sir, with great and sincere esteem, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
