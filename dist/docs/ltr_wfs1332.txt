HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tacubaya" rel="city">TACUBAYA</a>, AT THE GATES OF MEXICO, August 28, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>. 
<p></p>
Sir: 
<p></p>
My report, No. 31, commenced in the night of the 
19th instant, closed with the operations of the army on 
that day. 
<p></p>
The morning of the 20th opened with one of a series 
of unsurpassed achievements, all in view of the capital, 
and to which I shall give the general name Battles of 
Mexico. 
<p></p>
In the night of the 19th, Brigadier-Generals Shields, 
P. F. Smith, and Cadwallader, and Colonel Riley, with 
their brigades, and the 15th Regiment, under Colonel 
Morgan, detached from Brigadier - General Pierce 
found themselves in and about the important position 
the village, hamlet or hacienda, called indifferently, 
Contreras, Ansalda, San Geronimo half a mile nearer 
to the city than the enemy's intrenched camp, on the 
same road, toward the factory of Magdalena. 
<p></p>
That camp had been, unexpectedly, our formidable 
point of attack in the afternoon before, and we had 
now to take it, without the aid of cavalry or artillery, 
or to throw back our advanced corps upon the direct 
road from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san augustin" rel="city">SAN AUGUSTIN</a> to the city, and thence force a 
passage through <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san antonio" rel="city">San Antonio</a>. 
<p></p>
Accordingly, to meet contingencies, Major-General 
Worth was ordered to leave early in the morning of 
the 20th, one of his brigades to mask <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san antonio" rel="city">San Antonio</a>, and 
to march with the other six miles, via <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san augustin" rel="city">SAN AUGUSTIN</a> upon Contreras. A like destination was given to 
Major-General Quitman and his remaining brigade in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san augustin" rel="city">SAN AUGUSTIN</a> replacing, for the moment, the garrison 
of that important depot with -Hartley s brigade of cavalry, as horse could not pass over the intervening lava, 
etc., to reach the field of battle. 
<p></p>
A diversion for an earlier hour (daylight) had been 
arranged the night before, according to the suggestion 
of Brigadier-General P. F. Smith, received through the 
Engineer, Captain Lee, who conveyed my orders to our 
troops remaining on the ground, opposite to the enemy's 
centre the point for the diversion or a real attack, as 
circumstances might allow. 
<p></p>
Guided by Captain Lee, it proved the latter, under 
the command of Colonel Ransom of the 9th, having 
with him that regiment and some companies of three 
others the 3d, 12th, and Rifles. 
<p></p>
Shields, the senior officer at the hamlet, having 
arrived in the night, after Smith had arranged with 
Cadwallader and Riley the plan of attack for the morning, delicately waived interference; but reserved to 
himself the double task of holding the hamlet with his 
two regiments (South Carolina and New York Volunteers) against ten times his numbers on the side of the 
city, including the slopes to his left, and in case the 
enemy's camp in his rear should be carried, to face 
about and cut off the flying enemy. 
<p></p>
At three o clock A. M. the great movement com 
menced on the rear of the enemy's camp, Riley leading, followed successively by Cadwallader's and Smith's 
brigades, the latter temporarily under the orders of 
Major Dimick of the 1st Artillery the whole force 
being commanded by Smith, the senior in the general 
attack, and whose arrangements, skill, and gallantry 
always challenge the highest admiration. 
<p></p>
The march was rendered tedious by the darkness, 
rain, and mud ; but about sunrise, Riley, conducted by 
Lieutenant Tower, Engineer, had reached an elevation 
behind the enemy, whence he precipitated his columns ; 
stormed the intrenchments, planted his several colors 
upon them, and carried the work all in seventeen 
minutes. 
<p></p>
Conducted by Lieutenant Beauregard, Engineer, 
and Lieutenant Brooks of Twiggs's Staff both of 
whom, like Lieutenant Tower, had, in the night, twice 
reconnoitred the ground Cadwallader brought up to 
the general assault, two of his regiments the Yoltigeurs and the llth ; and at the appointed time Colonel Eansom, with his temporary brigade, conducted by 
Captain Lee, Engineer, not only made the movement 
in front, to divert and to distract the enemy, but, after 
crossing the deep ravine, advanced, and poured into 
the works and upon the fugitives many volleys from 
his destructive musketry. 
<p></p>
In the mean time Smith's own brigade, under the 
temporary command of Major Dimick, following the 
movements of Riley and Cadwallader, discovered, opposite to, and outside of the works, a long line of Mexican 
cavalry, drawn up as a support. Dimick having at the 
head of the brigade the company of Sappers and Miners, 
under Lieutenant G. W. Smith, Engineer, who had conducted the march, was ordered by Brigadier-General 
Smith to form his line faced to the enemy, and in a 
charge, against a flank, routed the cavalry. 
<p></p>
Shields, too, by the wise disposition of his brigade 
and gallant activity, contributed much to the general 
results. He held masses of cavalry and infantry, supported by artillery, in check below him, and captured 
hundreds, with one general (Mendoza), of those who fled 
from above. 
<p></p>
I doubt whether a more brilliant or decisive victory 
taking into view ground, artificial defences, batteries, 
and the extreme disparity of numbers without cavalry 
or artillery on our side is to be found on record. In 
cluding all our corps directed against the intrenched 
camp, with Shields s brigade at the hamlet, we positively did not number over four thousand five hundred 
rank and file ; and we knew by sight, and since, more 
certainly, by many captured documents and letters, 
that the enemy had actually engaged on the spot seven 
thousand men, with at least twelve thousand more hovering within sight and striking distance both on the 
19th and 20th. All, not Mlled or captured, now fled 
with precipitation. 
<p></p>
Thus was the great victory of Contreras achieved ; 
one road to the capital opened ; seven hundred of the 
enemy killed; eight hundred and thirteen prisoners, 
including, among eighty-eight officers, four generals ; 
besides many colors and standards ; twenty-two pieces 
of brass ordnance half of large calibre; thousands of 
small arms and accoutrements; an immense quantity 
of shot, shells, powder, and cartridges ; seven hundred 
pack mules, many horses, etc., etc. all in our hands. 
<p></p>
It is highly gratifying to find that, by skilful arrangement and rapidity of execution, our loss, in killed 
and wounded, did not exceed, on the spot, sixty 
among the former the brave Captain Charles Hanson, 
of the 4th Infantry not more distinguished for gallantry than for modesty, morals, and piety. Lieuten 
ant J. P. Johnstone, 1st Artillery, serving with Magruder's battery, a young officer of the highest promise, 
was killed the evening before. 
<p></p>
One of the most pleasing incidents of the recapture, in their works, by Captain Drum, Artillery, under Major Gardner, of the two brass 6- 
pounders, taken from another company of the same 
regiment, though without the loss of honor, at the 
glorious battle of Buena Yista about which guns the 
whole regiment had mourned for so many long months ! 
Coming up a little later I had the happiness to join in 
the protracted cheers of the gallant 4th on the joyous 
event ; and, indeed, the whole army sympathizes in its 
just pride and exultation. 
<p></p>
The battle being won before the advancing brigades 
of Worth's and Quitman's divisions were in sight, both 
were ordered back to their late positions : Worth, to 
attack <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san antonio" rel="city">San Antonio</a>, in front, with his whole force, as 
soon as approached in the rear by Pillow's and Twiggs's 
divisions moving from Contreras, through San Angel 
and Coyoacan. By carrying <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san antonio" rel="city">San Antonio</a>, we knew 
that we should open another a shorter and better road 
to the capital for our siege and other trains. 
<p></p>
Accordingly, the two advanced divisions and Shields 
brigade marched from Contreras, under the immediate 
orders of Major-General Pillow, w r ho was now joined 
by the gallant Brigadier-General Pierce of his division, 
personally thrown out of activity, late the evening be 
fore, by a severe hurt received from the fall of his 
horse. 
<p></p>
After giving necessary orders on the field, in the 
midst of prisoners and trophies, and sending instructions to Harney's brigade of cavalry (left at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san augustin" rel="city">SAN AUGUSTIN</a>) to join me, I personally followed Pillow's command. 
<p></p>
Arriving at Coyoacan, two miles by a cross road, 
from the rear of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san antonio" rel="city">San Antonio</a>, I first detached Captain 
Lee, Engineer, with Captain Kearny s troop, 1st Dragoons, supported by the Rifle Regiment, under Major 
Loring, to reconnoitre that strong point; and next 
despatched Major-General Pillow, with one of his 
brigades (Cadwallader's), to make the attack upon it, 
in concert with Major-General Worth on the opposite 
side. 
<p></p>
At the same time, by another road to the left, 
Lieutenant Stevens of the Engineers, supported by 
Lieutenant G. "W. Smith's company of sappers and 
miners, of the same corps, was sent to reconnoitre tho strongly fortified church or convent of San Pablo, in 
the hamlet of Churubusco one mile off. Twiggs with 
one of his brigades (Smith's less the Rifles) and Cap- 
tain Taylor's field battery, were ordered to follow and 
to attack the convent. Major Smith, senior Engineer, 
was despatched to concert with Twiggs the mode and 
means of attack, and Twiggs's other brigade (Biley's) 
I soon ordered up to support him. 
<p></p>
Next (but all in ten minutes) I sent Pierce (just 
able to keep the saddle) with his brigade (Pillow's 
division), conducted by Captain Lee, Engineer, by a 
third road a little farther to our left, to attack the enemy's right and rear, in order to favor the movement 
upon the convent, and to cut off a retreat toward the 
capital. And finally, Shields, senior brigadier to 
Pierce, with the !N"ew York and South Carolina Volunteers (Quitman's division), was ordered to follow Pierce 
closely, and to take the command of our left wing 
All these movements were made with the utmost alacrity by our gallant troops and commanders. 
<p></p>
Finding myself at Coyoacan, from which so many 
roads conveniently branched, without escort or reserve, 
I had to advance for safety close upon Twiggs's rear. 
The battle now raged from the right to the left of our 
whole line. 
<p></p>
Learning on the return of Captain Lee, that Shields 
in the rear of Churubusco was hard pressed, and in 
danger of being outflanked, if not overwhelmed, by 
greatly superior numbers, I immediately sent under 
Major Sumner, 2d Dragoons, the Rifles (Twiggs's reserve) and Captain Sibley s troop, 2d Dragoons, then at 
hand, to support our left, guided by the same engineer. 
<p></p>
About an hour earlier, Worth had, by skilful and 
daring movements upon the front and right, turned 
and forced <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san antonio" rel="city">San Antonio</a> its garrison, no doubt, much 
shaken by our decisive victory at Contreras. 
<p></p>
His second brigade (Colonel Clarke s) conducted 
by Captain Mason, Engineer, assisted by Lieutenant 
Hardcastle, Topographical Engineer, turned to the 
left, and by a wide sweep came out upon the high 
road to the capital. At this point the heavy garrison 
(three thousand men) in retreat was, by Clarke, cut in 
the centre : one portion, the rear, driven upon Dolores, 
off to the right, and the other upon Churubusco, in the 
direct line of our operations. The first brigade (Colonel Garland's), same division, consisting of the 2d Artillery, under Major Gait, the 3d Artillery, under 
Lieutenant-Colonel Belton, and the 4th Infantry, com 
manded by Major F. Lee, with Lieutenant-Colonel 
Duncan s field battery (temporarily) followed in pursuit through the town, taking one general prisoner, 
the abandoned guns (five pieces), much ammunition, 
and other public property. 
<p></p>
The forcing of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san antonio" rel="city">San Antonio</a> was the second brilliant 
event of the day. 
<p></p>
Worth's division being soon reunited in hot pursuit, 
he was joined by Major-General Pillow, who, marching from Coyoacan and discovering that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san antonio" rel="city">San Antonio</a> 
had been carried, immediately turned to the left according to my instructions, and, though much impeded 
by ditches and swamps, hastened to the attack of 
Churubusco. 
<p></p>
The hamlet or scattered houses bearing this name, 
presented besides the fortified convent, a strong fieldwork (fete de pont) with regular bastions and curtains 
at the head of a bridge over which the road passes 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san antonio" rel="city">San Antonio</a> to the capital. 
<p></p>
The whole remaining forces of Mexico some twenty-seven thousand men cavalry, artillery, and infantry, collected from every quarter were now in, on the 
flanks, or within supporting distance of those works, 
and seemed resolved to make a last and desperate 
stand ; for if beaten here, the feebler defences at the 
gates of the city four miles off could not, as was well 
known to both parties, delay the victors an hour. [?] 
<p></p>
The capital of an ancient empire, now of a great 
republic ; or an early peace, the assailants were resolved 
to win. Not an American and we were less than a third 
of the enemy's numbers had a doubt as to the result. 
<p></p>
The fortified church or convent, hotly pressed by 
Twiggs, had already held out about an hour, when 
Worth and Pillow the latter having with him Cadwallader's brigade began to manoeuvre closely upon 
the tete de pont with the convent at half gunshot to 
their left. Garland s brigade (Worth's division), to 
which had been added the light battalion under 
Lieutenant-Colonel C. F. Smith, continued to advance 
in front and under the fire of a long line of infantry off 
on the left of the bridge ; and Clarke of the same division, directed his brigade along the road or close by 
its side. Two of Pillow's and Cadwallader's regiments, 
the llth and 14th, supported and participated in this 
direct movement : the other (the voltigeurs) was left 
in reserve. Most of these corps particularly Clarke's 
brigade advancing perpendicularly, were made to 
suffer much by the fire of the tete de pont, and they 
would have suffered greatly more by flank attacks from 
the convent, but for the pressure of Twiggs on the 
other side of that work. 
<p></p>
This well-combined and daring movement at length 
reached the principal point of attack, and the formida 
ble tete de pout was at once assaulted and carried by 
the bayonet. Its deep wet ditch was first gallantly 
crossed by the 8th and 5th Infantry, commanded re 
spectively by Major Waite and Lieutenant-Colonel 
Martin Scott followed closely by the 6th Infantry 
(same brigade), which had been so much exposed on 
the road the llth regiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel 
Graham, and the 14th commanded by Colonel Trousdale, both of Cadwallader's brigade, Pillow's division. 
About the same time, the enemy in front of Garland, 
after a hot conflict of an hour and a half gave way, in 
a retreat toward the capital. 
<p></p>
The immediate results of this third signal triumph 
of the day were three field pieces, one hundred and 
ninety-two prisoners, much ammunition and two colors 
taken at the tete depont. 
<p></p>
Lieutenant I. F. Irons, 1st Artillery, aide-de-camp 
to Brigadier-General Cadwallader, a young officer of 
great merit and conspicuous in battle on several previous occasions, received in front of the work, a mortal 
wound. (Since dead.) 
<p></p>
As the concurrent attack upon the convent favored, 
physically and morally, the assault upon the tete de 
pont, so reciprocally, no doubt, the fall of the latter 
contributed to the capture of the former. The two 
works were only some four hundred and fifty yards 
apart ; and as soon .as we were in possession of the 
tete de pont, a captured 4-pounder was turned and 
fired first by Captain Larkin Smith, and next by 
Lieutenant Snelling, both of the 8th Infantry several 
times upon the convent. In the same brief interval, 
Lieutenant-Colonel Duncan (also of Worth's division) 
gallantly brought two of his guns to bear at a short 
range from the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san antonio" rel="city">San Antonio</a> road, upon the principal 
face of the work and on the tower of the church, which 
in the obstinate contest, had been often refilled with 
some of the best sharpshooters of the enemy. 
<p></p>
Finally, twenty minutes after the tete de pont had 
been carried by "Worth and Pillow, and at the end of 
a desperate conflict of two hours and a half, the church 
or convent the citadel of the strong line of defence 
along the rivulet of Churubusco yielded to Twiggs's 
division, and threw out on all sides signals of surren 
der. The white flags, however, were not exhibited 
until the moment when the 3d infantry, under Captain 
Alexander, had cleared the way by fire and bayonet, 
and had entered the work. Captain I. M. Smith and 
Lieutenant O. L. Shepherd, both of that regiment, with 
their companies, had the glory of leading the assault. 
The former received the surrender, and Captain Alex 
ander instantly hung out from the balcony the colors 
of the gallant 3d. Major Dimick with a part of the 
1st Artillery, serving as infantry, entered nearly 
abreast with the leading troops. 
<p></p>
Captain Taylor's field battery, attached to Twiggs's 
division, opened its effective fire at an early moment 
upon the outworks of the convent and the tower of its 
church. Exposed to the severest fire of the enemy, 
the captain, his officers and men, won universal admiration ; but at length much disabled in men and 
horses, the battery was by superior orders withdrawn 
from the action, thirty minutes before the surrender 
of the convent. 
<p></p>
Those corps, excepting Taylor's battery, belonged 
to the brigade of Brigadier-General P. F. Smith, who 
closely directed the whole attack in front with his 
habitual coolness and ability ; while Riley's brigade 
the 3d and Yth Infantry, under Captain T. Morris and 
Lieutenent-Colonel Plympton respectively vigorously 
engaged the right of the work and part of its rear. 
<p></p>
At the moment the Rifles, belonging to Smith's, were 
detached in support of Brigadier-General Shields's 
on our extreme left, and the 4th Artillery, acting as 
infantry, under Major Gardner, belonging to Riley's 
brigade, had been left in charge of the camp, trophies, 
etc., at Contreras. Twiggs's division at Churubusco 
had thus been deprived of the services of two of its 
most gallant and effective regiments. 
<p></p>
The immediate results of this victory were : the 
capture of seven field pieces, some ammunition, one 
color, three generals, and one thousand two hundred 
and sixty-one prisoners, including other officers. 
<p></p>
Captains E. A. Capron and M. I. Burke, and Lieutenant S. Hoffman, all of the 1st Artillery, and Captain 
J. W. Anderson and Lieutenant Thomas Easley, both 
of the 2d Infantry five officers of great merit fell 
gallantly before this work. 
<p></p>
The capture of the enemy's citadel was the fourth 
great achievement of our arms in the same day. 
<p></p>
It has been stated that some two hours and a half 
before, Pierce's, followed closely by the volunteer brigade 
both under the command of Brigadier-General Shields 
had been despatched to our left to turn the enemy's 
works ; to prevent the escape of the garrisons and to 
oppose the extension of the enemy's numerous corps 
from the rear upon and around our left. 
<p></p>
Considering the inferior numbers of the two brigades, the objects of the movement were difficult to 
accomplish. Hence the reinforcement (the Rifles, etc.) 
sent forward a little later. 
<p></p>
In a winding march of a mile around to the right, 
this temporary division found itself on the edge of an 
open wet meadow, near the road from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san antonio" rel="city">San Antonio</a> to 
the capital, and in the presence of some four thousand 
of the enemy's infantry, a little in rear of Churubusco, 
on that road. Establishing the right at a strong build 
ing, Shields extended his left parallel to the road, to 
outflank the enemy toward the capital. But the enemy extending his right supported by three thousand 
cavalry more rapidly (being favored by better ground), 
in the same direction, Shields concentrated the division 
about a hamlet and determined to attack in front. 
The battle was long, hot and varied ; but ultimately, 
success crowned the zeal and gallantry of our troops, 
ably directed by their distinguished commander, Brigadier-General Shields. The 9th, 12th, and 15th Regi 
ments, under Colonel Eansom, Captain "Wood, and 
Colonel Morgan respectively, of Pierce's brigade (Pillow's division), and the JSTew York and South Carolina Volunteers, under Colonels Burnett and Butler, 
respectively, of Shields s own brigade (Quitman s 
division), together with the mountain howitzer battery, 
now under Lieutenant Reno of the Ordnance Corps, 
all shared in the glory of this action our fifth victory 
in the same day. 
<p></p>
Brigadier-General Pierce, from the hurt of the even 
ing before under pain and exhaustion fainted in the 
action. Several other changes in command occurred 
on this field. Thus Colonel Morgan being severely 
wounded, the command of the 15th Infantry devolved 
on Lieutenant-Colonel Howard ; Colonel Burnett receiving a like wonnd, the command of the New York 
Yolunteers fell to Lieutenant-Colonel Baxter ; and, on 
the fall of the lamented Colonel P. M. Butler earlier 
badly wounded, but continuing to lead nobly in the 
hottest part of the battle the command of the South 
Carolina Yolunteers devolved first, on Lieutenant-Colonel Dickinson, who being severely wounded (as 
before in the siege of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a>), the regiment ulti 
mately fell under the orders of Major Gladden. 
<p></p>
Lieutenants David Adams and "W. E. Williams of 
the same corps ; Captain Augustus Quarles and Lieutenant J.B. Goodman of the 15th, and Lieutenant E. 
Chandler, New York Volunteers all gallant officers, 
nobly fell in the same action. 
<p></p>
Shields took three hundred and eighty prisoners, 
including officers ; and it cannot be doubted that the 
rage of the conflict between him and the enemy, just 
in the rear of the tete de pont and the convent, had 
some influence on the surrender of those formidable 
defences. 
<p></p>
As soon as the tete de pont was carried, the greater 
part of Worth's and Pillow's forces passed that bridge in 
rapid pursuit of the flying enemy. These distinguished 
generals, coming up with Brigadier-General Shields, 
now also victorious, the three continued to press upon 
the fugitives to within a mile and a half of the capital. 
Here, Colonel Harney, with a small part of his brigade 
of cavalry, rapidly passed to the front, and charged the 
enemy up to the nearest gate. 
<p></p>
The cavalry charge was headed by Captain Kearny, 
of the 1st Dragoons, having in squadron with his own 
troop, that of Captain McBeynolds of the 3d making the 
usual escort to general headquarters ; but, being early 
in the day detached for general service, was now under 
Colonel Harney's orders. The gallant captain not 
hearing the recall, that had been sounded, dashed up to 
the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san antonio" rel="city">San Antonio</a> gate, sabring in his way all who 
resisted. Of the seven officers of the squadron, Kearny 
lost his left arm ; McReynolds and Lieutenant Lorimer 
Graham were both severely wounded, and Lieutenant 
K. S. Ewell, who succeeded to the command of the 
escort, had two horses killed under him. Major F. D. 
Mills, of the 15th infantry, a volunteer in this charge, 
was killed at the gate. 
<p></p>
So terminated the series of events which I have but 
feebly presented. My thanks were freely poured out 
on the different fields to the abilities and science of 
generals and other officers to the zeal and prowess of 
all the rank and file included. But a reward in 
finitely higher the applause of a grateful country and 
Government will, I cannot doubt, be accorded, in due 
time, to so much merit of every sort, displayed by this 
glorious army, which has now overcome all difficulties 
distance, climate, ground, fortifications, numbers. 
<p></p>
It has in a single day, in many battles, as often 
defeated thirty-two thousand, men ; made about three 
thousand prisoners, including eight generals (two of 
them ex-presidents) and two hundred and five other 
officers ; killed or wounded four thousand of all ranks 
besides entire corps dispersed and dissolved; captured thirty-seven pieces of ordnance more than treb 
ling our siege train and field batteries with a large 
number of small arms, a full supply of ammunition of 
every kind, etc., etc. 
<p></p>
These great results have overwhelmed the enemy. 
Our loss amounts to one thousand and fifty-three 
killed, one hundred and thirty-nine, including sixteen 
officers ; wounded, eight hundred and seventy-six, with 
sixty officers. The greater number of the dead and 
disabled were of the highest worth. Those under treat 
ment, thanks to our very able medical officers, are generally doing well. 
<p></p>
I regret having been obliged, on the 20th, to leave 
Major-General Quitman, an able commander, with a 
part of his division the fine 2d Pennsylvania Volunteers, and the veteran detachment of United States 
Marines at our important depot, San^_Aug3istkL It 
was there that I had placed our sick and wounded; 
the siege , supply, and baggage trains. If these had 
been lost, the army would have been driven almost to 
despair ; and considering the enemy's very great excess 
of numbers, and the many approaches to the depot, it 
might well have become, emphatically, the post of honor. 
<p></p>
After so many victories, we might, with but little 
additional loss, have occupied the capital the same 
evening. [?] But Mr. Trist, commissioner, etc., as 
well as myself, had been admonished by the best 
friends of peace intelligent neutrals and some American residents against precipitation ; lest, by wanton 
ly driving away the government and others dishonored 
we might scatter the elements of peace, excite a spirit 
of national desperation, and thus indefinitely postpone 
the hope of accommodation.* 
<p></p>
Deeply impressed with this danger, and remembering our mission to conquer a peace the army very 
cheerfully sacrificed to patriotism to the great wish 
and want of our country the eclat that would have 
followed an entrance sword in hand into a great 
<p></p>
* There were other reasons such as are alluded to in my report of the 
capture of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a>. If we had proceeded to assault the city by day 
light our loss would have been dangerously great, and if a little later in 
the night, the slain, on the other side, including men, women, and children, 
would have been frightful, because if the assailants stopped to make prisoners before occupying all the strongholds, they would soon become prison 
ers themselves. Other atrocities, by the victors, are, in such cases, inevitable. Pillage always follows, and seems authorized by the usage of war. 
Hence I promised (September 13), at the gates of Mexico, a contribution 
in lieu of pillage, in order tc avoid the horrors in question, and the consequent loss of discipline and e iciency. 
capital. Willing to leave something to this republic 
of no immediate value to us on which to rest her 
pride, and to recover temper I halted our victorious 
corps at the gates of the city (at least for a time), and 
have them now cantoned in the neighboring villages, 
where they are well sheltered and supplied with all 
necessaries. 
<p></p>
On the morning of the 21st, being about to take up 
battering or assaulting positions, to authorize me to 
summon the city to surrender, or to sign an armistice 
with a pledge to enter at once into negotiations for 
peace a mission came out to propose a truce. Rejecting its terms, I despatched my contemplated note to President <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=als" rel="adversary">Santa Anna</> omitting the summons.

ments have been thus happily turned over to their 
plenipotentiaries, who have now had several conferences, and with, I think, some hope of signing a treaty

There will be transmitted to the Adjutant-General 
reports from divisions, brigades, etc., on the foregoing 
operations, to which I must refer, with my hearty concurrence in the just applause bestowed on corps and 
individuals by their respective commanders. I have 
been able this report being necessarily a summary 
to bring out, comparatively, but little of individual 
merit not lying directly in the way of the narrative. 
Thus I doubt whether I have, in express terms, given 
my approbation and applause to the commanders of 
divisions and independent brigades ; but left their fame

deeds and the brilliant results.

Flores, to make contingent arrangements for shots and shells we having 
brought up but few of either, from the want of road power returning, 
fell into an ambuscade, and though he cut his way through, was, while 
slaying one man hi his front, pierced through the body with a lance, by 
another, and thus thrown hors de combat for the remainder of the campaign. In <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1861">1861</a>, he, as a private, was in one of the first regiments of vol
