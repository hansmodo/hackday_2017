Dear General, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter, dated the 27th of March 
last, came safe to hand, and I have the honor to assure you that I will observe the contents of it with 
all the care and attention in my power. The part I 
took in the business I had the honor to inform you 
of, has deprived me of the confidence of all those 
gentlemen concerned. It is however scarcely possible, that a matter of that extensive importance can 
be conducted to any dangerous crisis, without my discovering something of it, time enough to give you 
the necessary information. In the mean time, my vigilance shall not sleep. 
</p><p>
Should your Excellency find it necessary to honor 
me with your commands, they will find a safe conveyance by being sent under cover to my son, John 
Marshall, in Richmond, to whom I shall write for 
that purpose. 
</p><p>
Permit me. Sir, to express my extreme happiness 
on account of your Excellency's acceptance of the 
Presidency of the United States ; an event the more 
to be rejoiced at, as it bids fair, at this critical time, 
for the reconcilement of all parties. It strongly impresses on my mind the truth of what w^as prophetically said from the pulpit, on the commencement of 
the former French war, " that <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> had sent 
you into the world to be the salvation of America." 
May God bless and prosper you ! is the prayer of 
him, who has the honor to be, with the most respectful regard, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=tom" rel="me">Thomas Marshall</a>.
