<a rel='month origin' value='4'>April</a> <a rel='day origin' value='15'>15th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=chester' rel='city origin'>CHESTER</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. What a week it has been madness, sadness, anxiety, turmoil, ceaseless excitement. The Wigfalls 
passed through on their way to Texas. We did not see them. Louly told <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> they were bound for the Rio 
Grande, and ir-tended to shake hands with Maximilian, Emperor of Mexico. Yankees were expected here every minute. <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> came. We went down to the cars at day light to receive her. She dined with me. Lovely Winnie, 
the baby, came, too. Buck and <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> were here, and that queen of women, Mary Darby. Clay behaved like a trump. 
He was as devoted to <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> in her adversity as if they had never quarreled in her prosperity. People sent me 
things for <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a>, as they did in Columbia for <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis</a>. It was a luncheon or breakfast only she stayed for 
here. Mrs. Brown prepared a dinner for her at the station. I went down with her. She left here at five o clock. 
My heart was like lead, but we did not give way. She was as calm and smiling as ever. It was but a brief glimpse of 
my dear <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a>, and under altered skies.
