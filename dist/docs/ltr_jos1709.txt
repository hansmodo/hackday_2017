My Dear Brother: We are watching with the most 
eager interest the progress of your expedition. We all 
hope its success will brighten the gloom cast by operations here. If the Mississippi can only be opened and 
Texas and Arkansas detached it will be a gleam of hope 
by which I can see the end of the war. Without an outlet to the South and West and with such a blockade as 
we can easily keep up, the Southern Confederacy cannot 
exist. This will settle the cotton question, for Texas 
and Arkansas can with the free labor that can easily be 
thrown there grow enough cotton for the world another ground of hope. Banks and yourself I regard as 
the best officers we have. . . . 
</p><p>
I have always believed in you even when you were 
under a cloud. If you and Banks can act harmoniously 
and actively together you are able to do more than any 
two men in the continent. 
</p><p>
By the way, Banks is a reserved man, not from pride 
or over self-confidence, but from the defects of a limited 
education and from a sensitiveness this unnecessarily 
gives him. The more you know him the better you will 
like him. He and I are warm friends. We became early 
attached in his famous contest for speaker when I first 
entered Congress. Although new in political life, I stuck 
to him when his prospects were dark, and ever since then 
there has been a sincere friendship between us, although 
we have not often met. This feeling I know will warm 
him towards you, and his abilities will excite your respect. I write this in anticipation of your meeting and 
having to co-operate with him. . . . 
</p><p>
This Government has to be maintained and I now 
look to you and Banks as the " men of promise." I do 
not favor the Bankrupt Law as you suppose, and I can't 
conceive how you got that idea unless because I presented petitions. I am occasionally asked for letters to 
you. I generally decline, except where refusal would 
wound a valued friend. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
