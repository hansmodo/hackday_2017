On the way from Sacramento to this city, we saw and learned some things that interested us exceedingly, and perhaps some account of them might interest you. I allude to the vast, but shorn wheat fields, and the method of cultivating wheat. The farms, or ranches, as they call them, through which we passed, are very extensive, consisting, in some instances, of many thousand acres. At this season the entire extent of the country, along the route from Sacramento to this city, looks like a continuous stubble-field, and is dry and dusty. The Sacramento valley is, in fact, the heart of the wheat region. The lands are rich and generally level; but in some parts they become rolling and even hilly. The quality of the wheat grown here excels that of any other part of the world. The flour it makes is the whitest, and the bread the sweetest and most delicate imaginable. The
grain is so hard that it requires a special process to mill it. Some farmers sow a breadth of one thousand to six thousand acres. They plow with a machine, sow with a machine, reap with a machine, thrash and winnow with a machine. The plow, called a "gang-plow" runs on wheels, and holds itself. It has an elevated seat for the teamster, who sits and rides like a gentleman in a sulky. The reaping machine, called a "header," runs ahead of the team that propels it, and clips off the wheat heads with a vibrating knife, letting them fall on a revolving canvas, which deposits them in an attendant wagon. When full, the wagon delivers its contents to a thrashing-machine, which thrashes and winnows the grain, depositing it in heaps, where it remains in the open air, sometimes for weeks, until it can be sacked and delivered at a railroad station for transportation. In a climate so dry as this is, they have no fears of rain for six or seven months in the year, and therefore build but few barns. At different stations, along the Sacramento valley, we saw millions of bushels of wheat in sacks, lying along the track, corded up like fire-word, and extending for miles in a line with the wayside. Its appearance reminded me of the great Chinese wall. A country that fortifies itself with sacked wheat, can never be sacked, or subjugated. The wheat crop
of this year is estimated at twenty millions of bushels.

Here let me stop and take breath for a few minutes. It is refreshing to do so, in the midst of a series of constant surprises. Coming from the East overland to California, is literally stepping into a new world. Everything is new--a chaos of wonders. Before I forget it, allow me to give you, in a few words, my general impressions of the mountain plains and the California valley, or coast, so far as I have already seen them.
</p><p>
In the mountain ranges, with a few exceptions, the face of the country is destitute of timber of every kind; looks like a desert, and is relieved by no green thing, except sage brush. This plant abounds, and in its odor and appearance resembles our garden sage, but grows much larger and stronger, and is as scraggy as the witch of Endor's hair. It has its uses, however, and is gathered, dried and consumed, as fuel, by the pioneers and aborigines. It has a pungent taste and the flavor of sage, and doubtless may possess valuable medicinal qualities.
</p><p>
So in the valleys and plains along the coast range, there is little or no timber to be found. The only trees to be seen in traveling by rail, are the low branching live oaks, an evergreen which looks like an aged apple tree in its shape and size.
</p><p>
These oaks stand scattered over the face of the country in places, or rather in groups, in such a way as to induce you to think them apple orchards. The trunks of the trees are short and gnarled, the tops low and broad; but the timber is of no use, except for fire-wood. They have no fences in this country, and need no fire-wood, except for cooking purposes, so mild is the climate.

We arrived in San Francisco on the 6th inst., early in the evening, crossing the Bay in a steamer. The moment we stepped on the wharf, we were surrounded by an army of noisy and uproarious backmen, who contended with each other manifully for the prizes, or rather for the victims. Every hotel in the city was lauded as the best, and denounced as the worst in town. We knew where we wished to go, and soon escaped from the battlefield in a private hack to a friend's house.
</p><p>
The next day we took a brief survey of our whereabouts, and found ourselves in the heart of a splendid city, only twenty years old, yet looking mature, and destined to become the great central city of the commercial world. It is here that Europe, Asia and America will meet, shake hands, and be good friends. Here they will concentrate their wealth, exchange commodities, gamble in stocks, and test the comparative sharpness of their wits.
</p><p>
In the course of a few days, after our arrival, we began to feel quite at home in the city. The citizens are candid, frank and polite to strangers, and generous to a fault. They are proud of their city, and seem to think there is no other place in the wide world so delightful as California. In this opinion I concur so far as my brief experience extends. The general aspect of the city is peculiar. It looks as if it was constructed of sand-hills and windmills, and in truth it really is. The picture, however, has some other features of a more attractive character. It is a difficult city to describe. In fact, there is very little use in attempting to describe it. If I should attempt, it would outgrow my description before I could finish it.
</p><p>
The city is located on the tip end of a tongue of land, or peninsula, lying between the Bay and the Sea. This peninsula is about forty miles long and ten to twelve broad. The surface is broken into hills and vales, and presents to the eye a scene of great natural beauty, wild and romantic as fairy land. From the north end of the peninsula the city has already extended itself southerly some six miles, and is rapidly advancing. It contains at this time, it is said, one hundred and seventy-five thousand inhabitants. This is a wonderful growth for a city but twenty years old,
especially when we consider the fact that it has been twice almost entirely destroyed by fire. The time will soon come when the city will extend over and densely occupy the whole peninsula. The Bay is amply sufficient in breadth and depth to accommodate the navies of the civilized world, and furnishes a line of dockage that might be improved and extended to the entire distance of forty miles. If I were a land speculator, I would invest in the peninsula, in preference to investing in the richest gold mine as yet known in California. One can hardly miss it, who purchases land anywhere within ten or twenty miles of the city. Nature evidently intended there should be a great city here--the central mart of the commercial world--and has therefore done her part in laying the foundations on a magnificent scale. The San Franciscans, though sagacious and quick in their perceptions, do not yet seem to comprehend the great, the splendid future that lies before them. It may be truthfully said of the Pacific coast, generally, that for climate and productiveness of soil, it excels the world. For beauty of natural scenery and sunny skies, Italy does not compare with it. The air here is so pure and exhilarating, that it makes one feel, who breathes it, as if he were drinking champagne all the time. It not only invigorates the invalid, but rejuvenates old
age, and prolongs life to an indefinite period, so long, indeed, that persons wishing to die at three score and ten, can't. So say the Californians. It is enough, perhaps, to say that it is a wonderful country--a land of fruits and flowers, enriched with mountains of gold. It is the gold that "lends enchantment to the view." Yet this modern paradise has its annoyances. In San Francisco, dense fogs envelop the city till ten o'clock in the morning, and strong winds prevail the rest of the day, drifting the sand into mounds, and into your eyes so as to blind you. Turning the corners of the streets in the wind, reminds you of a drifting snow-storm, in mid-winter, in a New England city. Still, by way of compensation for all this, you have here a cloudless sky for nine months in the year; a climate that is uniformly mild; and a vernal season that flings over the hills and the valleys a mantle of wild flowers, perfuming every breath of air you breathe. And yet, in California, it is gold that makes the man; the want of it, an outcast, or an outlaw. It is said there are at least seven thousand able-bodied men in San Francisco, who cannot find employment, and probably more than twice that number roving about the State, awaiting chances, who are alike destitute of friends and of money; and hence, many of this class, with starvation staring them in the face, resort to
stealing, or highway robbery, in order to live. It is, after all, a poor country for a poor man; but a good country for a man who has capital, nerve, and perseverance.
