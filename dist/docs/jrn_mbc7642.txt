<a rel='month origin' value='6'>June</a> <a rel='day origin' value='6'>6th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. Paul Hayne, the poet, has taken rooms here. My husband came and offered to buy me a pair of horses. 
He says I need more exercise in the open air. "Come, now, are you providing me with the means of a rapid retreat? " 
said I. "I am pretty badly equipped for marching. "

<a href='/results.php?tla=rog' rel=''>Mrs. Rose Greenhow</a> is in Richmond. One-half of the 
ungrateful Confederates say <a href='/results.php?tla=wls' rel=''>Seward</a> sent her. My husband says the Confederacy owes her a debt it can never pay. 
She warned them at Manassas, and so they got <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston</a> and his Paladins to appear upon the stage in the very nick 
of time. In Washington they said Lord Napier left her a legacy to the British Legation, which accepted the gift, unlike the British nation, who would not accept Emma Hamilton and her daughter, Horatia, though they were willed to 
the nation by Lord Nelson.

Mem Cohen, fresh from the hospital where she went with a beautiful Jewish friend. Rachel, as we will call her 
(be it her name or no) , was put to feed a very weak patient. Mem noticed what a handsome fellow he was and how quiet 
and clean. She fancied by those tokens that he was a Gentleman. In performance of her duties, the lovely young 
nurse leaned kindly over him and held the cup to his lips. When that ceremony was over and she had wiped his 
mouth, to her horror she felt a pair of by no means weak arms around her neck and a kiss upon her lips, which she 
thought strong, indeed. She did not say a word ; she made no complaint. She slipped away from the hospital, and 
hereafter in her hospital work will minister at long range, no matter how weak and weary, sick and sore, the patient 
may be. And, said Mem, "I thought he was a gentle man." " Well, a gentleman is a man, after all, and she 
ought not to have put those red lips of hers so near.
