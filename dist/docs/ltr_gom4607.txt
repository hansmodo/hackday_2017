My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Although I have been above a month in this city, I have not 
been able until within a day or two to make up my mind, as to 
the sentiments of the person mentioned to you in mine of the 
twenty-first of March, or rather I could not obtain that certainty which was needful, before I could properly mention them 
to you. I can now venture to assure you, that by coming into 
office he has not changed his sentiments. 
</p><p>
My former letters have mentioned to you the indiscipline of 
the French armies, and the public prints will give you such 
facts on that head, as may tend to making up in your mind 
a solid judgment as to future events. The first step towards 
bankruptcy has already been made, by extending to seventeen 
hundred millions the sum of Assignats, which may be in circulation. A further extension must take place in a few days. 
The powers combined against France have it therefore in their 
choice, to wear her out by a war of resources, or dash into the 
heart of the country. This last will best suit with their own 
situation, but I do not think they will advance before the be 
ginning of August. 
</p><p>
Your letter to the King has produced a very good effect. 
It is not relished by the Democrats, who particularly dislike 
the term your people, but it suits well the prevailing temper, 
which is monarchical. The Jacobin faction approaches to its 
dissolution, as you may perceive by its agonies. In fact, the 
deliberations are so absurd and so extravagantly wild, that they 
daily furnish new arms to their enemies. You will perceive at 
a glance, that this is not a moment for making commercial treaties. I shall however do all that I can, without seriously com 
promising our future interests. I am, &c.
