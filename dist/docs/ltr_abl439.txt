GENERAL HUNTER AND ADMIRAL DUPONT:
</p><p>
This is intended to clear up an apparent inconsistency between the
recent order to continue operations before Charleston and the former
one to remove to another point in a certain contingency. No censure
upon you, or either of you, is intended. We still hope that by
cordial and judicious co-operation you can take the batteries on
Morris Island and Sullivan's Island and Fort Sumter. But whether you
can or not, we wish the demonstration kept up for a time, for a
collateral and very important object. We wish the attempt to be a
real one, though not a desperate one, if it affords any considerable
chance of success. But if prosecuted as a demonstration only, this
must not become public, or the whole effect will be lost. Once again
before Charleston, do not leave until further orders from here. Of
course this is not intended to force you to leave unduly exposed
Hilton Head or other near points in your charge.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p><p>

P. S.--Whoever receives this first, please send a copy to the other
immediately.
