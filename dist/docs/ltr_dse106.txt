Dear Len-<br><br>

More trouble on the Gail Ann Brough front. When I went down to see her yesterday
I found the enclosed letter from the Franchise Tax Board informing her that a lien 
had been placed on all her property. (She had not yet even opened the letter.)<br><br>

I have finally obtained the papers from probate of her mother's will showing the appraised
value of the stocks sold in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1985">1985</a>. You already have the Birr Wilson statements showing 
net amount received.<br><br>

So far I have not obtained the year end statements from Birr Wilson that you requested.
I wrote, enclosing a check to cover their service charge. They cashed the check but
supplied no statements. I called the man to whom I sent my request, and he said
he never received it. I'm following up.<br><br>

The check responds to your statement of 9/19. I would like to keep Gail's charges
separate from my own because I will pass the costs on to her if I ever get her affairs
into a condition where she can pay.<br><br>

We are moving in about a month and a half and will have many things to throw out. My wife
wants to know how long we should keep tax returns and supporting data; I think we still 
have everything over the past 38 years, and all our cancelled checks too.<br><br>
Please give me a call at your convenience.<br><br>
Regards - <br>
