DEAR SIR, The delay in providing for the commencement 
of the Government was terminated yesterday, by an acquiescence of the minor number in the persevering demands of the 
major. The time for choosing the Electors is the first Wednesday in January, and for choosing the President, the first Wednesday in February. The meeting of the Government is to be the 
first Wednesday in March, and in the city of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. The 
times were adjusted to the meetings of the State Legislatures. 
The plan was the result of the dilemma to which the opponents 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> were reduced, of yielding to its advocates or 
strangling the Government in its birth. The necessity of yielding and the impropriety of further delay have been for some 
time obvious to me, but others did not view the matter in the 
same light. Maryland and Delaware were absolutely inflexible. 
It has, indeed, been too apparent that local considerations have 
very improperly predominated in this question, and that something more is aimed at than merely the first session of the Government at this place. Every circumstance has shewn that the 
policy is to keep Congress here till a permanent seat be chosen, 
and to obtain a permanent seat, at farthest, not beyond the Susquehannah. New Jersey, by its Legislature, as well as its delegation in Congress, has clearly discovered her view to be a temporary appointment of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, as affording the best chance 
of a permanent establishment at Trenton. I have been made 
so fully sensible of these views in the course of the business, as 
well as of the impropriety of so excentric a position as New 
York, that I could have finally concurred in any plan more 
Southward to which the Eastern States would have acceded; 
and, previous to the definitive vote, a motion was made tendering 
a blank for that purpose. At any place South of the Delaware, 
the Susquehannah, at least, would have been secured, and a 
hope given to the Potowmac. As the case is, I conceive the 
Susquehannah to be the utmost to be hoped for, with no small 
danger of being stopped at the Delaware. Besides this consequence, the decision will, I fear, be regarded as at once a proof 
of the preponderancy of the Eastern strength, and of a disposition to make an unfair use of it; and it cannot but happen that 
the question will be entailed on the new Government, which 
will have enough of other causes of agitation in its Councils.

The meeting at Harrisburg is represented by its friends aa 
having been conducted with much harmony and moderation. Its 
proceedings are said to be in the press, and will, of course, soon 
be before the public. I find all the mischief apprehended from 
Clinton's circular letter in Virginia will be verified. The Antifederalists lay hold of it with eagerness as the harbinger of a 
second Convention, and as the Governor espouses the project, 
it will certainly have the co-operation of our Assembly.

I enclose a sensible little pamphlet, which falls within the 
plan of investigating and comparing the the languages of the Aboriginal Americans.

With sincerest attachment, I am, D'r Sir, your obt and very 
</p><p>
h'ble serv. .
