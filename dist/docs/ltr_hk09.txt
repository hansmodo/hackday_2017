2221 Bancroft Way Berkeley <br> Oct. 1, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1918">1918</a> <br><br> Dear Horace:- <br> Well you have looked a long while for this letter and I know I ought to be licked 
for not writing sooner, but there is no one here to do it. I suppose, to begin 
with, I’d better ‘fess up and break the news to you that I have eloped. Guess 
it came as a surprise to some people down Sunnyvale way. Say, but it was great 
fun beating it off while the coast was clear. Glad we had a machine to go in. 
It all happened last Sunday. We are settled here in Berkeley, have housekeeping 
rooms and are both going to college. The victim, my husband I mean, is tall, good 
looking, brown hair, gray eyes, and best of all a good disposition. That’s about 
all so but not just exactly as strung out. I eloped with father - yes, really 
truly ran away from [picture of car] and went up to Mt. View and got Ruth Davies 
and came to Berkeley. Ruth and I are keeping house together. She is the head of 
the house an I am the other half. It was father’s first elopement, - mine too. 
I enjoyed it so much I think I’ll try it again sometime. It was just exactly like 
an elopement - the excitement and rush and all; all except the sentiment. I know 
you’ll think I’m hard-hearted for writing that way but - They are building barracks 
on the campus for 5000 soldiers and 500 sailors. Ruth and I live just a block 
away - isn’t that terrible! Well to get down to business. We had one awful rain 
beginning Sept. 11 in the evening and lasting over 2 ½ days and nights. We had 
6.2 inches rain in a short time. Our skylight leaked like a sieve and on top of 
that Louise’s goat had climbed on top of the house roof and gone thru one pane 
of the skylight so it just poured thru there. We just about had to go around in 
a flat boat in the kitchen or else swim. It damaged your hay, what there was left 
of it. We have the framework and rafters up on our house. They completely changed 
the plan. It is to be a bungalow - all on the ground floor. 7 rooms, gray plastered 
on the outside; and a brick roof either red or gray. It is built right west of 
our old shop, - there in the garden. [hand drawn plan and front elevation sketches 
are included in the body of the letter]. This is quite small but it may give you 
an idea of what it is going to be like when you come home. <br><br> Yours Truly Helen Tompkins
