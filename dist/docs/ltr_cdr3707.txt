Sir, 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> has wrote to the Viscount de Noailles, his brother-in-law, and shows the greatest desire to see him. I find his demand so just, that though I have given leave to several of our Colonels 
to go and wait on your Excellency, I have added 
likewise the Viscount de Noailles, and the Marquis de Damas. If your Excellency does not find a moment to come and see this part of your army, I am 
afraid that the whole of it will desert, so great is 
their desire to see their General. I beg you will be 
persuaded of the extreme desire I would have to receive you here, if you can find an opportunity. The 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cdt' rel='colleague'>Chevalier De Ternay</a> has sent back to-day Mr. Roger, 
Arbuthnot's Lieutenant, who was here for the second 
time as a flag of truce. He had kept him three 
weeks, pretty closely confined in his vessel, to weaken a little his desire of making us a third visit. He 
sends likewise a flag to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, to carry some 
ladies. I am, with respect. Sir, &c., 
</p><p>
