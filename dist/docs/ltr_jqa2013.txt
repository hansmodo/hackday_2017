DEAR MADAM : 
</p><p>
It is a long time since I wrote you last, but I am perfectly weary of making apologies. I have no doubt but 
my friends will forgive me, when they recollect the causes which have prevented me from informing them frequently 
of those trivial events, which the partiality of friendship alone can render interesting. When I was last in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> 
which was about two months ago, I wrote a few hasty 
lines to my father, intending to write more largely soon after my return to this place. I have delayed fulfilling my 
intentions from time to time, either from the want of an opportunity, or from the multiplicity of my employments, 
and even now, I know not whether this letter will go within these three months.

In the beginning of September I came to this town, and began the study of the law with Mr. Parsons. I could 
not possibly have an instructor more agreeable than this gentleman. His talents are great, his application has been 
indefatigable, and his professional knowledge is surpassed by no gentleman in the Commonwealth. The study itself 
is far from being so destitute of entertainment as I had been led to expect. I have read three or four authors with 
pleasure as well as improvement, and the imaginary terrors of tediousness and disgust, have disappeared, upon the 
first approach. But in their stead other fears have arisen which create more anxiety in my mind, and which will 
increase rather than subside. The popular odium which has been excited against the practitioner in this Common 
wealth prevails to so great a degree, that the most innocent and irreproachable life cannot guard a lawyer against the 
hatred of his fellow citizens. The very despicable writings of Honestus were just calculated to kindle a flame 
which will subsist long after they are forgotten. The author 
after being hoisted by this weak instrument into the Senate 
has already returned to his native insignificancy, and under 
the new adopted signature of Candidus, defends a good 
cause without ability and without success. But the poison 
has been so extensively communicated, that its infection 
will not easily be stopped. A thousand lies in addition to 
those published in the papers have been spread all over 
the country, to prejudice the people against the order, as 
it has invidiously been called ; and as a free people will 
not descend to disguise their sentiments, the gentlemen of 
the profession have been treated with contemptuous neglect, and with insulting abuse. But notwithstanding all this the profession is increasing rapidly in numbers, and 
the little business to be done is divided into so many shares, 
that they are in danger of starving one another. When I 
consider these disadvantages, which are in a degree peculiar 
to the present time, and those which at all times subsist; 
when I reflect that good abilities, great application, and a 
favorable fortune are requisite to acquire that eminence in 
the profession which can insure a decent subsistence, I 
confess I am sometimes almost discouraged, and ready to 
wish I had engaged in some other line of life. But I am 
determined not to despond. With industry and frugality, 
with patience and perseverance, it will be very hard if I 
cannot go through the world with honor. I am most 
resolutely determined not to spend my days in a dull tenor 
of insipidity. I never shall be enough of a stoic to raise 
myself beyond the reach of fortune. But I hope I shall 
have so much resolution as shall enable me to receive prosperity without growing giddy and extravagant, or adver sity without falling into despair.

I board at a Mrs. Leathers s, a good old woman, who 
even an hundred years ago would have stood in no danger 
of being hanged for witchcraft. She is however civil and 
obliging, and what is very much in her favor, uncommonly 
silent ; so that if I am deprived of the charms, I am also 
free from the impertinence of conversation. There is one 
boarder beside myself a Dr. Kilham, (I hope the name 
will not scare you) one of the representatives from this 
town, a very worthy man, and a man of sense and learning. 
Was it not for him I should be at my lodgings as solitary 
as an hermit. There is a very agreeable society in the town, 
though I seldom go into company.

I passed two or three days at Haverhill, about a month 
ago, and had the pleasure of finding Mr. Thaxter. From the severest censurer of every trifling attentions between 
lovers, he became as fond a shepherd as ever was celebrated 
in the annals of Arcadia. He expects some peculiar animadversions from you, for his desertion of principles, which 
he formerly boasted were so deeply rooted in his mind. But it is the old story of Benedick. The absurdity is not 
in abandoning a vain, ineffectual resolution, but it is in pretending to adopt a resolution, which every day may be rendered futile. 
</p><p>
I have frequently been prevented from expatiating in my letters upon political topics by the sterility of the 
subject; an uncommon fertility now produces the same effect. I can only say in general terms that parties run 
very high, and that we are most probably at the eve of a revolution. Whether it will be effected in silence, and 
without a struggle, or whether it will be carried at the point of the sword, is yet a question. The newspapers will 
show you how much the public is engaged in the discus sion of the new continental form of government, which I fear will be adopted. 
</p><p>
From the remainder of the family you will probably hear, by the same opportunity that is to convey this. When 
I last heard from my brothers they were well. Your ever affectionate son.
