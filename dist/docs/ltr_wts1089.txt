My Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
As to matters and things in Florida, they are as they 
have always been, Indians plenty always coming, but 
none come, whilst the officer commanding flatters himself 
the war is just on the point of ending. 
</p><p>
A short time ago a ship went ashore about sixty miles 
south of this, from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a> bound to Cowes, with 
a cargo of tobacco and Dutchmen (two hundred and odd). 
The latter went ashore, taking a tent and some beef and 
pork; but fortunately the steamboat that runs on the 
coast found them, and advised them to go aboard this 
vessel whilst she went in search of some wreckers (a 
species of pirates, who, for a high per cent, save portions of cargo and sometimes ship), who returned to her 
and luckily got her off the beach, it being calm ; but it 
seems that whilst the steamboat was gone, some Indians 
came down on the beach and stole the things they had 
put ashore. As soon as we learned this, Major Childs, 
who commands here, immediately fitted out an expedition to look into matters and things down in that section. An old Spaniard we have here informed us that 
in rear of where the vessel had gone ashore there was 
a fine lake, and in all likelihood the Indians lived on it. 
As the object was to get on this lake in small open boats, 
this we effected by going an inland passage for forty 
miles, then hauled our boats over a narrow strip of land 
into the sea, launched our boats, and, going about ten 
miles further, landed, and hauled our boats again into 
the unexplored lake. We were here six days, searching 
the islands and bays, and though we found evidences of 
a great number of Indians and canoes, we were able to 
discover but two fellows, who escaped us. We got, 
however, plenty of roasting ears, sweet potatoes, sugarcane, and other Indian things. A great many fields, 
amounting in all to upwards of thirty acres, in very 
fine cultivation indeed, having, beside what I've already 
mentioned, beans, pumpkins, tobacco, and rice. So you 
see that Indians know, beside the use of their legs and 
the rifle, that of the hoe. But a few days ago a vessel 
belonging to the Government, and loaded with supplies 
for this post, ran ashore about thirty miles north of us. 
I was sent up with thirty men, and though I was unable 
to save the vessel, I succeeded in bringing off about 
$1000 worth of provisions and property. . . . 
Your affectionate brother,
