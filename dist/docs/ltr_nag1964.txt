HEADQUARTERS

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charles Town</a> June 26th <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1783">1783</a>

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving two letters from you since you left this place one from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=augusta" rel="city">Augusta</a> the other from Savannah. The grant of 
the Cherokees I imagine will be of but little consequence if the Creeks continue to disclaim their right of granting. An Indian war I expect will 
be the consequence and if Georgia is not aided by the neighboring states or the force of the State greatly increased by new settlers the indians will 
contend upon no very unequal footing. I wish all these matters were to be settled by Commissioners from Congress Both parties perhaps would be 
better satisfied. It is pretty certain there would be less reason for disputes. 
</p><p>
Congress have forwarded me a resolution for furloughing the Army ; and orders are gone out for the purpose. Major Habersham has a copy 
of the orders and the resolution. Transport are hourly expected to take the Northern Troops to the respective States to which they belong where 
both Men and Officers are to be furloughed until the signing of the definitive treaty and then to be discharged. 
</p><p>
What has become of the Virginia Infantry you took with you? Have they gone to Virginia on the uper route or are they to join here again? 
</p><p>
Since you left us there has been great uneasiness among the Troops from an impatience to get home The terrors of the climate and the 
discontent natural to idleness has produced great desertions ; and near one half the 3 d Regiment of Cavalry went off in a body. 
</p><p>
All our Waggons and public Stores in the Quarter Masters department are sold. Our Military Stores are depositing in the Magazine of this 
State and all our arrangements are drawing to a close. I expect to leave this place in less than a month for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. What can Governor 
Tonyn mean by his extraordinary conduct? It must be the effects of temper ; and not the result 
ot orders. However Congress have remonstrated against the conduct of the british Generals in withholding the property of the people of the 
United States contrary to treaty. 
</p><p>
Dueling thrives apace here. Cap Pendleton and M 1 : Waters have been out the latter got wounded the former not. Col. Easton has been 
out with a Mr r . Rule; but the matter was accomodated on the ground. Disputes have run high among a number more ; but the intervention of 
friends prevented a serious appeal to heaven. 
</p><p>
Mrs Greene sailed for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> about fort night since and left her good wishes for you on your return. How is Major Fishbourn ? We 
hear he has been at deaths door and gave a soft tap but was not admitted. Present me respectfully to all friends in Georgia and believe me to 
be with esteem and affection your
