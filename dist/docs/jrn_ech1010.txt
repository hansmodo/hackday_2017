We are detained here in Happy Valley, keeping ourselves in readiness to attend the landing of our freight. As yet we have been unable to get our goods off the vessel on account of the Captain's being drunk nearly all the time and having already discharged three or four sets of seamen. There is no telling when we can leave this place.
<p></p>
At the request of two gentlemen from Wilmington, Delaware, who were fellow passengers in the Europe, I have written an unvarnished tale and forwarded for publication to the editors of the Blue Hen's Chicken of that place, in the hope that when the villainous conduct of Captain Palmer and his rascally employers becomes known, those who are about coming after us may escape the hardships caused by the trickery and deception of these accomplished robbers. Indeed the vessel was a perfect Hades and I would not pass such an ordeal again for all the gold in California. They can draw their own inferences. I advised those who are about to leave good homes for the land of promise to "look before they leap" and beware of such men as we bargained with.

We find that we have encumbered ourselves with
too much baggage and all are now endeavoring to lessen the bulk and weight of their clothing. Many are selling at less than cost to raise a few dollars. I sold six pairs of good new pantaloons for fifteen dollars. As I was anxious to make a little money, I assisted in removing several chests a short way from the beach, for which I received fifty cents. Saturday evening I strolled up to the city in company with McCowan who had a violin to sell and Atkins who took a wrapper with him for the same purpose. I have made a camp cot to carry with me to the mines, also a fine, large knapsack to take with me, intending to leave my trunks here.

Our section, composed of six persons, owns a variety of property in common, most of which we have disposed of, but not delivered because of the difficulty in getting it off the vessel. Some were in a great hurry to sell our tent, of which I had thus far refused my consent. But we had an offer of $45 for it and as dissatisfaction began to prevail, I thought I should take them at their word, and the tent was sold, possession to be given Monday morning. This took some of them aback and they began discussing what they should do on the morrow. But I cared little what they did. Atkins and I can agree very well, and we decided to purchase a tent of our own and go to the mines together.
<p></p>
Immediately after breakfast Monday morning we struck our large section tent and carried it off to Clark's Point, where we met the persons we sold it to, and they paid me forty-five dollars in gold dust. I did not like the dust, for in money it brings only fifteen and a half to the ounce, but when I came to exchange it for money, it made forty-six dollars and fifty cents, just making the percentage they charged for changing it. McCowan,
<p></p>
Atkins and myself immediately went and purchased a small tent for twenty dollars, surprising our party very much when we brought it upon the ground. We soon pitched it and removed our things under cover, and we have as good a roof over our head as we have had since we landed. A little rain fell last night but our tent fended it off in first-rate style, not even making our blankets damp.
<p></p>
In the morning we generally have a thick, heavy fog; at noon the atmosphere is as warm as June in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, and at night a cold westerly wind blows. This evening while I am writing, our late seamen, being encamped quite near us, are singing some merry tunes. They have no tents but have raised a kind of hut and covered it with their blankets.

Sunday evening while I was boiling mush to fry for breakfast, a Methodist preacher came up and invited me to attend prayer meeting in a large tent quite near our own. I soon finished the mush and went to hear him awhile.
