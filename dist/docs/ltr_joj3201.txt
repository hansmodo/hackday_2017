DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The questions contained in your favor of the 23d 
instant, are as important as the manner of introducing them is delicate. While the maritime affairs of 
the Continent continue under the direction of a Committee, they will be exposed to all the consequences 
of want of system, attention, and knowledge. The 
Marine Committee consists of a Delegate from each 
State. It fluctuates, new members constantly coming 
in, and old ones going out. Three or four, indeed, 
have remained in it from the beginning, and have a 
proportionate influence, or, more properly, interest in 
it. Very few of the members understand even the 
state of our naval affairs, or have time or inclination 
to attend to them. But why is not this system 
changed? It is, in my opinion, convenient to the family compact. The Commercial Committee are equally 
useless. A proposition was made to appoint a Commercial Agent for the States, under certain regulations. Opposition was made ; the ostensible reasons 
were various ; the true reason was, its interference 
with a certain commercial agent in Europe, and his 
connections. 
</p><p>
You will, if I mistake not^ find M. Gerard disposed 
to be open and communicative. He has acquired an 
extensive knowledge of our affairs. I have no reason 
to believe he will use it to our prejudice. There is 
as much intrigue in this State House as in the Vatican, but as little secrecy as in a boarding-school. It 
mortifies me, on this occasion, to reflect, that the rules 
of Congress on the subject of secrecy, which are far too general, and, perhaps for that reason, more frequently violated, restrain me from saying twenty 
things to you, which have ceased to be private. 
</p><p>
The state of our currency is really serious. Where, 
or by what means, the progress of its depreciation 
will be prevented, is uncertain. The subject is deli 
cate, but the conduct of some men really indicates at 
least great indifference about it. It will not be many 
days before measures^ having a great though not 
immediate influence on this subject, will be either 
adopted or rejected. I shall then have an opportunity of being more particular. I am, very dear Sir. 
with perfect esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
