Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
I see some signs of hope, but it is probably a deceptive 
light. The very moment you feel uncomfortable in your 
position in Louisiana, come away. Don't for God's sake 
subject yourself to any slur, reproach, or indignity. I 
have spoken to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="met">General Scott</a>, and he heartily seconds 
your desire to return to duty in the army. I am not at 
all sure but that, if you were here, you could get a position that would suit you. I see many of your friends of 
the army daily. 
</p><p>
As for my views of the present crisis, I could not state 
them more fully than I have in the enclosed printed 
letter. It has been very generally published and approved in the North, but may not have reached you, and 
therefore I send it to you. 
</p><p>
Affectionately your brother, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jos" rel="me">John Sherman</a>.
