HON. SIR, * * * * * * 
</p><p>
The following odd affair has furnished the court of this county 
with some very unexpected business. 
</p><p>
Two persons travelling from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> to the southward, 
one of them a Frenchman and an officer in the Continental 
army, and the other a man of decent figure, came to the courthouse on the evening of the court day, and immediately inquired 
for a member of the committee. Being withdrawn with several 
members into a private room, they gave information that they fell 
in with a man on the road a few miles from the court-house, who, 
in the course of conversation on public affairs, gave abundant 
proof of his being an adherent to the King of Great Britain, 
and a dangerous enemy to the State; that he ran into the most 
outrageous abuse of our proceedings, and on their threatening 
to inform against him, in the most daring manner bid defiance 
to committees, or whoever should pretend to judge or punish 
him. They said the man they alluded to had come with them 
to the court-house, and they made no doubt but they could point 
him out in the crowd. On their so doing, the culprit appeared 
to be Benjamin Haley. As the committee had no jurisdiction 
in the case, it was referred to a justice of the peace. Every 
one seemed to be agreed that his conduct was a direct violation 
of law, and called aloud for public notice; but the witnesses 
being travellers, and therefore unable to attend at a' trial, it 
was thought best not to undertake a prosecution which promised nothing but impunity and matter of triumph to the offender. 
Here the affair dropped, and every one supposed was entirely 
at an end; but as the Frenchman was accidentally passing 
through the room where Haley was, he took occasion to admonish the people of his being a disaffected person, and upbraided him for his tory principles. This introduced a debate, 
which was continued for some time with great heat on the part 
of the Frenchman, and great insolence on the part of Haley. 
At the request of the latter, they at length both appeared before 
a justice of the peace. Haley at first evaded the charges of 
his antagonist; but after some time, said he scorned to be counterfeit, and in answer to some questions that were put to him, 
signified that we were in the state of rebellion and had revolted 
from our lawful Sovereign, and that if the King had justice 
done him, his authority would still be in exercise among us. 
This passed in the presence of twenty or thirty persons, and 
rendered the testimony of the travellers needless. A warrant 
</p><p>
for arresting him was immediately issued and executed. The 
criminal went through his examination, in which his very pleas 
seemed to aggravate his guilt. Witnesses were summoned, 
sworn, and their evidences taken; and on his obstinate refusal 
to give security for his appearance, he was committed to close 
gaol. This happened about eight o'clock. I have since heard 
he begged about one o'clock in the morning to be admitted to 
bail, and went home, but not without threats of revenge, and 
making public declaration that he was King George's man. I 
have stated the case thus particularly that you may, if an opportunity occurs, take the advice of some gentleman skilled in 
the law, on the most proper and legal mode of proceeding 
against him.
