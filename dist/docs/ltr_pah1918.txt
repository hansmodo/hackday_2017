DEAR SIR : You will no doubt, be surprised at seeing the enclosed letter, in which the encomiums bestowed on me are as undeserved, as the censures 
aimed at you are unjust. I am sorry there should be one man who counts himself my friend who is not yours. 
</p><p>
Perhaps I give you needless trouble in handing you this paper. The writer of it may be too insignificant to deserve any notice. If I knew this to be 
the case, I should not have intruded on your time, which is so precious. But there may possibly be some scheme or party forming to your prejudice. 
The enclosed leads to such a suspicion. Believe me, sir, I have too high a sense of the obligations America has to you, to abet or countenance so unworthy 
a proceeding. The most exalted merit hath ever been found to attract envy. But I please myself with the hope, that the same fortitude and greatness 
of mind which have hitherto braved all the difficulties and dangers inseparable from your station, will rise superior to every attempt of the envious partisan. 
</p><p>
I really cannot tell who is the writer of this letter, which not a little perplexes me. The hand writing is altogether strange to me. 
</p><p>
To give you the trouble of this gives me pain. It would suit my inclination better to give you some assistance in the great business of the war. But I 
will not conceal any thing from you by which you may be affected ; for I really think your personal welfare and the happiness of America are intimately 
connected. I beg you will be assured of that high regard and esteem, with which I am, dear sir, your affectionate friend and very humble servant,
