Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
From our preliminaries and the king's speech, the present 
disposition and system of the British court may, in my 
opinion, be collected. Although particular circumstances 
constrained them to yield us more than perhaps they 
wished, I still think they meant to make (what they thought 
would really be) a satisfactory peace with us. In the continuance of this disposition and system too much confidence 
ought not to be placed, for disappointed violence and mortified ambition are certainly dangerous foundations to build 
implicit confidence upon ; but I cannot forbear thinking 
that we ought not, in the common phrase, to throw cold 
water upon it by improper exultation, extravagant demands, 
or illiberal publications ; should such a temper appear, it 
would be wise to discountenance it. It is our policy to be 
independent in the most extrusive sense, and to observe a 
proper distance towards all nations, minding our own business, and not interfering with, or being influenced bv, the 
views of any, further than they may respect us. 
</p><p>
Some of my colleagues flatter themselves with the probability of obtaining compensation for damages. I have no 
objections to a further trial, but I confess I doubt its success, for Britain has no money to spare, and will think the 
confiscations should settle that account, for they do not 
expect that retribution will be made to all. 
</p><p>
Our affairs have a very promising aspect, and a little 
prudence will secure us all that we can reasonably expect. 
The boundaries between the States should be immediately 
settled, and all causes of discord between them removed. 
It would be imprudent to disband the army while a foreign 
one remains in the country; and it would be equally unwise to permit Americans to spill the blood of our friends 
in the islands, for in all of them there are many who wish 
us well. The sale of the continental lands would, if properly regulated and appropriated to that purpose, form a 
fund on which we might borrow money, especially if 
foreigners could see good reason to rely on our good faith, 
which, by being in certain instances violated, has lost much 
of its credit. I allude particularly to the interest on loanoffice certificates, and the publications in our papers on that 
subject, which do us harm in Europe. Adieu. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Robert, 
</p><p>
Your friend,
