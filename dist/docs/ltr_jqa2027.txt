MY DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
As I was going to meeting this afternoon a gentleman met me in the street, and desired me to fill him a writ immediately, which he intends to have served as early as possible in the morning. I accordingly did it, and it is now too 
late to attend the afternoon service. I think I cannot em 
ploy the leisure time thus thrown on my hands better than 
in giving you an account of the commercial catastrophe now 
taking place in this town, which occasioned the singular 
application to me that I have just mentioned. The bubble 
of banking is breaking, and I am very apprehensive that it 
will prove as distressing to this town as that of stock-jobbing 
was about twelve months since at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. Seven or 
eight failures of considerable consequence have happened 
within these three days, and many more arc inevitable I 
think in the course of the ensuing week. The pernicious 
practice of mutual indorsements upon each other's notes has 
been carried as now appears to an extravagant length, and 
is now found to have involved not only the principals, who 
have been converting their loans from the bank into a regular 
trading stock, but many others who have undertaken to be 
their security. The stagnation of trade produced in the fall 
of the year by the smallpox, and very much increased by a remarkably open winter, which has not admitted of the 
usual facility of communication with the country upon the 
snow, have undoubtedly accelerated this calamity, which, 
however, would have been the more oppressive the longer 
it would have been deferred. 
</p><p>
These misfortunes will undoubtedly give a degree of 
activity to my particular profession which has not for several 
years been allotted to it. But I shall personally derive but 
very little immediate benefit from it. I see no prospect of 
its adding much to my business at present, and if it should, 
there is no satisfaction in thriving by the misery of others. 
</p><p>
I received last evening your favor with a quotation from 
the Echo, which has been read here, as well as the Hartford 
newscarrier's wit, with pleasure by those who are fond of 
laughing at the follies of our great man. The situation of 
our affairs is such, and the passions and rivalries of our 
most conspicuous characters assume an aspect so alarming, 
that we have indeed much to apprehend for the fate of the 
country. It is a subject upon which my mind does not 
dwell with pleasure, and I am the more desirous to keep 
myself altogether unconnected with political topics, because 
my sentiments in general I find are as unpopular as my con 
duct relative to the town police or to the theatrical questions. 
I have no predilection for unpopularity as such, but I hold 
it much preferable to the popularity of a day, which perishes 
with the transient topic upon which it is grounded ; and 
therefore I persisted in refusing to appear at the anarchical 
dinner which was denominated a civic feast, though I was 
urged strongly by several of my friends to become a sub 
scriber upon principles of expediency. Those friends dis 
liked the whole affair quite as much as I did, but thought 
it was necessary to comply with the folly of the day. Upon 
the whole however it appears to me that the celebration 
of that day has had rather an advantageous than an injurious effect. The specimens of equality exhibited in the 
course of it did not suit the palates of many who had joined 
in the huzzas. The Governor thought it proper to be sick 
and not attend, and I believe has ventured to express his 
disapprobation of the proceedings in several particulars. 
We have Jacobins enough, but in this instance they overshot 
themselves, and shewed their teeth and claws so injudiciously, as to guard even the weaker members of the community against them. 
</p><p>
At a period, when all the European powers with whom we have 
any considerable commercial intercourse, are involved in war, 
it becomes an interesting question to every American, what line 
of conduct ought to be pursued by the United States as a nation, 
and by their citizens as individuals, in relation to the contending 
parties. The individual must follow the dictates of his own discretion, and the path to be pursued by the nation must be pointed 
out by the wisdom of the National Legislation : But upon a subject 
in which all are so deeply interested, it is the right, and in some 
measure the duty of every citizen, to express his opinions with 
decency, but with freedom and sincerity. 
</p><p>
The solution of the question as it respects the country, involves in itself an answer to that which relates to individuals. There 
have indeed been certain suggestions in the public papers, and in 
private circles something similar has been heard, of an intention 
among some of our fellow citizens to arm privateers, and commit 
depredations upon the commerce of one of the parties under 
the authority of another. It is to be hoped that this violation of 
the laws of nature and nations, this buccaneering plan of piratical 
plunder, may not in any instance be carried beyond the airy regions 
of speculation, and may never acquire the consistency of practical 
execution. If the natural obligations of justice are so feeble 
among us, that avarice cannot be restrained from robbery, but 
by the provisions of positive law, if the statute book is to be our 
only rule of morality to regulate the observance of our duties 
towards our fellow creatures, let those whose ideas of equality are 
so very subservient to their private interests, consult the treaties 
between the United States and the several powers now at war, 
which by the constitution of the United States, are declared to be 
"the supreme law of the land," and in the 2ist, the igth and 
the 2Oth articles of the several treaties of commerce with France, 
Holland and Prussia, they will find, that by taking letters of 
marque or arming privateers with commissions under either 
of the powers against either of the others, they would subject 
themselves to the punishment of pirates. There can be no doubt 
but that a similar act of hostility against any subject of the king 
of Great Britain, would be a direct violation of the yth article 
of the treaty of peace. If we were not bound by any treaty 
whatever, with either of the nations, the natural obligation of 
neutrality would operate upon us individually, unless the nation 
should take a decisive part in favor of one of the parties. Every 
citizen would be legally responsible for all the property which he 
might seize with violence under a commission to which he could 
not be entitled, and if he should preserve himself from the punishment of piracy, he would be liable to make entire satisfaction for 
all the damage he might occasion, and to restore his ill-acquired plunder. 
</p><p>
It is indeed of material importance to the commercial interest 
of this country, that our merchants should show a peculiar degree 
of circumspection in their conduct, because the country becomes at 
a season so critical as this, in some measure responsible for them. 
In the just and honorable pursuit of their legitimate interest, it is 
the duty of the nation to support them with all its force and all 
its authority. In time of war, the subjects of all belligerent powers 
are frequently disposed to violate the rights of neutral nations. 
The master and the crew of a privateer, fitted out and cruising 
for the sole purpose of seizing upon defenceless wealth, and stimulated by the prospect of a valuable spoil, often feel the full force 
of disappointed rapaciousness, when after a long chase they 
discover that the ship, upon the plunder of whose cargo they had 
already feasted their imaginations, is rescued from their violence 
by the protection of a neutral flag. They are not apt to be nice 
in their distinctions of morality. Their disappointed passions 
often seek a vent against the unarmed opulence which eludes 
their grasps, and they are frequently guilty of insolence, and 
sometimes of oppression towards those who are not in a condition 
to resent their injustice. In such case the individuals of the 
neutral nation, who suffer in consequence of such lawless proceedings, have no remedy but to call upon the sovereign of their 
own country to support them in their demand for satisfaction : 
Should any complaints arising from causes like this become a 
subject of negotiation, between the United States and either of 
the contending parties, it behoves us all, as we value our interests, 
or our reputation, that no occasion to retort a complaint that 
the neutrality was first violated on our part, should be given. In 
order to obtain justice, for any citizen who may suffer by the iniquity of a foreigner, we must disavow in the most decisive manner, 
all acts of iniquity committed by our own citizens, and our government can never have an expectation of gaining a compensation 
for the injured individual, unless they can compel the injuring 
individual to make compensation in his turn. 
</p><p>
To expatiate upon the natural injustice and wickedness of privateering under a foreign commission against a nation at peace 
with us, would be as idle as an attempt "to add a perfume to the 
violet." The practise of privateering, even in its most excusable 
form, between nations formally at war, has been condemned by 
the most amiable and virtuous moralists. In the treaty between 
the United States and the King of Prussia, it is provided that in 
case war should arise between the contracting parties, "All mer 
chant and trading vessels employed in exchanging the products of 
different places, and thereby rendering the necessaries, conveniences and comforts of human life more easy to be obtained, and 
more general, shall be allowed to pass free and unmolested : 
and neither of the contracting powers shall grant or issue 
any commission to any private armed vessel, empowering 
them to take or destroy such trading vessels or interrupt such 
commerce/ l This clause in the treaty, which was I believe the 
first instance in which two great nations have adopted this system 
of benevolence and humanity, has been justly admired and applauded ; it was adopted by the late French National Assembly, 
when they declared war against the Emperor of Germany, and 
the real friends of mankind must regret that the policy is abandoned 
at this time, when the war extends to all the great commercial 
nations of Europe. For, if as the poet, with more than poetical 
truth, has said, "War is murder," the plunder of private property, 
the pillage of all the regular rewards of honest industry and 
laudable enterprise, upon the mere pretence of a national contest, 
to the eye of reason and justice, can appear in no other light than 
that of highway robbery. If, however, some apology for the 
practice is to be derived from the uncontrollable laws of necessity, 
or from the iniquitous law of war, certainly there can be no possible 
excuse for those who incur the guilt without being able to plead 
the palliation ; for those who by violating the rights of nations in 
order to obtain a licence for rapine, manifestly show, that it is 
only the lash of the executioner that binds them to the observance 
of their civil and political dut es. Non nostrum, tantas componere lites. 
</p><p>
Having attempted in a late paper to show that a rigid adherence 
to the system of Neutrality between the European nations now at 
war, is equally the dictate of justice and of policy, to the individual 
citizens of the United States, while the Nation remains neutral, 
the question recurs, what is the line of conduct prescribed to the 
nation itself, at this delicate juncture, by those immutable laws of 
justice and equity, which are equally obligatory to sovereigns and 
to subjects, to republics and to kings. I shall not make any 
consideration of general policy a separate subject of inquiry, 
because I hold it to be one of the most undeniable principles of 
government, that the truest policy of a nation consists in the performance of its duties. The rights of nations are nothing more 
than an extension of the rights of individuals to the great societies, 
into which the different portions of mankind have been combined ; 
and they are all mediately or immediately derived from the fundamental position which the author of Christianity has taught 
us as an article of religion, and which the revised declaration of 
rights of the National Convention in France have declared, to contain the essence of liberty. "Liberty," says the new Declaration of 
Rights, "consists in the power of doing whatever is not contrary to the 
rights of others ." "Whatsoever," says the Saviour of mankind, "you 
would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them. " Let us 
therefore be cautious to do nothing contrary to the rights of others, 
and we shall continue to enjoy and to deserve the blessings of 
freedom. Let us do as we should choose others might do to us, and we shall deserve the favors of Heaven. 
</p><p>
If these are the principles upon which our national conduct is to 
be grounded, it will follow, that an impartial and unequivocal 
neutrality between the contending parties is prescribed to us as 
a duty, unless we are bound by some existing contract or stipulation, to make a common cause with one of them. 
</p><p>
I have already said it : The natural state of all nations, with 
respect to one another, is a state of peace damus petimusque vicissim : It is what we have a right to expect from them, and 
for the same reason it is our duty to observe it towards them. In 
addition to this natural obligation, we are bound by express 
treaties with France, England, Holland and Prussia, to observe 
the laws of peace with the subjects of their different governments, 
and we have no right to interfere in their contentions. What 
ever may be the current of our sentiments, or of our opinions ; 
whatever may be the language suggested by our passions, 
or the wishes inspired by our affections, we are not constituted 
judges of the respective merits of their cause. From a feeling of 
gratitude towards a nation which assisted us in the days of our 
own calamity, we may be disposed to throw a veil over their own 
errors and crimes, and wish them that success which their frantic 
enthusiasm has rendered so improbable. As the descendants of 
Englishmen, we may be willing to lose the memory of all the miseries 
they inflicted upon us in our just struggle against them, and even 
the relics of their resentment, which still refuse the complete fulfilment of the treaty of peace, and we may wish them still to retain 
their reputation for successful courage and conduct in war. As 
men, we must undoubtedly lament the effusion of human blood, 
and the mass of misery and distress which is preparing for the 
great part of the civilized world ; but as the citizens of a nation 
at a vast distance from the continent of Europe; of a nation 
whose happiness consists in a real independence, disconnected 
from all European interests and European politics, it is our duty to 
remain, the peaceable and silent, though sorrowful spectators of 
the sanguinary scene. 
</p><p>
With the reasons for neutrality suggested by these considerations of natural duty and of positive stipulation, a forcible argument concurs, derived from our interest. In the general conduct 
of all the commercial European nations, the advantages which 
will be thrown into our hands, and the activity and vigor which 
will be given to every branch of our commerce, are too obvious 
to need any discussion. As the natural consequence of war, the 
necessities of all the belligerent powers must increase in proportion 
as their means of supply will dimmish, and the profits, which 
must infallibly flow to us from their wants, can have no other 
limitation than the extent of our capacity to provide for them. 
</p><p>
With all these inducements to a decided neutrality, let us look 
at the other side of the medal, and see what would be the consequence of our making ourselves partisans of the contest. First, 
we should be engaged in a quarrel, with the laws of nations against 
us. It would be a violation of our political duties ; a departure 
from the principles of national justice, and an express breach of the 
positive stipulations of peace and friendship with the several 
belligerent powers, contained in the treaties which I have already 
mentioned. An act of partiality in favor of either party would 
be an act of perfidy to the other. 
</p><p>
I have so full a confidence in the equity and virtue of my countrymen, that I should rest the argument on this point, if I had 
not perceived that a contrary system of policy is avowed by men 
of some influence among us, and openly recommended in some of 
the public prints of the day. A system, which professing to arise 
from an extraordinary attachment to the cause of Liberty and 
Equality, may in reality be traced to the common sources of 
private avarice, and private ambition, perhaps at once the cause 
and effect of an implicit devotion to France, and an antipathy to 
England, exceeding the limits of a national resentment. 
</p><p>
To men of this description, arguments derived from the obligations of natural justice, or of written contract will be perfectly 
nugatory. "The Rights of Man," will be their answer to the one, 
and "Liberty and Equality," to the other. I apply, therefore, 
to a principle of more efficacious operation in their minds, if their 
own interest is in any degree connected with that of their country, 
and ask them what would be the inevitable consequence of a war 
with all Europe, excepting only the present prevailing power of 
France? The experience of the late war, would perhaps discourage an attempt on the part of Great Britain to conquer this 
</p><p>

Continent, but we have a sea-coast of twelve hundred miles every 
where open to invasion, and where is the power to protect it? 
We have a flourishing commerce, expanding to every part of the 
globe, and where will it turn when excluded from every market of 
the earth? We depend upon the returns of that commerce for 
many necessaries of life, and when those returns shall be cut off, 
where shall we look for the supply? We are in a great measure 
destitute of the defensive apparatus of war, and who will provide 
us with the arms and ammunition that will be indispensable? We 
feel severely at this moment, the burden of our public debt, and 
where are the funds to support us in the dreadful extremity to 
which our own madness and iniquity would reduce us? Not 
to mention the infallible destruction of our finances, and the national bankruptcy, which the friends of the system I am combating, 
would perhaps welcome as a blessing. Are these, Sir, imaginary 
apprehensions, or are they objects of trivial moment? Our 
national existence may depend upon the event of our councils in 
the present crisis, and to advise us to engage voluntarily in the 
war, is to aim a dagger at the heart of the country. 
</p><p>
It has been inquired by citizens anxious for the welfare of the 
country, and aware of the distress to which it must inevitably 
be reduced by an European war, whether we have not already 
pledged our faith so far as to preclude us from any present consideration of convenience or inconvenience, and whether we are 
not by our own voluntary engagement bound to take the part of 
the present government in France, especially in case the West 
India islands should be attacked by Great Britain. 
</p><p>
By the eleventh article of the Treaty of Alliance with France, 
the United States "guaranty to his most Christian Majesty, the 
possessions of the crown of France in America." But the course 
of human events has either totally absolved us, or at least suspended the obligation of this clause, and it cannot be made even 
a plausible pretext for involving us in the present war. My reasons for this opinion are, 
</p><p>
1. That the guaranty is to his most Christian Majesty, of the 
possessions of the crown of France. I ask, who is at this time his 
most Christian Majesty? A part of the French nation, and all 
the other powers of Europe will answer, he is the son or the brother 
of the late Louis the XVIth. The National Convention, and the 
present republic of France will say there is no such man. The 
office and all its powers have been extinguished in the blood of the 
person with whom your contract was made. If the article binds 
us to either of the parties, the question which of the two is entitled 
to claim the performance, is now a question to be settled by the 
event of a civil war, and neither party can call upon us to decide 
it for them. 
</p><p>
2. That supposing the revolutions of France are now completed, 
and a republic firmly established, it may be doubtful whether they 
have not by their change of government, dissolved this clause of 
the treaty : I know it is a general principle of the laws of nations, 
that the rights and obligations of treaties survive the internal 
revolutions of government, and therefore that the republic of 
France may be entitled to the benefits of engagements contracted 
with the former Monarch. But to this rule there are many 
exceptions; the first Constituent Assembly were so fully of this 
opinion that they thought the nation absolved from all such 
treaties previously made, as might be injurious to their interests, 
and the present government have extended the principle much 
further, when [as] a justification for opening the Scheldt, contrary to 
the positive and express stipulation of many treaties, they have 
formally denied the obligation of any compact, which was contrary to the natural Rights of Men. Upon speculative principles 
it may be very questionable how far the sovereign control of a 
French Republic, over islands at three thousand miles distance from 
them is consistent with such natural rights, and it would be difficult to mark the distinction which should prohibit every act of 
jurisdiction exercised by one nation over a river flowing through 
the territories of another, and at the same time allow a supreme 
authority over colonies placed by the hand of nature at so wide a 
distance from the metropolis. The possessions of the crown of 
France, as guaranteed by our Treaty to his most Christian Majesty 
appear to me to have formed a part of that Constitution of government which then existed in France ; they were a part of the monarchy, and under the new government they can no longer be 
considered as possessions, in the same sense in which they were understood when the United States bound themselves to the guaranty. 
</p><p>
3. Should both of those ground for the opinion I am supporting 
be considered as erroneous, and the clause in question be held as 
binding us to the French Republic, in the same manner as it 
formerly did to the King, it remains to inquire what was intended 
by the guaranty, and what are the duties which it has prescribed 
to us? During the administration of the royal government, had 
the authority of the sovereign been guided by the maxims of 
speculative freedom or of practical tyranny; had he provoked 
a rebellion in the islands, by oppressing the planters or by liberat 
ing their slaves ; the guaranty in the treaty would not have bound 
us to assist him with our blood and treasures, in enforcing an 
absurd and unnatural Government against the perpetual resistances which it would necessarily provoke. Had the late King of 
France, like other kings of whom we read in history, veiling his 
insatiate ambition, under some specious pretence of glory, of 
dignity or of safety, declared a wanton and unjustifiable war 
against any or all of the commercial nations in Europe, and had 
his possessions in America been conquered by his enemies in the 
course of such a war, he never could have called upon the United 
States by virtue of this guaranty, to repair the injuries of his 
folly, and to sacrifice themselves in support of his pernicious 
projects. It is unnecessary to fatigue the public with the pedantry 
of quotations from the writers upon natural and political Law, 
but it may be laid down as an universal principle, that no stipulation contained in a treaty, can ever oblige one nation to adopt 
or support the folly or injustice of another. In applying this 
principle, it becomes necessary to observe, that the administration of the French government over their colonies, since the first 
revolution of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1789">1789</a> has been such as to keep almost all their islands 
in a constant state of rebellion and civil war; by the former of 
these calamities the slaves have been united against their masters; 
by the latter the masters have been divided against each other. 
From the chaotic mass of human passions, a collection of all the 
most violent and inflammable elements has been selected and 
combined together; the torch of the furies has been applied to the 
composition ; and the miserable islanders have been the victims of 
the fatal explosion. 
</p><p>
To such a state of desperation have these devoted colonies been 
reduced, that a formal deputation, as we are informed by the public 
papers, have solicited for them the protection of the British 
government ; and we are now told that this protection has been 
promised; that the King of Great Britain has agreed to take 
possession of those colonies and to hold them in trust for his most 
Christian Majesty, the power to whom the letter of our guaranty 
has promised the assistance of the United States. An arbitrary 
and oppressive system of administration compelled us to renounce 
the authority of Great Britain, and France assisted us to maintain our honorable warfare. A similar evil has driven some of 
the French colonies to a similar remedy; one of them has even 
attempted a Declaration of Independence, and all the others would 
doubtless have done the same, were they not profoundly sensible 
that the time is not yet come, for the Lion to lie down with the 
Lamb, and that the justice of their cause would avail them but 
little against the powerful injustice of their oppressors. But 
surely there would be something singularly absurd and iniquitous, 
to see the United States support the French in a plan of oppressive 
administration over their colonies, as a reward for rescuing them 
from the oppression of Great Britain. It would be such a total 
subversion of all moral and political consistency, such a covenant between virtue and vice, such a coalition of liberal freedom with despotic tyranny, as can scarcely be imagined without a 
confusion of ideas, or expressed without an absurdity of language. 
4. The last ground upon which I consider this guaranty as 
dissolved or at least suspended, is, that by the act of the French 
government, it has been rendered impracticable. They have 
declared war against all the naval powers of Europe. What the 
event of that war will be, it is not given to man to foretell ; but 
we cannot take a part with the French Republic, without uniting 
all the rest of Europe against us ; which upon every rational calculation of probability, would be dooming ourselves to inevitable 
ruin and destruction. We are therefore commanded by a law, 
which supercedes all others, by that uncontrolable law of nature, 
which is paramount to all human legislation, or compact, to remain 
at peace, and to content ourselves with wishing that laureled Vic 
tory may sit upon the sword of justice, and that smooth success 
may always be strewed before the feet of virtuous Freedom.
