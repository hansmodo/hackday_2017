SIR : Your letter of the 24th January has been some days in my hands, and I have been searching but in vain 
for something to enlighten me as to the nature of the action which you would propose to bring against Wilkins, 
etc. No objection, however, occurs to me against making the assignment you ask. When you shall inform me of 
the grounds of the proposed suit, if they shall appear to me to be well founded, and not calculated to produce a 
reaction on myself, it is probable I may accede to your wishes without delay, not, however, with any reservation of an interest as you have proposed. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your obedient, <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="me">A. BURR</a>.
