Yesterday I walked from Danbury to this place twenty long miles in company with Mr. Cabot and two other 
gentlemen. I am now within about six miles of our head quarters at North Castle, where, I am here informed, <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel=''>General Heath</a> is arrived, and is to command. My regiment, 
with a number of other Massachusetts regiments, are ordered to North Castle. In my next, perhaps, I shall be able to tell 
you something of our operations. God grant us success, and restore me with honor to my beloved.
