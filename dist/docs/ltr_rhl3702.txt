Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of addressing you last, by my 
eldest son, who went to camp about four weeks ago. 
Since that, we have had the pleasure of hearing that 
your advances against York go successfully on. By 
this time, I hope his Lordship begins seriously to 
repent the Quixote part that he has been acting 
in America. Surely the rage of despotism must be 
cooled by the total defeat of those great hopes, which 
have been entertained of southern conquest; though 
really, in all the outrages of passion that history presents, we see nothing equal to the tyrannous and 
senseless rancor of the British Iving and counsels 
against America. 
</p><p>
This disposition may continue a hopeless, ruinous 
war. I see that Arnold, in the true spirit of apostasy, is burning and wasting his native country. The 
malice of that man, his wickedness, and his avarice, render him a fit instrument for such employers. His former success in this State, his restless search after 
gain, however obtained, and the general languor that 
will be found here after the present exertions are over, will most likely be persuasives with General Clinton and himself, to cause the coming of this unprincipled person, with his fifteen hundred or two 
thousand plunderers, to Virginia, when the fleet and 
army shall be gone. The learned and judicious Polybius was of opinion, that the principal inducing motive of Alexander the Great for invading Persia, was 
the little resistance that the ten thousand Grecians met with in passing through that great empire. 
Weakness, joined with the possession of property, are certainly strong temptations to ambitious, avaricious men.

How best to prevent <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> from experiencing, 
in November, the same disgraceful visit that it did 
in January, your wisdom can best determine. Perhaps two strong frigates, under protection of a small 
and well-fortified garrison, at the town of York, with 
General Spotswood's and Colonel Mead's legion, made 
complete by the addition of some regular soldiers, 
might operate to discourage such attempts, with the 
force that can be prudently spared from the garrisons 
of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> ; or, if attempted, might 
be able, with militia aid, to repel the invaders. 
</p><p>
It is not easy to conceive the distress and injury 
that have been derived to this State from the number 
of piratical plunderers, that have infested the shores 
of this country since our galleys were laid down; 
and such have been the success and benefit attending 
this wicked practice, that we hear of small crews 
forming to go plundering along the shores. In the 
actual state of our affairs, it will be long before we 
can build and fit vessels to stop these pernicious and 
disgraceful practices. But I should suppose, that our 
government might have credit enough to purchase, 
from among the captured armed vessels at York, some ready-fitted, swift-sailing cruisers, for the purpose of scouring our Bay and rivers, and suppressing 
these piratical proceedings. If such a plan should 
meet your Excellency's approbation, your recommendation of it will secure its adoption. I know there 
will be difficulty in getting seamen. But, since the 
security of our country renders marine defence indispensable, and since the single difficulty of getting 
seamen is far less than getting them and building 
and fitting vessels besides, it would seem prudent to 
get the vessels, and diligently apply at the ports of 
neighbouring States for a few good seamen, less than 
a third of which description, with the rest landsmen, 
would well answer our purpose. I cannot help thinking that this method, aided by a well-conceived law 
for the speedy capital punishment of such offenders, 
would contribute to lessen greatly, if not to suppress, 
a practice extremely injurious to those who live near 
the water, and destructive to the commerce of the 
State. 
</p><p>
We are anxiously waiting for the rejoicing time to 
come, when Lord Cornwallis and his people will be 
your prisoners. I am, dear Sir, with particular esteem. 
</p><p>
Your affectionate and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
