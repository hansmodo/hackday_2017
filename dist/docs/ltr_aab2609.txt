MY DEAR SIR: You may take it an ill compliment that I tell you I am heartily glad to hear of your arrival. 
<a href="/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin">Mr. Alston</a> and Mr. Neville successively made attempts to see you at the tavern, but were denied. Having this 
minute heard that you have gone to my late quarters, I send to inquire of your health, of that of Mrs. Blennerhassett's, and in what I can be useful to you. What counsel shall I send you ? 
</p><p>
Faithfully yours, <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="me">A. BURR</a>.

<a href="/results.php?tla=hnb" rel="met colleague">H. BLENNERHASSETT</a>, ESQ.
