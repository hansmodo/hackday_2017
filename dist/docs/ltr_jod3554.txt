MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
WE have received from Congress a resolution by 
which we are to be empowered to negotiate a treaty of 
commerce with Great Britain, myself, <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Franklin</a> 
and <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>. This will detain me in Europe this 
winter. If this letter arrive in season that you can 
come to me this fall with Miss Abby, I shall be supremely happy to see you. But still things are so 
unsettled in Congress that you may expect to return 
with me in the spring. You may come to <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, 
<a href='/results.php?city=amsterdam' rel='city'>Amsterdam</a>, or L Orient, to either of which places I 
will soon go to receive you after hearing of your arrival. 
</p><p>
It is, however, attended with so many inconveniences that I must submit it to your discretion, with 
the advice of your friends, whether to come this fall, 
or stay till spring and then come, in case things 
should not be so altered as to oblige me to come home 
then to you. I have written more fully by Mr. Thaxter, who sails the 20th of this month from L Orient, 
in the French packet to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. If you come, 
leave the boys at their school. Bring a maid and a 
man servant. Leave the place in the care of Dr. 
Tufts or your father. John is well. 
</p><p>
Yours unfailingly, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='me'>J. ADAMS</a>.
