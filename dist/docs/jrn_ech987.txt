We have had the wind from every quarter of the compass, as well as a few hours' perfect calm with considerable rain, hail and snow, giving us an opportunity to gather rainwater, which all were eager to do. I was successful in obtaining about three gallons of good sweet water, fit for any purpose, besides as much as I could drink. A good drink of
water is much more eagerly sought after by us than brandy by the most devoted followers of Bacchus.

Ten or twelve large albatross were caught and slaughtered, some of them weighing 22 pounds and measuring as much as 12 feet across the wings from tip to tip. Every one now has a curiosity of some kind or other from these fine birds. The ladies picked the feathers off several of them and took the skin off with the down on, which is very thick, for the purpose of making tippets. Some have secured the skins to be sent home and put up; others a few large quills; the bill; a long, slender bone out of the wing which answers as a pipestem; the skin of the foot filled with wind like a bladder, which after becoming dry serves the purpose of a tobacco pouch. We enjoyed a first-rate supper on stewed albatross and had a lot of dried apples stewed with a portion of the rainwater caught. Notwithstanding the fact that the seamen all told us the albatross were not edible, we devoured them as if they were pheasants, not experiencing any ill effects therefrom.

The wind eventually settled in the southwest and we glided smoothly toward the north. On Wednesday we had incessant rain squalls. In the afternoon we quite unexpectedly came within sight of Cape Three Points, the first land we have seen since the 29th of October. This sudden approach to land somewhat alarmed the Captain, for it proved to him that his reckoning was wrong. At the announcement of land in sight all hands were soon on deck scanning the horizon with eager eyes. A squall coming up at the time prevented them from discovering it at first, but soon the cloud disappeared and a glorious light burst upon the view. A great
number of snow-clad high hills or mountains far inland appeared as bright and shining as gold when the sun reflected his rays upon it. Soon after, the mist entirely disappeared in that direction and the table-lands presented themselves before us as far as the eye could reach, as well as the rocks and breakers near the shore. We were driven by the very heavy rolling sea, quite near these rocks that reared their dark peaks above the surface, and against which the waves lashed themselves into a foam. As the afternoon advanced and evening came on, the Captain became more apprehensive of danger and every effort was made to get off from shore, when a sudden squall of wind came up from a favorable quarter. The Captain ordered on more sail and we were soon speeding our way out of danger which the officers told us was much more imminent than most of us anticipated. Indeed, they said death and destruction threatened all round.

Saturday the wind commenced blowing with great violence. The ocean rolled in mountain waves and its whole surface was covered with foam. The gale was so violent that it carried away our spanker sheet and rolled over us in such a manner as almost to sweep-our decks. The seamen began to be alarmed and the passengers put on very long faces. Many did not retire during the night, and others turned in with their clothes on. I, however, turned in about ten and slept very soundly until breakfast, notwithstanding the tremendous knocks the old craft received. When we waked up we found ourselves becalmed and a smooth sea spread around us, but a light breeze arose and wafted us onward to our promised port.

This is the first day, I believe, for five weeks, that
we have had no rain or snow. At daylight the highest peaks of Cape Three Mounts could be seen to the east. The greenish appearance of the water told us we were upon soundings, where the water is very deep.

One of the seamen now lies very feeble with the scurvy.
