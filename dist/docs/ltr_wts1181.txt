Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
As to politics, I hardly know if I should approach 
Grant, as I can hardly judge of the influences that have 
operated on him since we were together last November. 
In accepting the acting office of Secretary of War, I 
doubt not he realized the delicacy of his position, and 
was willing to risk the chances. It is not for the interest of the United States that in a temporary political 
office he should sink his character as a military officer. 
In the former he should be in harmony with the executive, but in the latter he should be simply a high sheriff 
to execute the process of the court. My belief is that 
Congress cannot qualify the President's right to command the army and navy. He is the Constitutional 
Commander-in-Chief. But Congress can make rules and 
laws for the government of the army and thereby control 
the President as such Commander-in-Chief. In trying 
to array the President and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> in antagonism, Congress did wrong, and reaction is sure to result. 
It damages all parties, because few people take the 
trouble to study out the right, yet time moves along so 
rapidly and the election of a new President will soon 
settle these and all kindred questions. Your course 
has been fair, and you cannot wish to alter or amend it. 
Our country ought not to be ruled by the extreme views 
of Sunmer or Stevens any more than by the extreme 
views of Calhoun, Yancey, etc., that have produced our 
Civil War. There is some just middle course, and events 
will flow into it whether any one man or set of men is 
wise enough to foresee it and lay down its maxims. I 
think Chase is the ablest man of his school, and I would 
personally prefer him to Wade, Colfax, or any of the 
men whose names I notice in this connection. Whether 
the precedent of a Chief Justice being a political aspirant may not be bad, I don't know. This is the Mexican 
rule, and has resulted in anarchy.

I don't think Grant, Sheridan, Thomas, or any real 
military man wants to be President. All see that, however pure or exalted their past reputations may have 
been, it don't shield them from the lies and aspersions of 
a besotted press. . . . Grant writes me in the most unreserved confidence, and never has said a word that looks 
like wanting the office of President. His whole nature 
is to smooth over troubles, and he waits with the most 
seeming indifference, under false and unjust assertions, 
till the right time, when the truth peeps out, so as to 
defy contradiction. . . .

Affectionately,
