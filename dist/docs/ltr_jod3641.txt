BIV DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>

I must wait to know whether Congress will do any 
thing or not to furnish my house. If they do not, I 
will have no house before next fall, and then a very 
moderate one, with very moderate furniture.

The prisoners from Algiers arrived yesterday in 
this city, in good health and looking very well. Captain Stevens is among them. One woman rushed 
into the crowd and picked out her husband whom she 
had not seen for fourteen years.

I am, and ever shall be, yours and no other's,
