Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
We have now been near two months on the Indian 
Commission, and I can pretty closely judge of the result. 
It cannot be complete or final, because it will take years 
to do all the law requires, and I suppose the pressure 
will force Congress to do something conclusive this winter. According to existing treaties with Indians, they 
have a right to wander and hunt across all the railroads 
toward the West, and Henderson thinks we had no right 
to locate roads through without a prior assent, and by 
the payment of damages. Whether right or wrong, those 
roads will be built, and everybody knows that Congress, 
after granting the charts and fixing the routes, cannot 
now back out and surrender the country to a few bands 
of roving Indians. Henderson says, also, that the demand of these railroads, stage, telegraph, and other lines 
on me for military aid or protection were not contemplated, but that these companies took their franchises and 
contracts with a full knowledge of the difficulties. Now 
I and all who have gone before me have acted on the 
general theory that when Congress located a road, that it 
amounted to an implied promise to give reasonable military protection. However, by the time Congress meets, 
we can, I think, submit to you some general plan that is 
practicable, and will in time not at once attain a 
result. . . .

Yours,
