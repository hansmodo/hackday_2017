Dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
I wrote you a day or two ago which letter I intended to send by the 
mail, which leaves to-day, & will do so, so that this will accompany it ; 
since closing it, the express got here from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a> bringing me your 
interesting letters of the 26th 28th  & 30th  ult but nothing beyond the 
Brasos 
</p><p>
As regards the taking possession of Tampico, I had rec d a report 
from Col Gates 1 after his arrival there in regard to the same stating that 
he had relieved the sailors & marines, left there to garrison it, which was 
all very well ; alth he communicates but little information of interest 
derived from the heroine of the Navy, or from any other source 
</p><p>
A copy of a letter from Commodore Perry to Majr Gardner, about 
the necessity of sending more troops parading before the eyes of no 
doubt the astonished Majr the great names of Governor Johnson, of 
Louisiana, & Gen ls Jesup & Brook, 1 to back his judgment in regard to 
this matter of such vital importance, which has given me a contemptable 
opinion of the Comm e as it was all to gloryfy himself in connection with 
his trip to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a>, for taking possession of a fortified place which he 
must have known was abandoned by the enemy some time before he 
went there, as the Mexican commander in chief, gave the order for 
doing so, which was published in the n. papers in the City of Mexico & 
rec d here near or quite a month since, but the " lord deliver me " from 
all locofocoes may I ever pray ;" but entertain a more contempable 
opinion of Brook & Jesup, the former however ought to be excused as 
being a mess of wax in the hands of the later, if they in any way advised, 
that the destination of the troops ordered here, or any portion of them, 
should be changed to Tampico, particularly the seven comp s of mounted 
Rifles under Majr Burbridge, or any portion of the recruits sent out for 
the Reg te here & in my advance, much less if either of those gentlemen 
took the responsibility of giving any orders to that effect, which I can 
hardly suppose was the case ; as to Gov r Johnson as a matter of course 
he would acquiesce in any suggestions as regarded the subject in question, which the individuals referred to would make, not understanding 
anything about it. It is impossible operations of a successful character 
can be carried on against the enemy if orders are given by irresponsible 
individuals in my rear & the destination of troops changed ordered out 
to reenforce me without my knowledge or authority. This Tampico 
affair seems to have turned the heads of most of those in authority in 
my rear between this & <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a>, including Gen Patterson ; Mr. 
Marcy s having been in that state for some time past. Well might 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> dread a fire in his rear, with such people to do with. I consider Gates com d was fully sufficient for the safety of Tampico, yet I 
ordered him to be reenforced by two additional comp s of artillery Normans & Vannesses, & a Reg { of Volunteers ; I look on that place as of 
no consequence unless there is a road from it for wheel carriages to San 
Luis Potisi, or to the City of Mexico over which an army could operate, 
which from all the information I have been able to collect, I am inclined 
to believe is not the case, notwithstanding I intend to have that matter 
fully ascertained by our Topographical engineers ; if found to be impracticable the best thing which could be done with Tampico, would be to destroy the fortifications & abandon it, leaving one of our small armed 
vessels to prevent any intercourse with it by Sea. On the contrary, if a 
practicable ro?.d should be found from it to either of the named places it 
will be of great importance both as a dep & base to operate from. 
Otherwise the services of every man left there would be pretty much 
thrown away whether we march against San Louis, or go to Vera Cruz, 
for if the first should be taken Tampico would have fallen as a matter 
of course.

I wish those authorised to do so, to inform me so far as my com 
mand is concerned, or those placed under my orders as to what they wish 
done, after which let there be no improper interference at Washington or 
between there & my h d Qu s 
</p><p>
On the subject of the request of the artillery Compy of Newport 
Road Island, I would very gladly comply with their wishes if I felt 
authorized to do so ; but as that was not the case, I have refferred the 
matter to the dep recommending in strong terms that the application 
should be favorably acted on, which I hope will be the case 
</p><p>
I make no doubt Jesup come out to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> to be ready to 
take advantage of any thing which might occur to give him a com d here, 
or any thing else that he could make capital out of; he has been angling 
all his life for popularity, in more ways than one ; the idia attempted to 
be played off on the community, that he come out to attend to the duties 
of his dept will do for some who do not understand him ; but those that 
know him are aware that was a mere pretext ; But be all this as it may, I 
have not the slightest objection to his or any one else being assigned to a 
command here, if they should supersede me 
</p><p>
I have no doubt many of Webs 1 statements as communicated to 
him by Cass, are entirely correct, particularly as to the course of the 
administration in regard to appointments, both civil & military, they must 
& will all be made from the dominant party. If John succeeds in get 
ting into the Navy, it must be through political influence, & Ann must 
hold Col Tibbatts to his promise, who is a good locofoco or was, & no 
doubt can have him appointed if he will make an application to that 
effect which I make no doubt he will do if reminded of the same. I 
have been detained here several days longer than I calculated on, but will 
leave early to-morrow morning for Linares Victoria &c, part of the 
command having left yesterday for those places, & the balance this morning. Nothing new from our front or in fact from any other quarter 
</p><p>
In commencing my letter after writing over the first side of the 
sheet, by a mistake being very much interrupted I skipped by mistake 
the other side which is left blank, but continued on the next which is 
numbered, so that you will find no difficulty in making it out 
</p><p>
Col Taylor left here about two weeks since in quite feeble health, I 
feel very uneasy about him. Wishing you & yours continued health & 
prosperity I remain truly & sincerely
