My young friend Stokely Hays, the son of a respectable old revolutionary officer, will hand you this, and will bring me your reply. I have 
experienced distressing delays ; but shall be at the mouth of the Cumberland on the 23d, Sunday. Please to repair thither. Enter on the east 
(upper) side of the island, which lies in the mouth of the river. I anticipate impatiently the pleasure of meeting you.
