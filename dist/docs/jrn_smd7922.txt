AM I not glad to get another blank book ! On Sunday my old one gave out, to my unspeakable distress, and I would have been <em>desolee</em> if I had not had three 
or four letters to answer, as writing is my chief occupation during my tedious illness. O that unfortunate 
trip to Port Hudson ! Have I not cause to remember and regret it? Two months last Sunday since I have 
been lying here a cripple, and I am not yet able to take a step. However, on Monday mother sent Dr. Woods as my fourth physician, and I have made up 
my mind that either he or Nature will effect a cure before long. Wonder how it feels to walk? It makes 
me weary to see others try it; I always fear that the exertion must be very painful an absurd idea which I endeavor to keep to myself. . . .
