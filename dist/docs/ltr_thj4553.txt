Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter of May the 29th to the President of the United 
States has been duly received. You have placed their proposition of exchanging a minister on proper ground. It must 
certainly come from them, and come in unequivocal form. 
With those who respect their own dignity so much, ours must 
not be counted at nought. On their own proposal, formerly, 
to exchange a minister, we sent them one. They have taken 
no notice of that, and talk of agreeing to exchange one now, 
as if the idea were new. Besides, what they are saying to 
you, they are talking to us through <a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a> ; but so informally, that they may disavow it when they please. It would 
only oblige them to make the fortune of the poor Major, whom 
they would pretend to sacrifice. Through him, they talk of a 
minister, a treaty of commerce, and alliance. If the object of 
the latter be honorable, it is useless ; if dishonorable, inadmissible. These tamperings prove, that they view a war as very 
possible ; and some symptoms indicate designs against the Spanish possessions adjoining us. The consequences of their 
acquiring all the country on our frontier, from the St Croix to 
the St Mary s, are too obvious to you, to need developement. 
You will readily see the dangers which would then environ us. 
</p><p>
We wish you, therefore, to intimate to them, that we cannot 
be indifferent to enterprises of this kind. That we should 
contemplate a change of neighbors with extreme uneasiness ; 
and that a due balance on our borders is not less desirable to 
us, than a balance of power in Europe has always appeared to 
them. We wish to be neutral, and we will be S6, if they will 
execute the treaty fairly, and attempt no conquests adjoining 
us. The first condition is just ; the second imposes no hard 
ship on them. They cannnot complain, that the other dominions of Spain would be so narrow as not to leave them room 
enough for conquest. If the war takes place, we would really 
wish to be quieted on these two points, offering in return an 
honorable neutrality. More than this, they are not to expect. 
It will be proper that these ideas be conveyed, in delicate and 
friendly terms ; but that they be conveyed, if the war takes 
place ; for it is in that case alone, and not till it be begun, that 
we would wish our dispositions to be known. But in no case, 
need they think of our accepting any equivalent for the posts. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem. 
Dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,
