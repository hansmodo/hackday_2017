My dear General, 
</p><p>
In revolving in my mind the chances of discovery 
by moonlight, and, on the other hand, the inconveniences of staying longer than you wish under our 
tents, I have thought if there was any position which 
might enable us to take advantage of the first hours 
of the night. How far the sending of the Pennsylvanians towards Aquakanac, and going ourselves to 
the Hackensac position, may awaken the enemy, I 
cannot pretend to say. The most difficult affair in 
this, would be the article of the boats. Colonel Smith 
will go to-morrow morning to <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, unless any 
intelligence received at head-quarters had made it 
useful that the enterprise be attempted soon, in which 
case he would go and reconnoitre the place. Suppose 
he was to bring from <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a> Colonel Gouvion, 
who has often examined the place with the eye of 
an engineer. These ideas, my dear General, have 
rather started into my mind than become fixed, anu 
I thought I would communicate them. 
</p><p>
Most affectionately and respectfully yours, 
</p><p>

P. S. The Marquis de Laval Montmorency, one 
of the most illustrious families in France, is on liis 
way to the camp. The Chevalier de Chastellux, a 
relation and friend of mine, Major-General in the 
French army, is also coming. I every day expect 
my brother-in-law, and his friend, Count de Charlus, 
only son to the Marquis de Castries, who enjoys a 
great consideration in France, and has won the battle 
of Closter Camp. The duke of Lauzun has also 
written to me that he would come soon. These five 
gentlemen may, by their eminence at home, be considered as the first people in the French army. This 
little history I give you before their arrival, in consequence of what you have desired from me at the 
beginning. 
</p><p>
I write some letters to the Commanding Officers at 
<a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>, <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, and King's Ferry, so that the 
gentlemen may be directed to come by the best road 
to my quarters, from which I will present them to 
you. I think the letters ought to be sent as soon 
as possible. 
</p><p>
As <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='colleague met'>General Heath</a> commands in all these parts, I 
think, upon recollection, that I had better write to 
him alone. You might also send him a line on the 
subject.
