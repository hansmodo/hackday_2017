My Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>:--Your truly welcome letter dated May 24th arrived in West Chester July 9th, and was gladly received by me. Do not do me injustice and judge me wrongly. If you do not receive answers to your letters, you may conclude they are somewhere between West Chester and California, for I always answer them by the return of the mail, and assure you of my devoted attachment. However, I hurt my finger and the doctor said I got cold in it, and so I had it in a sling for two weeks. But thank Providence, it is well so that I can write now.
</p><p>
I wish, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>, when you next write that you will tell me whether your feelings have changed any toward me. I have a great deal of sympathy for you, away from all your friends, in a foreign land, deprived of all the luxuries and nearly all the comforts of life. You must indeed feel badly when you do not receive a letter. You are always in my mind. I think of you through the day and dream of you by night, sometimes seeing you in the gold mines and sometimes upon the sea.
</p><p>
Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>, you have made every effort to obtain gold. You have failed in the effort. Be not disheartened. Riches taketh wings and flies away but happiness no one can take away from us. I repeat what I have said in all my letters, that it is not every man's luck to make
a fortune. If your health is improved and you have a safe return to your dearest friends, to have made the effort will perhaps be a lasting benefit and repay you for all your trouble. I have told you that a living can be made in Chester County and gold will not buy health nor happiness.
</p><p>
I guess poor Clint wishes he had never heard of the gold mines. Your description of your trip from Mariposa to your present situation is laughable but sad. It is easier to talk about than to endure. I don't know where you got nourishment or the cow either.

I requested you in my last letter to inquire if you could hear anything of Theodore and tell him that father and sister together have sent him 13 letters. My sister has written seven letters to him urging him to come home, but he has not received one of them. She says she is not uneasy about him while he has his health, but if he gets sick what is to become of him, without money or friends? We have had brother Theodore's portrait painted from his daguerreotype. It is most excellent.

There seems to be a great deal of excitement at this time. Professor Webster you know was sentenced to be hung for the murder of Doctor Parkman. He has pleaded his innocence until within a few days. He said he was innocent of the charge and called on God as searcher of all hearts to witness the truth of his statement. He now acknowledges the deed and says that Doctor Parkman insulted him and he flew in a passion and struck him one blow, which was fatal. He then took off his clothes and burnt them and cut the body up in pieces and burnt the head and buried the rest of the body in different places. If they don't hang him, no person ought ever to be hung for murder
for people always kill in a passion. That is no excuse.

Philadelphia has been visited by one of the worst fires that ever was there. Three hundred and sixty-four houses burned down and many lives were lost and many persons injured. The loss is more than a million of dollars. It commenced in a hay store in Water Street. In the upper part of the building was a quantity of powder and saltpetre, which soon made a terrible explosion, throwing wood, bricks, and everything up in the air and crushing men, women and children to the ground. It burnt every house in Water Street above Callowhill. It commenced at four o'clock in the afternoon and burnt until twelve at night. The scene was distressing. Women cried for their husbands and children, many of whom have not been heard of yet. We saw the light quite plainly here, twenty-five miles away. I have not been to see the ruins yet but I am very impatient to go.

Mr. Crowell, our Presbyterian minister, is going to leave us. He has had a louder call in New Jersey. Here he gets four hundred and fifty dollars and there he is to get nine hundred and house rent free.

The country has lost her best friend, and a great and good man. President Taylor died July the 9th.
</p><p>
I believe there is nothing more at present. I remain
</p><p>
Yours truly and sincerely,
</p><p>
