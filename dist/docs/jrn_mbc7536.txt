<a rel='month origin' value='2'>February</a> <a rel='day origin' value='28'>28th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=montgomery' rel='city origin'>MONTGOMERY</a>, Ala., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. In the drawing-room a literary lady began a violent attack upon this mischief-making South 
Carolina. She told me she was a successful writer in the magazines of the day, but when I found she used " incredible " for " incredulous," I said not a word in defense of 
my native land. I left her incredible. Another person came in, while she was pouring upon me her home troubles, 
and asked if she did not know I was a Carolinian. Then she gracefully reversed her engine, and took the other tack, 
sounding our praise, but I left her incredible and I remained incredulous, too.

Brewster says the war specks are growing in size. Nobody at the North, or in Virginia, believes we are in ear 
nest. They think we are sulking and that Jeff Davis and Stephens are getting up a very pretty little comedy. The Virginia delegates were insulted at the peace conference; 
Brewster said, " kicked out."

The Judge thought Jefferson Davis rude to him when the latter was Secretary of War. Mr. Chesnut persuaded the Judge to forego his private wrong for the pub 
lic good, and so he voted for him, but now his old grudge 
has come back with an increased venomousness. What a 
pity to bring the spites of the old Union into this new one ! 
It seems to me already men are willing to risk an injury to 
our cause, if they may in so doing hurt Jeff Davis.
