DEAR MARY--We are now within three days of Lawson's Settlement, in the Valley of the Sacramento; and if a bird was ever rejoiced to escape its thraldom, I shall be much more so to get to the end of this long, weary, and vexatious journey. A man deserves to be well paid who makes his first overland journey to California, for he can form no idea of the many trials he may be subjected to. The fatigues of the journey--the hardships of traversing an almost barren wilderness of nearly two thousand miles, I care but little for; but it is the narrow-minded ribaldry--the ceaseless strife which is constantly marring the tranquility of such a crowd--a mass of men in which each individual acts independent of all the rest, caring for none but himself, which renders it almost insufferable.

We have reached this point without accident to ourselves or our cattle, a somewhat extraordinary thing considering what we have passed through, but it has been accomplished only by the utmost vigilance and care on our part. We have been nearly three weeks longer on the road than we expected or should have been, but for circumstances When we were going down the Humboldt River, a report began to be accredited among the emigrants that there was a new road that led to Feather River, or the Sacramento, or the somewhere, that it was an hundred miles nearer to the mines, a better route, no difficulty in crossing the mountains (Sierra Nevada), and plenty of grass and water all the way, and that we should not have to cross the barren desert of the Great Basin. We watched for days
for the turning-off place, and in the meantime various reports were circulated about the road, and we did not know what to believe. In fact nobody knew certain whether there was a road leading to California that way, though there was one to Oregon. In much doubt we finally came to the turning-off point and our company determined to take it anyhow, as there was forty-five miles of desert on the old road without grass or water; and a story became prevalent that when we got out ten miles on the new road, there was grass, in fifteen miles water and some grass, and after thirty-five miles there was good forage all the way. We took it--there was no grass for sixty-five miles and but one spring, a mile off the road, where water could be had for the cattle; in short, we were on the desert and drove the whole distance without feeding our cattle, and no water except at the commencement. Our train was the fourth that had taken the road, and I counted on the last thirty miles fifty oxen dead from exhaustion on the desert. Yet our cattle went through well. We then came to a large boiling spring which irrigated about twenty acres of land, and a little distance below the spring the water became cool enough for the cattle to drink. We lay here till 'most night and then moved to better and more grass seven miles beyond, where we lay over one day. There we had two twenty-mile stretches of desert to pass without grass or water, so that our no desert proved to be one hundred and five miles; yet we passed safely through and without loss, although many who followed us lost their cattle and had to abandon their wagons and pack through on foot. We now came to a tribe of very hostile Indians, like those we had been with on the Humboldt--they are a thieving set; they would come near at nightfall and either steal mules, horses, or cattle, or shoot them with arrows so that they could not be taken along, and then come in and get them after the emigrants are gone. We keep strict guard and save ours. We passed five hundred miles among the robbers; in fact, we are only two days beyond them. Some desperate encounters have been had between them and the whites, when in search of cattle or mules; for they fight well cornered, but run if they can. Yet I have been in the mountains alone by day and by night, have slept alone when the wolves have come howling within two rods of me, and have met with no trouble whatever from either Indians, robbers, or wolves; still, it was a risk. One gets used to it, and I have had no more fears in traveling alone, miles from any camp, than if I had been on a public road at home. We have seen many things I cannot speak of now, but have noticed them in my journal. At last we went northward till we met a government train going to the Humboldt with supplies for troops going in, and from them we learned that we should find a road just opened across the mountains to California, but that our route would be about three hundred miles farther than the one by the old road. We passed through a cañon twenty-five
miles This is a chasm wide enough for the road, and sometimes has considerable grass and wild oats growing in it. The country around is barren and rugged, the mountains impassable for wagons; but here Providence has opened this strange pass with perpendicular rocks three or four hundred feet high on each side. It is a great curiosity. Before we reached the pass we crossed the dry bed of a lake which was twenty miles long and five miles wide. Where we crossed the mountains it was by no means difficult; we were only a little over an hour in going over, and the hill is not any harder than many I have crossed in Pennsylvania. On the other side we descended to the valley that led to Goose Lake, which was salt and soda, the shores being lined with carbonate of soda for miles. A few miles below this we struck Pit River, the longest and principal branch of the Sacramento. This we followed down through a fine valley for a hundred miles, passing a hill of pure carbonate of magnesia fifty feet high. This was another great curiosity, for all that is required is to take out large and beautiful blocks with perfect ease. On leaving Pit River we came into pine forests, some of the trees two hundred feet high; and we are now crossing the mountains a hundred miles from Lawson's on the Sacramento, where we expect to be in three days. In consequence of our lengthened route our provisions are very low, and for ten days we have had nothing but hard bread and coffee, except now and then getting a poor, lean piece of beef, which some of the half-starved emigrants have killed. But my health is as good as it ever was, and I can endure any amount of fatigue. I have not slept in a tent for more than two months, and in these mountains the ice is a quarter of an inch thick every morning; I lay on the ground and stand it well. We still hear encouraging news from the mines, and have met some Oregon men on their way home. There is much distress among emigrants on the old road. The grass is gone, their provisions have failed, many cattle died; and on the forty-five-mile desert, I have learned that five hundred mules and oxen lay dead and the effluvia has made much sickness among the emigrants. Many with families of little children are suffering, and those behind on the Humboldt must suffer severely if not perish. The grass is now gone on either road and God only knows how the last trains can get along. Many will go to Salt Lake to winter, some to Oregon, and some cannot get to either place. Men on foot daily pass us who started with good outfits but have lost all and are now begging their way through, and all the wagons on this route have scarcely enough for themselves as it is. Some pass on mules, having left wagon and baggage, their mules being too weak to draw their loads, and yet it is worse on the old road. It may have been the best thing for us that we took this road, for, except the first sixty-five miles, we have not really suffered, and that we might have provided
against had we known of the desert, by taking along grass and water. I cannot tell you in a letter what I have seen or passed through; even a journal is too limited; yet what would look like hardship at home proves, on trial, to be no hardship after we get used to it. I have written you every chance, but there has been no sure one since I left Fort Laramie till Charles Fisher overtook us on the Humboldt. I wrote by him and entrusted him with my journal up to Fort Hall, as he was going direct to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jas" >Sutter's</a> and would mail them I am very anxious to hear from you; I have not heard a word from my friends since the day I left Ottawa. I shall write as often as possible, and shall not close this until I reach the settlements. We have not seen a house for four and a half months, and have passed through many scenes which I must leave to recount on my return. I have felt quite uneasy about you during the sickly season but hope to be assured of your health before long

September 17.--At length I am in the settlements. We had arrived to within a little over fifty miles of Lawson's, and the road lay over barren mountains, and it was necessary for our train to lay over a day or two at the last grass, and I concluded to walk on. Taking a shirt and tying the ends together to make a knapsack, I shouldered it, together with my blanket, water-bottle and tin cup, and set out about two o'clock p.m. The road was rocky and bad all the way, with long hills to go up and down, and water only at long intervals, and then in deep cañones (ravines) a mile from the road. I walked twelve miles and came up with a Missouri camp with whom I was acquainted, and they invited me to spend the night with them. This was the last water for twenty-two miles. In the morning I started on, and at noon kindled a fire among the tall pines of a dense forest and made a cup of coffee with some of the water in my flask. I was now on an elevated ridge one hundred feet high and in many places only wide enough for a road. This continued for sixteen miles, and at four o'clock I reached a watering place and went a mile down a precipice to fill my bottle--a very laborious task--and then went on two miles. Here I met Colonel Watkins, of whom I have spoken in my journal and with whom I have traveled a great deal He insisted on my taking up quarters with him for the night,
but his train had not one drop of water. From that in my flask we made a cup of tea and we were soon sleeping soundly on the ground. I preferred sleeping near a camp, for this forest swarms with grizzly bears and large wolves and panthers, their tracks being very frequent in the road. In the morning we had a very little tea from the water left, though two of his men walked four miles after night and got a pailful. I then walked eight miles, where I went down a still more steep precipice to a creek, kindled a fire and made another good cup of coffee, which revived me very much. About two o'clock I reached the Sacramento Valley, and at five I came in sight of the first house, belonging to Colonel Davis, of Tennessee It seemed strange to see habits of civilization again, and I hardly knew what to say or do when I reached it. A mile below was Lawson's, and the plain was dotted with tents, wagons, and cattle of the emigrants and those going to the gold mines from below. My first thought was for something to eat; I bought a pound of the best beef I ever saw, a pound of sugar, a quarter pound of cheese, four biscuits, and a little salt, then went to cooking and fared sumptuously. Flour is selling here at $50 per 100; beef 35c. per lb.; sugar, 50c.; cheese, $1.50 per lb. I paid 10c. for two tablespoons full of salt. These things are much cheaper at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jas" >Sutter's</a>, now called Sacramento City; but here they sell at any price, as emigrants come in hungry and destitute of provisions. My train will be in tonight or in the morning, and I think my first move will be to go to the city to raise some provisions. As for the prospects of mining, all agree that it ranges from eight to a thousand dollars per day. If you get a good place, a few hours will yield hundreds, perhaps thousands, but after getting the hang of the barn you are sure of eight dollars. This is the lowest that I have heard. Of course at this time I can say but little about it, but in the course of three or four weeks shall know more. There are various ways of making money, and my team will be worth a great deal to me either to haul loads or for beef. The latter is said to be worth a dollar per pound in the mines. If I go to the city I shall write to you from there. You will direct all letters to me to Sacramento City, where, I am told, there is a post office. From what I can learn at this early date the prospects are very encouraging, and I do not doubt of doing my share. It has been very sickly in the Valley, but the season is about over and we have got in about the right time.
</p><p>
This is nothing but a trading post of two families, Lawson and Davis. They live in low, mean, mud houses of unburnt brick ( adobe ).
</p><p>
My health never was better, and my ambition to be making something is equally as good. I shall soon write you again and I hope to know more of the gold region. I have been unable while on the road to write to any of my friends, but shall now embrace my first leisure to do so.
</p><p>
God bless you. I am

Affectionately yours,
