My hear Sir, 
</p><p>
The indisposition, and consequent absence from Mount 
Vernon, of my nephew, Major Washington, to whom the 
care of my private business is intrusted, makes it indispensably necessary for me to go home before the meeting 
of Congress. 
</p><p>
My stay there will be longer or shorter, according to circumstances ; but it cannot exceed the middle of October, as 
I must be back before the meeting of that body. 
</p><p>
Will you permit me, my dear sir, to make a similar 
request to the one I did last year, and to pray that your 
ideas may not be confined to matters merely judicial, but 
extended to all other topics which have, or may occur to 
you, as fit subjects for general or private communications. 
With sincere esteem and affectionate regard, 
I am, my dear sir, 
Your obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="me">George Washington<a/>.
