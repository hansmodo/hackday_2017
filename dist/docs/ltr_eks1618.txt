My last date was the seventeenth. Since then have 
had no time to continue my journal, but all I could 
have recorded of interest can be told in a few words. 
The siege has progressed slowly and neither party has as yet injured the other materially. The first parallel 
has been opened about eight hundred yards from the 
wall of the town. The point of attack being directly 
in front of us, our brigade, General Worth s, has performed most of the labor in the trenches, and furnished 
nearly all the guards for the working parties. I have 
been on picket guard six nights in eleven, and the 
duty has been exceedingly severe upon all. The sand 
insects and want of rest must soon break us down in 
this climate unless the duty becomes lighter. The 
enemy are using their heavy batteries incessantly, 
throwing some hundreds of solid shot and shells at 
us every day, yet but one man in our brigade has 
been struck, a marine, who was killed yesterday 
morning by a shot striking the wall of the cemetery 
behind which he was sitting. We owe our safety to 
the peculiar nature of the ground, all the distance 
from our camp to the trenches being a succession of 
high sand hills with valleys filled with chaparral in 
which we are entirely safe from all but vertical shot, 
the fragments of shells which burst in the air, and the 
chances are that not one in a thousand of them will 
be effective. 
</p><p>
Night before last I spent in advance of the trenches 
not far from the town. It was blowing a gale from 
the north, the fine sand pricking our faces like needles 
and nearly putting out our eyes. Being the advance 
post, and very near the enemy, great watchfulness 
was necessary to prevent surprise. I was up all the 
previous night and day, and yesterday at noon when 
I returned to camp, I was completely exhausted. A 
good night s rest, however, has restored me and I am 
ready for the trenches again. We have not yet 
opened a single battery on the town or castle and last 
night we got our first mortars and guns into position. 
But a small portion of our battering train has reached 
here and much anxiety is felt in regard to it, - 
whether it has been lost at sea or blown to leeward is 
not known. Forty-nine ten-inch mortars were expected of which but ten have arrived, and of the 
breaching guns only four twenty-four-pounders and 
two sixty-four-pound howitzers. With these it is 
thought we can soon reduce the city, but the castle 
may stand a longer siege. The horses of the light 
batteries and those of the Dragoons have suffered a 
great loss by the sea voyage, Duncan having lost 
fifty, and a squadron of Dragoons under Colonel 
Harney one hundred and fifteen, and those horses 
which have been landed are scarcely fit for service. . . . 
Our army is in no danger from severe fevers until 
May, and before then I hope our work will be done, 
and we shall either return or go to the mountains. . . . 
At two in the afternoon today, the city and castle 
were summoned to surrender, which, of course, was 
declined in the usual courteous terms by General 
Morales, Governor of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a> and San Juan, and 
commander of the Mexican forces, and at half-past 
three o clock six of our ten-inch mortars opened on 
the city with terrible effect. At the same time two 
small war steamers and five gun boats with heavy 
guns came to anchor within range of the castle to 
assist us in the attack. The enemy replied with every 
gun which they could bring to bear, returning at 
least three shots for every one of ours. It was a sublime spectacle from the sand hills in front of our camp 
where I was standing with Bel ton. The cannonade 
was terrific and the city and trenches were soon completely hidden by the smoke. We know that our 
shells must be doing vast injury as every one exploded in or immediately over the devoted city, and 
at the same time we felt confident that but little 
damage could be done to our troops in the trenches 
where they are covered from direct fire and are on 
the circumference of a circle, while our fire is concentrated from that circumference on a centre. We were, 
however, anxious to hear from the advance where 
were four companies of the Fifth under Major Scott. 
Chapman s company and mine were resting after 
having been forty-eight hours on duty.

At nine our regiment came in, when we learned 
that, as we supposed, we had silenced many of the 
Mexican guns, and as could be seen from the advanced 
positions had done great execution, knocking the 
spires, domes, and houses to ruins. If our weak battery of six mortars has done so much, what must have 
been the result if all our guns say fifty mortars and 
twenty or thirty heavy siege cannon, which should 
have been here had all been in operation. I do not 
believe the enemy could have held out four hours. 
</p><p>
The loss on our side was but one soldier killed, but 
the entire army are mourning the death of Captain 
John R. Vinton, one of the most intellectual and gallant 
spirits of the army. He commanded the batteries in 
the trenches and a shell passing through the parapet 
of the parallel struck him in the head killing him 
instantly. Is it not strange that of the six or seven, 
which is all who have fallen in the siege, two should 
have been officers, Vinton and Alburtis ? 
</p><p>
On the morning of the twenty- third, I was ordered 
to the trenches with a working party of one hundred 
men. A violent norther had arisen during the night, 
which blew the sand back almost as fast as we threw 
it out. The enemy were firing but little, occasionally 
a small shell would drop near us, but we could always 
see it in time to get out of its way. Our batteries, too, 
were obliged to slacken their fire as the surf during the 
gale prevented any landing from the ships, and the 
shells brought on shore were nearly expended. No 
one on our side has been wounded since the fall of 
Vinton. I came back to camp last night, filthy and 
tired enough. A good night s sleep has restored me 
and I am besides cheered to hear that eighteen more 
mortars have arrived. The more we get, the sooner 
our work will be finished and the less injury we shall 
receive.

I have just seen Uncle Edmund who says the 
" Princeton," war steamer, is about to sail for New 
York with Commodore Connor, who has been relieved by Commodore Perry. I hasten to close this 
for her mail and think it quite possible you may receive this before the last which went in a sail vessel 
on the seventeenth. I haven t seen my brother for 
several days, but hear that he is well. I am most 
thankful that Webster s name is not, so far as we can 
learn, on the list of the wounded at Buena Vista. 
Wherever there is shade and soil here, there are many 
beautiful wild flowers in blossom. I shall send one in 
this letter. ,
