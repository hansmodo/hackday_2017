Camp Rappahannock, November 5, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1863">1863</a>.

I received last night, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse sweetheart met">Mary</a>, your letter of the 2d....  I am
glad to hear that Charlotte is better.  I hope that she will get strong
and well, poor child.  The visit of her 'grandpa' will cheer her up.
I trust, and I know, he gave her plenty of good advice.  Tell Mrs.
Atkinson that her son Nelson is a very good scout and a good soldier.
I wish I had some way of promoting him.  I received the bucket of butter
she was so kind as to send me, but have had no opportunity of returning
the vessel, which I hope to be able to do.  I am sorry Smith does not
like your house.  I have told you my only objection to it, and wish
it were large enough to hold Charlotte.  It must have reminded you of
old times to have your brother Carter and Uncle Williams [Mr. Charles
Carter Lee, the General's brother; Mr. Williams Carter, the General's
uncle] to see you.  I think my rheumatism is better to-day.  I have
been through a great deal with comparatively little suffering.  I have
been wanting to review the cavalry for some time, and appointed to-day
with fear and trembling.  I had not been on horseback for five days
previously and feared I should not get through.  The governor was
here and told me Mrs. Letcher had seen you recently.  I saw all my
nephews looking very handsome, and Rob too.  The latter says he has
written to you three times since he crossed the river.  Tell Chas.
I think F's old regiment, the 9th, made the best appearance in review.

While on the ground, a man rode up to me and said he was just from
Alexandria and had been requested to give me a box, which he handed
me, but did not know who sent it.  It contained a handsome pair of gilt
spurs.  Good-night.  May a kind heavenly Father guard you all.

                      Truly and affectionately,
