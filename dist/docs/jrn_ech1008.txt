On Friday morning last we again hoisted anchor and by noon were inside of the bay in view of a greater part of the shipping opposite <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, but wind and tide being against us, we had to anchor again. Here we lay until next afternoon and in the meantime we were visited by the Custom House officers and the port physician.

On Saturday I went ashore. The town appeared to be nothing but a mud hole at this time. I proceeded immediately to the post office, very anxious to hear something of the objects nearest my heart, and I was gratified to the fullest extent. Letter after letter and paper after paper were handed out until the postage amounted to six dollars out of my scanty purse of twenty-seven, but had they cost the whole twenty-seven, I should have willingly paid it, so anxious was I to hear from friends and home. I came on board again in the evening where I have remained, employing my time in reading over my letters and papers, eagerly devouring their contents.

We expect to be landed tomorrow, and this is our last day on the Europe after a voyage of about twenty thousand miles and 222 days since we left Philadelpia. Although we have fared miserably aboard the Europe we have been at home on her so long that we feel a strong attachment as the time approaches for us to bid her farewell. Often when tossed, rolled, and turned almost upside down, we have cursed her, and the day that placed us upon her. But now when the prospect is that we are to live in tents on shore, we may yet feel the loss of her, especially if the nights are as cold generally as this is after so beautiful a day.

I shall soon be on terra firma and hence must quit my sea journal.
