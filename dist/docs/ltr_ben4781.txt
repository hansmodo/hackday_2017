DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I suppose Gov r Pownall acquaints you with what has 
passed this Session relating to our American Affairs: All 
Europe is attentive to the Dispute between Britain and the 
Colonies, & I own I have a Satisfaction in seeing, that our 
Part is taken Everywhere; because I am persuaded, that 
that circumstance will not be without its Effect here in our 
favour. At the same time the malignant Pleasure, which 
other Powers take in British Divisions, may convince us on 
both sides of the Necessity of our uniting. 
</p><p>
In France they have translated and printed the principal 
Pieces, that have been written on the American Side of the 
Question; and, as French is the political Language of 
Europe, it has communicated an Acquaintance with our 
Affairs very extensively. M. Beaumont, a famous Advocate 
</p><p>
of Paris, the defender of the Family of Galas, wrote the Reflexions d'un Etranger desinteress6, which I send you. The 
manuscript is an original Letter from a Gentleman, (of 
Note, I am told,) as far off as the Austrian Silesia, who, 
being concern'd for us, wrote it to the Parliament, directing 
it to the late Speaker. The Speaker read only the first 
Side, was offended at the Freedom, and Impertinence, (as 
he calPd it,) and returned the Letter to the Office, refusing 
to pay the Postage. Accept it as a Curiosity. I send you 
also a late Edition of Molyneux's Case of Ireland, with a new 
Preface, shrewdly written. Our part is warmly taken by 
the Irish in general, there being in many points a similarity 
in our cases. My respects to <a href='/results.php?tla=jab' rel='met'>Mr. Bowdoin</a>, and believe me 
ever, dear Sir, yours affectionately, B. FRANKLIN.
