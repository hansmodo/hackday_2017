My dear Marquis, 
</p><p>
Though the situation of southern affairs would not permit me to recall your corps to this army, yet it was with great reluctance I could resolve upon seeing you separated from head-quarters. My friendship for you 
makes me desirous of having you near me, and there will occur frequent occasions in cooperative measures, in which it would be of the greatest utility I should have it in my power to consult you. These motives 
would have induced me to propose to you to return personally to head-quarters, had I not believed you would not choose to quit your corps, and had I not foreseen a difficulty in giving you a command in the 
remaining troops. A select corps you could not have, and there are so many major-generals, who conceive themselves in a manner wedded to the different lines, and who are to be provided for, that it would not be 
easy at present to accommodate matters to your having a command in the line. But this difficulty might be overcome, and I cannot forbear, late as it is, leaving it at your option to proceed with your corps or 
return personally to head-quarters. If the last should be your choice, you will give orders to the officer you leave in command to march with all the necessary precaution, and take the orders of <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker met'>Baron Steuben</a>. 
You will at the same time write to the Baron, communicating to him your instructions, and to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a> informing him of your return. 
</p><p>
If you resolve to proceed forward, I shall have one 
consolation, which is, that from the present aspect of 
things it is perhaps most probable the weight of the 
war this campaign will be in the southern States, and 
it will become my duty to go there in person, where 
I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again. Of 
this I would not have you say any thing. 
</p><p>
April 22nd. â€” The reasons assigned in some of your letters, and others which have occurred to me, chiefly of a political nature, assure me that great advantages 
will be derived from your being wherever the French army and the American head-quarters are. I therefore not only repeat the offer contained in the enclosed 
letter, but accompany it with a wish, that you may return, if you can consistently with your own inclination relinquish your present command for the prospects I have mentioned; not else, as it always has 
been and ever will be my wish to make things as agreeable to you as the nature of the service will admit. I cannot recall the detachment for reasons, which 
in my judgment are conclusive. The accidents to which letters are liable forbid me, miless I could write 
to you in cipher, to go into a fuU explanation of some matters, of which you seem not to be well informed, and in which I wish to set you right ; but I dare not 
attempt it in a common letter, nor will there be any necessity for it if you return. 
</p><p>
I am very sorry, that any letter of mine should be the subject of public discussion, or give the smallest uneasiness to any person living. The letter, to which 
I presume you allude, was a confidential one from me to Mr. Lund Washington, with whom I have lived in perfect intimacy for nearly twenty years. I can neither 
avow the letter, as it is published by Rivington, nor 
declare that it is spurious, because my letter to this 
gentleman was written in great haste, and no copy of 
it was taken. All I remember of the matter is, that, 
at the time of writing it, I was a good deal chagrined 
to find by your letter of the 15th of March, from 
Yorktown in Virginia, that the French fleet had not at 
that time appeared within the Capes of the Chesapeake ; and I meant ui strict confidence to express my 
apprehensions and concern for the delay. But as we 
know that the alteration of a single word does oftentimes pervert the sense, or give a force to the expression, unintended by the letter-writer, I should not be 
surprised if Rivington, or the inspectors of his gazette, 
have taken that liberty with the letter in question ; 
especially as he or they have, I am told, published a 
letter from me to Governor Hancock and his answer, 
which never had an existence but in the gazette. 
That the enemy fabricated a number of letters for me 
formerly is a fact well known ; that they are not less 
capable of doing it now, few will deny. As to his asserting, that this is a genuine copy of the original, he 
well knows that their friends do not want to convict 
him of a falsehood, and that ours have not the opportunity of doing it, though both sides know his talents for lying. 
</p><p>
The event, which you seem to speak of with regret, my friendship for you would most assuredly have 
induced me to impart to you in the moment it happened, had it not been for the request of H , who desired that no mention should be made of it. 
Why this injunction on me, while he was communicating it himself, is a little extraordinary. But I complied, and religiously fulfilled it. With every sentiment 
of affectionate regard, I am, &c.
