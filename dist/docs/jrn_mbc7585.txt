<a rel='month origin' value='8'>August</a> <a rel='day origin' value='8'>8th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. To-day I saw a sword captured at Manassas. The man who brought the sword, in the early part 
of the fray, was taken prisoner by the Yankees. They stripped him, possessed themselves of his sleeve-buttons, 
and were in the act of depriving him of his boots when the rout began and the play was reversed; proceedings then 
took the opposite tack.

From a small rill in the mountain has flowed the mighty stream which has made at last Louis Wigfall the worst 
enemy the President has in the Congress, a fact which complicates our affairs no little. <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis's</a> hands ought to 
be strengthened ; he ought to be upheld. A divided house must fall, we all say.

Mrs. Sam Jones, who is called Becky by her friends and 
cronies, male and female, said that Mrs. Pickens had confided to the aforesaid Jones (nee Taylor, and so of the 
President Taylor family and cousin of <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis's</a> first 
wife), that Mrs. Wigfall " described <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> to Mrs. Pickens as a coarse Western woman. Now the fair Lucy 
Holcombe and Mrs. Wigfall had a quarrel of their own out 
in Texas, and, though reconciled, there was bitterness underneath. At first, Mrs. Joe Johnston called <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> 
"a Western belle" but when the quarrel between <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>General Johnston</a> and the President broke out, Mrs. Johnston 
took back the belle and substituted "woman" in the narrative derived from Mrs. Jones.

Commodore Barron came with glad tidings. We had taken three prizes at sea, and brought them in safely, one 
laden with molasses. General Toombs told us the President complimented Mr. Chesnut when he described the battle 
scene to his Cabinet, etc. General Toombs is certain Colonel Chesnut will be made one of the new batch of brigadiers. 
Next came Mr. Clayton, who calmly informed us Jeff Davis would not get the vote of this Congress for President, so 
we might count him out.

Mr. Meynardie first told us how pious a Christian soldier was Kershaw, how he prayed, got up, dusted his knees 
and led his men on to victory with a dash and courage equal to any Old Testament mighty man of war.

Governor Manning's account of Prince Jerome Napoleon: " He is stout and he is not handsome. Neither 
is he young, and as he reviewed our troops he was terribly overheated. He heard him say " en avant," of 
that he could testify of his own knowledge, and he was told he had been heard to say with unction " Allons " 
more than once. The sight of the battle-field had made the Prince seasick, and he received gratefully a draft of 
fiery whisky.

Arrago seemed deeply interested in Confederate statistics, and praised our doughty deeds to the skies. It was 
but soldier fare our guests received, though we did our best. It was hard sleeping and worse eating in camp. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> is half Frenchman and speaks French like a native. So one awkward mess was done away with, and it 
was a comfort to see <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> speak without the agony of finding words in the foreign language and forming them, 
with damp brow, into sentences. A different fate befell others who spoke " a little French."

General and Mrs. Cooper came to see us. She is Mrs. Smith Lee's sister. They were talking of old George Ma 
son in Virginia a name to conjure with. George Mason violently opposed the extension of slavery. He was a thorough aristocrat, and gave as his reason for refusing the blessing of slaves to the new States, Southwest and North 
west, that vulgar new people were unworthy of so sacred a right as that of holding slaves. It was not an institution 
intended for such people as they were. <a href='/results.php?tla=mnc' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Lee</a> said : " After all, what good does it do my sons that they are 
Light Horse Harry Lee's grandsons and George Mason's? I do not see that it helps them at all."

A friend in Washington writes me that we might havewalked into Washington any day for a week after Manassas, 
such were the consternation and confusion there. But the god Pan was still blowing his horn in the woods. Now she 
says Northern troops are literally pouring in from all quarters. The horses cover acres of ground. And she thinks 
we have lost our chance forever.

A man named Grey (the same gentleman whom <a href='/results.php?tla=lew' rel=''>Secretary of War Walker</a> so astonished by greeting him with, 
" Well, sir, and what is your business? ") described the battle of the 21st as one succession of blunders, redeemed by 
the indomitable courage of the two-thirds who did not run away on our side. Doctor Mason said a fugitive on the 
other side informed him that " a million of men with the devil at their back could not have whipped the rebels at Bull Run." That's nice.

There must be opposition in a free country. But it is very uncomfortable. " United we stand, divided we fall." 
<a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> showed us in The New York Tribune an extract from an Augusta (Georgia) paper saying, " Cobb is our 
man. Davis is at heart a reconstructionist. " We may be flies on the wheel, we know our insignificance ; but Mrs. Preston and myself have entered into an agreement; our 
oath is recorded on high. We mean to stand by our President and to stop all fault-finding with the powers that be, 
if we can and where we can, be the fault-finders generals or Cabinet Ministers.
