Sunday I went down to the city and received pay for three-fourths of a day's work done on Thursday last, $3.75. I attended an auction and saw champagne and other liquors selling for a little more than one-half what they can be bought for at home. Every kind of business, except mining, appears brisker on Sunday than any other time and the gambling and drinking houses are better patronized than on any other day. Indeed, Sunday here is a great day. We have Sabbath School and preaching in the fore and afternoon, and performances on the stage in the evening. I read my Bible, made a purse, and did
some cooking, preparatory to marching over the mountains to Agua Frio, some five miles distant, in order to look around and prospect a little.
<p></p>
Soon after breakfast Monday morning, I started in company with Mr. Cox and several others, for Agua Frio, a small stream which empties into the Mariposa, its bed much rougher than the latter. Between here and there are some of the largest hills that I ever climbed, from the tops of which a wide and extensive view is had. To the east the great Sierra Nevada Mountains can be seen piling their snowy peaks over each other until they are lost in the distance, and in all other directions nothing but high hills are presented, perfectly barren or covered with a few scrubby oaks and pines, or a thick coating of low bushes or chaparral. A great number of Indians, Californians, and Mexicans, and but few Americans, are at work there, doing tolerably wellmuch better, I believe, than here. We made but little. However, it must be known that we only went out prospecting and washed but little dirt. At night I returned home tired and weary.
<p></p>
The next morning I went down the creek with the intention of going to work with Mr. Smith, but found that he was still not ready. I therefore dug a hole on my lot but was prevented from getting to the slate by the water coming in upon me.
<p></p>
I commenced work with Mr. Smith and a young man named Warren Phinney of Boston, for one-fourth of what we can dig out, Mr. Smith owning the lot and having done a great deal of work upon it. I worked faithfully at the pump today, keeping the water out until noon. Three of us washed out about five dollars, but hope to do better tomorrow. Yesterday we washed only an hour and took out about two dollars.
<p></p>
A young man camped above us died. It is said his death was produced by taking medicine.
<p></p>
Strange as it may appear, it is nevertheless true that a marriage took place here, between a buxom lass from Missouri and a young man perhaps from the same place. This is the first occurrence of the kind that has taken place here, and most likely to be the last for some time, as I believe it would bother a man very much to find more than one or two single ladies in the encampment.
<p></p>
While going up to camp to get my dinner I saw the express wagon pass down towards the city. I expected letters by it and immediately after dinner I put all the money I had, seven dollars, in my pocket and went down to the express office and enquired for letters. Four were handed me at two dollars each, making eight dollars. I paid the seven I had and asked them to trust me for the other until evening, knowing that I had five dollars due me for a day's work last week; this I collected and paid in the evening as I had promised.
