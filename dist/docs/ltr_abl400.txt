<p><i>A Letter to Thurlow Weed. Executive Mansion, Washington. March 15,<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1865">1865</a></i></p>


<p>Dear Mr. Weed, Every one likes a compliment. Thank you for yours on my
little notification speech and on the recent inaugural address. I expect
the latter to wear as well as&mdash;perhaps better than&mdash;anything I have
produced; but I believe it is not immediately popular. Men are not
flattered by being shown that there has been a difference of purpose
between the Almighty and them. To deny it, however, in this case, is to
deny that there is a God governing the world. It is a truth which I
thought needed to be told, and, as whatever of humiliation there is in
it falls most directly on myself, I thought others might afford for me
to tell it.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">Truly yours, <a href="/results.php?tla=abl" rel="me">A. LINCOLN.</a></p>
