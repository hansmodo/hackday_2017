HON'D SlR, The newspapers will give you in general the intelligence we have from Europe. As far as we are enabled to 
judge of the views of the British Cabinet, the misfortunes of 
one more campaign, at least, will be necessary to conquer their 
obstinacy. They are attempting a separate peace with the 
Dutch, and talk of suspending their offensive war against us, 
and directing their whole resources against the naval power of 
France and Spain. If this be their real plan, we may be sure 
they do mean by it not to abandon their pretensions to the 
United States, but try another mode for recovering them. During their offensive exertions against our Ally, they can be practising insidious ones against us; and if in the first they should 
</p><p>

be successful, and in the latter disappointed, a renewal of a 
vigorous war upon us will certainly take place. The best 
security against every artifice and every event will be such 
military preparations on our part as will be sufficient either to 
resist or expel them, as the case may require.
