My Lord, 
</p><p>
Mr. Ansley this morning delivered the letter you did me 
the honour to write on the 26th of February last. Every 
opportunity of manifesting my attention to your lordship's 
recommendations will give me pleasure, and that induce'ment will conspire, with others of a public nature, to ensure 
to Mr. Ansley my friendly endeavours to facilitate the execution of his commission, and render his residence here 
agreeable to him. 
</p><p>
I perfectly agree in sentiment with your lordship, that it 
much concerns the honour and future intercourse of both 
countries to have the treaty of peace duly and faithfully 
executed. It 'is to be lamented that wars like the last 
usually leave behind them a degree of heat which requires 
some time and prudence to allay. Minds like yours will 
not be susceptible of it, but the mass of the people commonly 
act and reason as they feel, and have seldom sufficient temper and liberality to perceive that peace should draw a veil 
over the injuries of war, and that when hostilities cease, no 
other contest should remain, but that of who shall take the 
lead in magnanimity and manly policy. Although these 
remarks apply to both countries, yet, whatever may be said 
or written to the contrary, there is certainly, my lord, 
more temper in this country than it has credit for ; and J 
am persuaded it would become more manifest, if less 
discouraged by irritating proceedings here and abroad. In 
the Legislature of this State there are this day members 
sitting, who, it is well known, are disqualified by law for 
their conduct during the late contest ; and an act has lately 
passed for restoring all such of the gentlemen of the law 
as, for the same reason, had been suspended from the exercise of their profession. The execution of all laws of this 
sort becomes more and more relaxed, and of the many persons returned to this State from exile, and living in their 
former neighbourhoods, I have not heard of one that has 
met with any molestation. There are, indeed, certain characters who can never return with safety ; but the greater 
part of them are such as merit no other attention from 
any country than what national policy may exact. With 
respect to the generality of these people, the public mind 
daily becomes more and more composed. It is true that 
our affairs are not yet perfectly arranged; some former 
acts are to be done away, and more proper regulations to 
be introduced. There is reason, however, to hope that 
things will gradually come right, and I am persuaded that 
a little more good-nature on the part of Britain, would produce solid and mutual advantages to both countries. 
</p><p>
My lord. I write thus freely from a persuasion that your 
ideas of policy are drawn from those large and liberal views 
and principles, which apply to the future as well as the 
present, and which embrace the interests of the nation and 
of mankind, rather than the local and transitory advantages 
of partial systems and individual ambition; for your lordship's plans on the peace were certainly calculated to make 
the revolution produce only an exchange of dependence for 
friendship, and of sound and feathers for substance and permanent benefits. How greatly would it redound to the 
happiness as well as honour of all civilized people, were 
they to consider and t. ach other like fellow-citizens; 
</p><p>
each nation governing itself as it pleases, but each admitting others to a perfect freedom of commerce. The blessings resulting from the climate and local advantages of one 
countrv would then become common to all, and the bounties of nature and conveniences of art pass from nation to 
nation, without being impeded by the selfish monopolies and 
restrictions, with which narrow policy opposes the extension 
of Divine benevolence. It is pleasant, my lord, to dream 
of these things, and I often enjoy that pleasure ; but though, 
like some of our other dreams, we may wish to see them 
realized, yet the passions and prejudices of mankind forbid 
us to expect it. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, with great respect and sincere 
regard, my lord, 
</p><p>
Your lordship's most obedient 
</p><p>
And very humble servant, 
</p><p>
