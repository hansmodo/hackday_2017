My Dear Ann 
</p><p>
Your last letter was so full of interesting matter, and so graphic in describing the condition of Kentucky and its 
requirements that I could not resist sending it on a mission- where it might be useful to the country, so I enclosed it to 
Lizzie and requested her to show it to her Father, who might make good use of it- on returning it to me she says, "I 
read what you said to Father, and he read carefully Cousin Anns letter, which he will duly report to the President in 
person- I return the letter as you desired & her name will not be used"- Lizzie mentioned our Dear Ben's letter to her 
father- you are working together in this holy cause, which may God prosper! and bring back to us peace throughout 
our beloved country- the part which most interests me at present is where you dwell because the immediate aid has 
been wanting and so much might be secured by a few good officers- 1 feel as if our turn would come, from the fleets preparing in Europe, in our unprotected harbors- England with her minister at our court, is in feeling acts & words doing all 
she can to aid our rebels- and is watching an occasion to do openly what it is easy to see she desires- The Lord Mayors 
feast received Mason with honors- the illustrated News gives portraits of confederate Generals & Statesmen- & Punch is 
full of satires on the U. S. and strictures on their great men- white & black 
</p><p>
But my Dear Ann it is a happiness to hear that you are all well would I could relieve my beloved brother from some of 
his anxieties & annoyance- .... tell Dear Ben, our Purim evening was celebrated this year on the 4th- his loving 
thoughts and good wishes were more precious than all else on the occasion. I pray it may please God to permit us to meet 
again in this world and the memory of the past be sanctified to us by blessings still in store to crown his life in his own 
happy household. Adieu My dear Ann, give my love to all around you, and believe me affectionately your
