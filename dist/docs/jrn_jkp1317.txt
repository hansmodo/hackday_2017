I received a telegraphic despatch from Baltimore before breakfast this morning,
</p><p>
brought to that city by an overland express, announcing several days later news from Vera Cruz. The Baltimore Sun which arrived about eleven o'clock contained the detailed information as late as the 14th instant inclusive. It is probable that a general battle may have taken place between the two armies two or three days after that time. Santa Anna was reported to be in front of the American army with 15,000 troops to resist their passage from Vera Cruz to Jalapa. I shall await the result with much anxiety, but have no fears of it. Our forces are the best troops in the world, and would gain victories over superior forces of the enemy, if there was not an officer among them. This proves the injustice of giving all the credit of our victories to the commanding general and none to his inferior officers and men. I sent for the Secretary of War and had a consultation with him. He read to me a despatch which he had prepared to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a>. He brought with him despatches which had been received at the War Department from Brigadier-General. Kearny in California. They are duplicates of despatches transmitted by Lieut. Emory, who has not yet arrived at Washington. An unfortunate collision has occurred in California between General Kearny and Commodore Stockton, in regard to precedence in rank. I think General Kearny was right. It appears that Lieut.-Col. Frémont refused to obey General Kearny and obeyed Commodore Stockton and in this he was wrong.  8  I saw Mr. Buchanan and several other officers today on official business.

This was reception evening. A number of persons, ladies and gentlemen, called. Among them was Miss Adams, the granddaughter of Mr. John Ouincy Adams, and daughter of his son and private secretary during his Presidency, John Adams, Jr. I note the call of this young lady because it is the first that has been made by any of the family of Mr. John Quincy Adams during my Presidency except, as I understand, a card left by the female members of the family some months ago. Mr. John Quincy Adams has a house in this city, and resides here during many months of the year. He with his family are now residing in this city. I met the company in the parlour this evening and treated Miss Adams with marked respect, as it was her first visit.
