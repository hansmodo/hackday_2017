My dear Sister

The inflammation or irritation of my throat passed down so low as to make me afraid to let Dr. Green treat me & consequently I gave up the idea of going to him so long as it remains so low; it appears to be about the collar bone. But whilst I was unwilling to let the Dr. treat me I concluded that I would visit this place & try to get my liver right; as I was disposed to think that the state of the throat depended on that of the liver. After you left, my liver apparently became much deranged. I reached this place on Thursday last & I feel improved. It appears to me that smoking mullein1 has been of great benefit to me. I am fearful that I will not be able to visit you this summer & I feel it greatly.

I left Anna at the Rockbridge Baths, her health has not been so good since you left and as the Baths are celebrated for such afflictions as hers I trust that she will be improved by their use. This evening I received a letter from her stating that after bathing she had internal heat & that she was fearful that the bathing was not good for her & that if she found it not to be so that she would return home in a few days. There are about 1000 persons here at present.

I hope that I may be able to visit you, notwithstanding the present aspect of things, but don't expect me unless you hear of my coming by another letter.

I hope that your health has improved. Give my love to all. Your affectionate brother, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jjt" rel="me">Thomas</a>.
