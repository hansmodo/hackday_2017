<p>[Grant is now assisting in the adjutant-general's office, as requested by Governor Yates. In connection with the call for troops and the enthusiastic response, he says elsewhere, "There was not a State in the North of a million inhabitants that would not have furnished the entire number faster than arms would have been supplied to them, if it had been necessary."]

<center>GENERAL HEAD-QUARTERS, STATE OF ILLINOIS,<br/>
ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE</center>

<p>Springfield,<br>
May 2nd, 1861.</p>

<p>DEAR FATHER:</p>

<p>Your letter of the 24th inst was received the same evening one I had written to Mary was mailed. I would have answered earlier but for the fact I had just written.
</p>

<p>
I am not a volunteer, and indeed could not be, now that I did not go into the first Company raised in Galena. The call of the President was so promptly responded to that only those companies that organized at once, and telegraphed their application to come in, were received. All other applications were filed, and there are enough of them to furnish Illinois quota if the Army should be raised to 300,000 men. I am serving on the Governor's staff at present at his request, but suppose I shall not be here long.
</p>

<p>I should have offered myself for the Colonelcy of one of the Regiments, but I find all those places are wanted by politicians who are up to log-rolling, and I do not care to be under such persons.
</p>

<p>The war feeling is not abating here much, although hostilities appear more remote than they did a few days ago. Three of the six Regiments mustered in from this state are now at Cairo, and probably will be reinforced with two others within a few days.
</p>

<p>Galena has several more companies organized but only one of them will be able to come in under a new call for ten regiments. Chicago has raised companies enough nearly to fill all the first call. The Northern feeling is so fully aroused that they will stop at no expense of money and men to insure the success of their cause.
</p>

<p>I presume the feeling is just as strong on the other side, but they are infinitely in the minority in resources.
</p>

<p>I have not heard from Galena since coming down here, but presume all is moving along smoothly. My advice was not to urge collections from such men as we knew to be good, and to make no efforts to sell in the present distracted state of our currency. The money will not buy Eastern exchange and is liable to become worse; I think that thirty days from this we shall have specie, and the bills of good foreign banks to do business on, and then will be the time to collect.
</p>

<p>If Mary writes to me any time next week she may direct here to
</p>

<p>ULYSSES.</p>
