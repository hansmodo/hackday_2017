Dear Commodore : If you can take from here a sufficient force to oppose the Californians 
now supposed to be near the Pueblo and waiting for the approach of <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague">Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont</a>, I advise you to do so, and that you march with that force as early as possible in the 
direction of the Pueblo, by which you will either be able to form a junction with <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague">Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont</a> or make a diversion very much in his favor. 
</p><p>
I do not think that <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague">Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont</a> should be left unsupported to fight a battle upon which the fate of California may, for a long time, depend, if there are troops here to act 
in concert with him. Your force, as it advances, might surprise the enemy at the Saint Louis Mission, and make prisoners of them. 
</p><p>
I shall be happy, in such an expedition, to accompany you, and to give you any aid, either of head or hand, of which I may be capable. 
</p><p>
Yours truly, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=swk" rel="me">S. W. Kearny</a>, Brigadier-General. 
</p><p>
To Commodore Stockton, 
</p><p>
Commanding United States Forces, San Diego.
