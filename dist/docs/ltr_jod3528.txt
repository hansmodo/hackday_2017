MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
WHEN I left Paris, the 8th of March, I expected to 
have been at home before this day, and have done 
my utmost to get to sea, but the embarrassments and 
disappointments I have met with have been many, 
very many. I have, however, in the course of them, 
had a fine opportunity of seeing Nantes, L Orient 
and Brest, as well as the intermediate country. 
</p><p>
By the gracious invitation of the King, I am now 
to take passage in his frigate, the Sensible, with his 
new Ambassador to America, the Chevalier de la Luzerne. I hope to see you in six or seven weeks. 
Never was any man in such a state of uncertainty 
and suspense as I have been from last October, entirely uninformed of the intentions of Congress concerning me. This would not have been very painful 
to me if I could have got home. Your conversation 
is a compensation to me for all other things.

My son has had a great opportunity to see this 
country ; but this has unavoidably retarded his education in some other things. He has enjoyed perfect 
health, from first to last, and is respected wherever 
he goes, for his vigor and vivacity both of mind and 
body, for his constant good humor, and for his rapid 
progress in French as well as his general knowledge, 
which, for his age, is uncommon. I long to see his 
sister and brothers. I need not add
