SIR: 
</p><p>
Yours from Watbo of the 18th inst., I received, and in answer I 
assure you, that I have constantly been, since my arrival at home, and 
still am, using my utmost endeavors to send you the full one-third of 
my regiment. The twenty men with which I had your permission to 
guard the jail, have been constantly on hard duty, catching and bringing in the disobedient; so that, inclusive of what have been lately 
ordered, and the guard will bring you, in addition to Major Thomas's 
class, at least fifty men; and hope to have it in my power, about the 3d 
of next month, to send you some more, as I expect by that time to have 
another squad gathered. But, without this armed party to be constantly on duty, and monthly relieved, I cannot do anything, for the 
district is so extensive, the duty so hard, and the distance to your camp 
so far, that it can't be expected that the men who have just been discharged from your camp can perform that duty. This mode would 
have been better executed if the Commanding Officer of my regiment 
at home, when I was in the camp, had not have hindered every part of 
my orders (that was in his power) for that purpose. There are but 
fourteen of the twenty men mentioned that are at this time fit for duty, 
six of whom I send with the party, and the others will come with the 
next I have mentioned; though, 1 hope, you will send them back, as 
the law cannot be enforced without them. The people are, at this time, 
very sickly about home, as has appeared by the trials of a number of 
men by a regimental court 1 lately ordered, and held four days, when 
I used every lawful and reasonable method in my power to turn out the 
men. There are several men. whom the guard will bring down, sentenced to some extraordinary duty, a list of whose names, and their 
term of service, I will send to Major Thomas. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, with all due respect, your obdt. humble servant, 
</p><p>

N. B. If you permit me to continue the guard at the jail&gt; please 
f,o ffive some instruction? about salt, &c.. for them, as it is scarce here.
