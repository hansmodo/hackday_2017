I have the honor to inform your Excellency, that 
this morning <a href='/results.php?tla=jhs' rel='colleague met'>General Stark</a> arrived here to take the 
command of this department, and I have communicated to him such of your Excellency's instructions as 
may tend to the good of the service, and security of 
the frontier. He reports that the militia from the 
eastward are in a state of preparation, and he expects 
a detachment of them in town by the last of this 
week. The levies from this State are coming in fast. 
</p><p>
More than one hundred have already arrived, so that 
it is probable that, by the time I am favored with 
your further orders, matters will be in such train that 
I can move down without any impediment. 
</p><p>
On Tuesday night, about ten o'clock, a most daring 
attempt was made by a party of the enemy, headed 
by a Captain Myers, to surprise <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a> in 
his house, at this place. With difficulty the General escaped into one of the upper chambers, and, by firing a few shot out of the window, alarmed the city. 
They were prevented from following him by the servants, who made every opposition in their power, 
against a decided superiority. Two of them (the 
servants) were taken off, with soldiers in 
and one wounded with a bayonet, also a quantity 
of plate, &c. Notwithstanding every exertion of the 
inhabitants, and of the troops in town, to intercept 
them, they made their escape, though I hope some 
of them may yet be taken, as the country through 
which they must pass is alarmed. 
</p><p>
By a prisoner, we learn that a detachment, consisting of near thirty, left Canada the 16th ultimo, and 
divided into six small parties on the frontier, with a 
design to take off some respectable characters. One 
party was taken by a <a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a> scout, with a certain Captain John Bleecker, and his negro, whom 
they were bringing off. 
</p><p>
Since the above was written, I have been favored 
with yours of the 5th instant, and shall wait here your 
Excellency's further orders. I have the honor to be, 
Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most humble servant, 
</p><p>
