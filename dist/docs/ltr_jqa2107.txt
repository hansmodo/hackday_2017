THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, June 6, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1796">1796</a>. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
At length I have been released from a situation equally 
remote from all public utility and all personal satisfaction. 
After a detention which I could not avoid, but which was at 
least unnecessary, of several months, I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> on the 
28th of last month, and arrived here on the 31st. The 
people there were in the midst of the Saturnalian electioneering holidays. The writs issued for the new Parliament 
are made returnable on the I2th of July. The changes will 
not be numerous, and the majorities of the Minister will be 
as great as they have been hitherto. Such at least was the 
general opinion, which was confirmed by the elections that 
had been made previous to my departure. 
</p><p>
The account of the resolution of the House of Representatives of the United States relative to the British treaty, 
passed on the 17th of April, had arrived a few days before 
I came away. It was brought by the Arab, a sloop of war 
dispatched from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> expressly for the purpose, and 
which had a passage of only twenty-three days. The resolution was considered as the natural precursor of a final decision not to pass the laws necessary to carry the treaty into 
effect on the part of the United States, and the sensation 
which the intelligence produced was even greater than I 
should have expected. I confess it made me doubly desirous to quit a country, where the malevolence that is so common against America was exulting in the triumph with 
which it pointed to the event, as a proof of our executive 
imbecility, or of our legislative perfidy. It was difficult to 
refute both the alternatives, and I retired with pleasure 
from the humiliating task of palliating what I felt myself 
altogether incapable to justify. 
</p><p>
To all the Americans in England that I met with after the 
news of this resolution, it was quite unexpected, as their 
accounts from home had uniformly led them to the hope or 
fear of a different event. But I cannot say the case was 
thus with me, and in my letter of April 4, which I hope has 
reached you before this, you will find at full length the 
opinion that I then held upon the subject. As a party manoeuvre the proceedings to which the House have given their 
sanction was well conducted, and indeed it would be blindness not to perceive that the operations of that party are 
conducted with a skill, and perseverance, and harmony, and 
consistency, which the friends of the government seldom 
discover. That all the weight of French influence was exerted on that occasion is unquestionable. The delivery of 
the forts was a thing too much dreaded by them, to be suffered without a struggle. That event would have been the 
death blow to all their hopes of engaging the United States 
in the war, and they well knew it was inevitable, if the treaty 
did not first meet with non-compliance on our part. Under 
the present circumstances the forts will assuredly not be 
delivered, and the party who have succeeded in preventing 
it, will make them again the watchword of their war-whoop. 
You may depend upon it as a certain fact, that the French 
policy of the present day is determined upon involving us 
yet in the war. From the complexion of the present House 
of Representatives I have strong apprehensions that they 
will succeed ; if they do, we shall not be found despicable 
enemies. But what will become of our national government? 
What will become of our federal union? I am unwilling 
to look the prospect in the face. 
</p><p>
If the late proceedings of the House were to be considered 
merely as the flashes of anger and resentment against the 
British government, whatever my opinion of their wisdom 
might be, I should concur with my whole soul in the motives, 
and should have comparatively but trifling apprehensions 
of the consequences. But the wound is evidently deeper, 
the symptoms indicate an infallible struggle between the 
popular and executive branches of our government. In 
such a struggle what will become of the executive? Especially if it should get encumbered with such a distressing 
war as they are endeavoring to excite. In my opinion it 
must inevitably fall. 
</p><p>
The system of French government in America is not 
changed as far as I can discover. But an alteration of 
measures has certainly taken place. The bullying embassy 
which I mentioned in my N. 19 as being in contemplation 
is now said to be laid aside, and even Mr. Paine's threatened 
pamphlet has not yet appeared. He has only published a piece upon the English finances, which I sent you from Lon 
don, and which in his own opinion amply revenges all the 
injuries and insults which the United States and France 
have received from Great Britain for the last four years. 
What the present views of the American representation in 
France are I am unable to say, but the final object of the 
French system is still to involve us in war and to new model 
our executive. . . .
