Sir : Enclosed you have a copy of my answer to the general and prefecto of this place, one to <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a>, and the second letter from the prefect. <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a> is eight or nine leagues from this place encamped, 
intending to move as soon as the state of his horses will permit. There will be two to three hundred people collected together to-morrow, with the 
intention of attacking the camp. <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a> has about fifty men - all men of confidence, and remarkably well armed. Neither himself nor men 
have any fears respecting the result of the present state of affairs; yet, be the result for or against him, it may prove of a disadvantage to the resident 
Americans in California. I have at some (risk) despatched out two couriers to the camp, with duplicate letters, and this letter I send to Santa Barbara, in expectation of finding a vessel bound to Mazatlan. Having 
had over one-half of my hospital expenses of 1844 cut off, and know not why, and even my bill for a flag, I do not feel disposed to hazard much for government, though the life of <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a> and party may need it. I 
hardly know how to act. I have only received one letter (of June) from the department for the year 1845. In the month of February, <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a>, in my company, visited the general, prefecto, and alcalde of this 
place, and informed them of his business ; and there was no objection made. Within twenty days the general says he had received direct and specific orders from Mexico not to allow <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a> to enter California; 
which, -perhaps, accounts for the change of feelings with the people. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, with the highest respect and consideration, Your obedient servant, (Signed) <a href="/results.php?tla=tol" rel="me">Thomas O. Larkin</a>. 
</p><p>
To the Hon. Secretary of State, City of Washington.
