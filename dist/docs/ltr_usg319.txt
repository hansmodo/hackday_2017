<i>biograper's note</i><p>[September 4th, Grant had removed headquarters from Cape Girardeau to
Cairo, Ill. Hearing that the Confederates were about to seize Paducah,
Ky., he went there immediately, arriving there a few hours before the
enemy, who returned to Columbus. Before leaving Grant addressed a
short proclamation to the citizens promising them protection. Troops
were left to guard the city.

DEAR SISTER:
</p><p>
Your letter with a short one from Father was received yesterday, and
having a little time I answer it.
</p><p>
The troops under me and the rebel forces are getting so close together
however that I have to watch all points. Since taking command I have
taken possession of the Kentucky bank opposite here, fortified it and
placed four large pieces in position. Have occupied Norfolk, Missouri,
and taken possession of Paducah. My troops are so close to the enemy
as to occasionally exchange shots with the pickets. To day, or rather
last night, sixty or seventy rebels came upon seventeen of our men and
were repulsed with a loss of two men killed on their side, none hurt
on ours. Yesterday there was skirmishing all day. We had but two
wounded however, whilst the loss must have been considerable on the
other.
</p><p>
What future operations will be, of course I don't know. I could not
write about it in advance if I did. The rebel force numerically is
much stronger than ours, but the difference is more than made up by
having truth and justice on our side, whilst on the other they are
cheered on by falsehood and deception. This war however is formidable
and I regret to say cannot end so soon as I anticipated at first.
</p><p>
Father asks for a position for Albert Griffith. I have no place to
give and at best could use only my influence. I receive letters from
all over the country for such places, but do not answer them. I never
asked for my present position, but now that I have it I intend to
perform the duties as rigidly as I know how without looking out for
places for others. I should be very glad if I had a position within my
own gift for Al. but I have not.
</p><p>
My duties are very laborious and have been from the start. It is a
rare thing that I get to bed before two or three o'clock in the
morning and am usually wakened in the morning before getting awake in
a natural way. Now, however, my staff are getting a little in the way
of this kind of business and can help me.
</p><p>
I have been stopped so often already in writing this that I have
forgotten what I was going to write about.
</p><p>
Are you talking of paying Julia a visit? I wrote to you and father
about it several times but have failed to elicit an answer on that
point. I intended to have Julia, Miss and Jess come down here to pay
me a visit but I hardly think it would be prudent at this time.
Hearing artillery within a few miles it might embarrass my movements
to have them about. I am afraid they would make poor soldiers.
</p><p>
Write to me again soon.
</p><p>
Good night.
</p>
ULYS.
