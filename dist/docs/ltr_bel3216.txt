SIR, 
</p><p>
You will please to take the command of five hundred men, and 
proceed, in the best route, to cross the Narrows, as soon as may 
be, to the landing at the north end of Lake George ; and, if you 
find any of our men prisoners there, you will relieve them, and 
destroy all such boats and stores belonging to the enemy as may 
fall within your power ; and if, upon inquiry, you find that you 
can attempt <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, without risking too much, you will do 
it. As in all your movements you must be regulated by the in 
formation you receive of the situation of the enemy, which may 
be such as to render it impossible to execute these orders, you 
are, therefore, to consider them as discretionary ; and, if you find 
matters different from what hath been represented, and you can 
not prosecute the above plan, you will adopt such an one, as, in 
your opinion, will most annoy, divide, and distract the enemy. 
<a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. You will give me, from time to time, the earliest information 
possible of your movements, and of the discoveries you shall 
make. I wish you success. 
</p><p>
And am, dear Sir, &e., 
</p><p>
