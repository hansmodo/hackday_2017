C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. On April 23, 1840, I was married, aged seventeen ; consequently on the 31st of March, 1862, I was 
thirty-nine. I saw a wedding to-day from my window, which opens on Trinity Church. Nanna Shand married a 
Doctor Wilson. Then, a beautiful bevy of girls rushed into my room. Such a flutter and a chatter. Well, thank 
Heaven for a wedding. It is a charming relief from the dismal litany tff-trnr~tlaily songT"

A letter today from our octogenarian at Mulberry. His nephew, Jack Deas, had two horses shot under him ; the 
old Colonel has his growl, " That's enough for glory, and no hurt after all." He ends, however, with his never-failing refrain : We can't fight all the world ; two and two only make four; it can't make a thousand; numbers will not lie. 
He says he has lost half a million already in railroad bonds, bank stock, Western notes of hand, not to speak of negroes 
to be freed, and lands to be confiscated, for he takes the gloomiest views of all things.
