Dear Brother : I am drifting along in the old rut in 
good strength, attending to about four dinners a week at 
public or private houses, and generally wind up for 
gossip at the Union League Club. Last night, discussing the effect of Mr. Windom's death and funeral, several prominent gentlemen remarked that Windom's fine 
speech just preceding his death was in line with yours 
on the silver question in the Senate, and also with a 
carefully prepared interview with you by George Alfred 
Townsend, which I had not seen. I have ordered of my 
book-man the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> " Sun " of Sunday, February 1st, 
which contains the interview. 
</p><p>
You sent me a copy of your bill in pamphlet form, 
which was begged from me, and as others naturally apply 
for copies I wish you would have your secretary send 
me a dozen, that I may distribute them. 
All well here and send love. 
</p><p>
Your affectionate brother, 
</p><p>
