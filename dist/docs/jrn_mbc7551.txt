<a rel='month origin' value='4'>April</a> <a rel='day origin' value='12'>12th</a>  [<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city origin'>CHARLESTON</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. Anderson will not capitulate. Yesterday's was the merriest, maddest dinner we have had yet. Men 
were audaciously wise and witty. We had an unspoken foreboding that it was to be our last pleasant meeting. 
Mr. Miles dined with us to-day. Mrs. Henry King rushed in saying, " The news, I come for the latest news. All the 
men of the King family are on the Island, of which fact she seemed proud. 
</p><p>
While she was here our peace negotiator, or envoy, came in that is, Mr. Chesnut returned. His interview 
with Colonel Anderson had been deeply interesting, but Mr. Chesnut was not inclined to be communicative. He 
wanted his dinner. He felt for Anderson and had tele graphed to <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>President Davis</a> for instructions what answer 
to give Anderson, etc. He has now gone back to Fort Sumter with additional instructions. When they were about to 
leave the wharf A. H. Boykin sprang into the boat in great excitement. He thought himself ill-used, with a likelihood 
of fighting and he to be left behind ! 
</p><p>
I do not pretend to go to sleep. How can I If Anderson does not accept terms at four, the orders are, he shall be 
fired upon. I count four, St. Michael's bells chime out and I begin to hope. At half -past four the heavy booming of a 
cannon. I sprang out of bed, and on my knees prostrate I prayed as I never prayed before. 
</p><p>
There was a sound of stir all over the house, pattering of feet in the corridors. All seemed hurrying one way. 
I put on my double-gown and a shawl and went, too. It was to the housetop. The shells were bursting. In the 
dark I heard a man say, Waste of ammunition. I knew my husband was rowing about in a boat somewhere in that 
dark bay, and that the shells were roofing it over, bursting toward the fort. If Anderson was obstinate, Colonel Chesnut was to order the fort on one side to open fire. Certainly fire had begun. The regular roar of the cannon, 
there it was. And who could tell what each volley accomplished of death and destruction ? 
</p><p>
The women were wild there on the housetop. Prayers came from the women and imprecations from the men. 
And then a shell would light up the scene. To-night they say the forces are to attempt to land. We watched up 
there, and everybody wondered that Fort Sumter did not fire a shot. 
</p><p>
To-day Miles and Manning, colonels now, aides to <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a>, dined with us. The latter hoped I would keep 
the peace. I gave him only good words, for he was to be under fire all day and night, down in the bay carrying orders, etc. 
</p><p>
Last night, or this morning truly, up on the housetop I was so weak and weary I sat down on something that 
looked like a black stool. " Get up, you foolish woman. Your dress is on fire," cried a man. And he put me out. 
I was on a chimney and the sparks had caught my clothes. Susan Preston and Mr. Venable then came up. But my 
fire had been extinguished before it burst out into a regular blaze. 
</p><p>
Do you know, after all that noise and our tears and prayers, nobody has been hurt ; sound and fury signifying 
nothing a delusion and a snare.

Louisa Hamilton came here now. This is a sort of news center. Jack Hamilton, her handsome young husband, has 
all the credit of a famous battery, which is made of rail road iron. Mr. Petigru calls it the boomerang, because it 
throws the balls back the way they came ; so Lou Hamilton tells us. During her first marriage, she had no children; 
hence the value of this lately achieved baby. To divert Louisa from the glories of " the Battery," of which she 
raves, we asked if the baby could talk yet. " No, not exactly, but he imitates the big gun when he hears that. 
</p><p>
He claps his hands and cries Boom, boom. Her mind 
is distinctly occupied by three things: Lieutenant Hamilton, whom she calls " Randolph," the baby, and the big 
gun, and it refuses to hold more. 
</p><p>
Pryor, of Virginia, spoke from the piazza of the Charleston hotel. I asked what he said. An irreverent woman replied: " Oh, they all say the same thing, but he made great play with that long hair of his, which he is always 
tossing aside ! : 
</p><p>
Somebody came in just now and reported Colonel Chesnut asleep on the sofa in <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>General Beauregard's</a> room. 
After two such nights he must be so tired as to be able to sleep anywhere. 
</p><p>
Just bade farewell to Langdon Cheves. He is forced to go home and leave this interesting place. Says he feels 
like the man that was not killed at Thermopylae. I think he said that unfortunate had to hang himself when he got 
home for very shame. Maybe he fell on his sword, which was the strictly classic way of ending matters. 
</p><p>
I do not wonder at Louisa Hamilton's baby; we hear nothing, can listen to nothing; boom, boom goes the can 
non all the time. The nervous strain is awful, alone in this darkened room. " Richmond and Washington ablaze," 
say the papers blazing with excitement. Why not? To us these last days events seem frightfully great. We 
were all women on that iron balcony. Men are only seen at a distance now. Stark Means, marching under the piazza 
at the head of his regiment, held his cap in his hand all the time he was in sight. Mrs. Means was leaning over and 
looking with tearful eyes, when an unknown creature asked, " Why did he take his hat off ? " Mrs. Means stood 
straight up and said : " He did that in honor of his mother ; he saw me. She is a proud mother, and at the same time 
most unhappy. Her lovely daughter Emma is dying in there, before her eyes, of consumption. At that moment 
I am sure Mrs. Means had a spasm of the heart; at least, she looked as I feel sometimes. She took my arm and we came in.
