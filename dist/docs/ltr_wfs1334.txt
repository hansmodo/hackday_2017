HEADQUARTERS OP THE ARMY, 
<p></p>
NATIONAL PALACE OF MEXICO, 
<p></p>
MEXICO, September 18, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>.

SIR: 
 
At the end of another series of arduous and brilliant operations, of more than forty-eight hours continuance, this glorious army hoisted, on the morning of 
the 14th, the colors of the United States on the walls 
of this palace. 
<p></p>
The victory of the 8th, at the Molinos del Rey, was 
followed by daring reconnaissances on the part of 
our distinguished engineers Captain Lee, Lieutenants 
Beauregard, Stevens and Tower Major Smith, senior, 
being sick, and Captain Mason, third in rank, wound 
ed. Their operations were directed principally to the 
south toward the gates of the Piedad, San Angel, 
(Nino Perdido), <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san antonio" rel="city">San Antonio</a>, and the Paseo de la Yiga. 
<p></p>
This city stands on a slight swell of ground, near 
the centre of an irregular basin, and is girdled with a 
ditch in its greater extent a navigable canal of great 
breadth and depth very difficult to bridge in the 
presence of an enemy, and. serving at once for drain 
age, custom-house purposes, and military defence ; 
leaving eight entrances or gates, over arches each of 
which we found defended by a system of strong works, 
that seemed to require nothing but some men and 
guns to be impregnable. 
<p></p>
Outside and within the cross-fires of those gates, we 
found to the south other obstacles but little less for 
midable. All the approaches near the city are over 
elevated causeways, cut in many places (to oppose us), 
and flanked on both sides by ditches, also of unusual 
dimensions. The numerous cross-roads are flanked in 
like manner, having bridges at the intersections, recently broken. The meadows thus checkered, are, 
moreover, in many spots, under water or marshy ; for, 
it will be remembered, we were in the midst of the wet 
season, though with less rain than usual, and we could 
not wait for the fall of the neighboring lakes and the 
consequent drainage of the wet grounds at the edge of 
the city the lowest in the whole basin. 
<p></p>
After a close personal survey of the southern gates, 
covered by Pillow's division and Eiley s brigade of 
Twiggs s with four times our numbers concentrated 
in our immediate front I determined, on the llth, 
to avoid that network of obstacle, and to seek, by a 
sudden inversion to the southwest and west, less un 
favorable approaches. 
<p></p>
To economize the lives of our gallant officers and 
men, as well as to insure success, it became indispensable that this resolution should be long masked from 
the enemy ; and again, that the new movement when 
discovered, should be mistaken for a feint, and the old 
as indicating our true and ultimate point of attack. 
<p></p>
Accordingly, on the spot, the llth, I ordered Quitman's division from Coyoacan, to join Pillow ~by day 
light before the southern gates, and then that the two 
major-generals with their divisions, should ly night 
proceed (two miles) to join me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tacubaya" rel="city">TACUBAYA</a>, where I 
was quartered with Worth's division. Twiggs, with 
Riley's brigade and Captains Taylor's and Steptoe's 
field batteries the latter of 12-pounders was left in 
front of those gates to manoeuvre, to threaten, or to 
make false attacks, in order to occupy and deceive the 
enemy. Twiggs's other brigade (Smith's) was left at 
supporting distance in the rear at San Angel, till the 
morning of the 13th, and also to support our general 
depot at Mixcoac. The stratagem against the south 
was admirably executed throughout the 12th and down 
to the afternoon of the 13th, when it was too late for 
the enemy to recover from the effects of his delusion. 
<p></p>
The first step in the new movement was to carry 
Chapultepec, a natural and isolated mound of great 
elevation, strongly fortified at its base, on its acclivities and heights. Besides a numerous garrison, here 
was the military college of the republic, with a large 
number of sub-lieutenants and other students. Those 
works were within direct gunshot of the village of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tacubaya" rel="city">TACUBAYA</a>, and, until carried, we could not approach 
the city on the west without making a circuit too wide 
and too hazardous. 
<p></p>
In the course of the same night (that of the llth), 
heavy batteries within easy ranges were established. 
"No. 1, on our right, under the command of Captain 
Drum, 4th Artillery (relieved the next day for some 
hours by Lieutenant Andrews of the 3d), and No. 2, 
commanded by Lieutenant Hagner, Ordnance both 
supported by Quitman's division. !N~os. 3 and 4, on 
the opposite side, supported by Pillow's division, were 
commanded, the former by Captain Brooks and Lieutenant S. S. Anderson, 2d Artillery, alternately, and 
the latter by Lieutenant Stone, Ordnance. The batteries were traced by Captain Huger, Ordnance, and 
Captain Lee, Engineer, and constructed by them with 
the able assistance of the young officers of those corps 
and of the artillery. 
<p></p>
To prepare for an assault, it was foreseen that the 
play of the batteries might run into the second day; 
but recent captures had not only trebled our siege 
pieces, but also our ammunition ; and we knew that 
we should greatly augment both by carrying the place. 
I was, therefore, in no haste in ordering an assault be 
fore the works were well crippled by our missiles. 
<p></p>
The bombardment and cannonade, under the direction of Captain Huger, were commenced early in the 
morning of the 12th. Before nightfall, which necessarily stopped our batteries, we had perceived that a 
good impression had been made on the castle and its 
outworks, and that a large body of the enemy had remained outside, toward the city, from an early hour, 
to avoid our fire, but to be at hand on its cessation in 
order to reenforce the garrison against an assault. The 
same outside force was discovered the next morning 
after our batteries had reopened upon the castle, by 
which we again reduced its garrison to the minimum 
needed for the guns. 
<p></p>
Pillow and Quitman had been in position since 
early in the night of the llth. Major-General "Worth 
was now ordered to hold his division in reserve, near 
the foundery, to support Pillow ; and Brigadier-General 
Smith, of Twiggs's division, had just arrived with his 
brigade from Piedad (two miles), to support Quitman. 
Twiggs s guns before the southern gates, again reminded us, as the day before, that he, with Riley's 
brigade and Taylor's and Steptoe s batteries, was in 
activity threatening the southern gates, and thus hold 
ing a great part of the Mexican army on the defensive. 
<p></p>
Worth's division furnished Pillow's attack with an 
assaulting party of some two hundred and fifty volunteer officers and men, under Captain McKenzie, of the 
2d Artillery ; and Twiggs's division supplied a similar 
one, commanded by Captain Casey, 2d Infantry, to 
Quitman. Each of these little columns was furnished 
with scaling ladders. 
<p></p>
The signal I had appointed for the attack was the 
momentary cessation of fire on the part of our heavy 
batteries. About eight o clock in the morning of the 
13th, judging that the time had arrived, by the effect 
of the missiles we had thrown, I sent an aide-de-camp 
to Pillow,, and another to Quitman, with notice that 
the concerted signal was about to be given. Both 
columns now advanced with an alacrity that gave 
assurance of prompt success. The batteries, seizing 
opportunities, threw shots and shells upon the enemy- 
over the heads of our men with good effect, particularly 
at every attempt to reenforce the works from without 
to meet our assault. 
<p></p>
Major-General Pillow's approach on the west side, 
lay through an open grove filled with sharpshooters, 
who were speedily dislodged : when, being up with the 
front of the attack, and emerging into open space at 
the foot of a rocky aoclivity, that gallant leader was 
struck down by an agonizing wound. The immediate 
command devolved on Brigadier-General Cadwallader, 
in the absence of the senior brigadier (Pierce) of the 
same division an invalid since the events of August 
19. On a previous call of Pillow, "Worth had just sent 
him a reenforcement Colonel Clarke s brigade. 
<p></p>
The broken acclivity was still to be ascended, and 
a strong redoubt, midway, to be carried, before reach 
ing the castle on the heights. The advance of our 
brave men, led by brave officers; though necessarily 
slow, was unwavering, over rocks, chasms, and mines, 
and under the hottest fire of cannon and musketry. 
The redoubt now yielded to resistless valor, and the 
shouts that followed announced to the castle the fate 
that impended. The enemy were steadily driven from 
shelter to shelter. The retreat allowed not time to fire 
a single mine, without the certainty of blowing up 
friend and foe. Those who, at a distance, attempted 
to apply matches to the long trains, were shot down by 
our men. There was death below, as well as above 
ground. At length the ditch and wall of the main 
work were reached ; the scaling ladders were brought 
up and planted by the storming parties ; some of the 
daring spirits, first in the assault, were cast down 
killed or wounded ; but a lodgment was soon made ; 
streams of heroes followed ; all opposition was over 
come, and several of our regimental colors flung out 
from the upper walls, amidst long-continued shouts 
and cheers, which sent dismay into the capital. No 
scene could have been more animating or glorious. 
<p></p>
Major-General Quitman, nobly supported by Brigadier-Generals Shields and Smith (P. F.), his other 
officers and men, was up with the part assigned him. 
Simultaneously with the movement on the west, he had 
gallantly approached the southeast of the same works 
over a causeway with cuts and batteries, and defended 
by an army strongly posted outside, to the east of the 
works. Those formidable obstacles Quitman had to 
face, with but little shelter for his troops or space for 
manoeuvring. Deep ditches, flanking the causeway, 
made it difficult to cross on either side into the adjoin 
ing meadows, and these again were intersected by other 
ditches. Smith and his brigade had been early thrown 
out to make a sweep to the right, in order to present a 
front against the enemy's line (outside), and to turn two 
intervening batteries, near the foot of Chapultepec. 
<p></p>
This movement was also intended to support Quitman's storming parties, both on the causeway. The 
first of these, furnished by Twiggs's division, was com 
manded in succession by Captain Casey, 2d Infantry, 
and Captain Paul, 7th Infantry, after Casey had been 
severely wounded ; and the second, originally under 
the gallant Major Twiggs, Marine Corps, killed, and 
then Captain Miller, 2d Pennsylvania Yolunteers. The 
storming party, now commanded by Captain Paul, 
seconded by Captain Roberts of the Rifles, Lieutenant 
Stewart, and others of the same regiment, Smith's brigade, carried the two batteries in the road, took some 
guns, with many prisoners, and drove the enemy posted 
behind in support. The New York and South Carolina 
Volunteers (Shields s brigade), and the 2d Pennsylvania 
Volunteers, all on the left of Quitman's line, together 
with portions of his storming parties, crossed the mead 
ows in front under a heavy fire, and entered the outer 
enclosure of Chapultepec just in time to join in the final 
assault from the west. 
<p></p>
Besides Major-Generals Pillow and Quitman, Brigadier-Generals Shields, Smith, and Cadwallader, the 
following are the officers and corps most distinguished 
in those brilliant operations : The Yoltigeur regiment, 
in two detachments, commanded respectively by Colonel Andrews and Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Johnston 
the latter mostly in the lead, accompanied by Major 
Caldwell ; Captains Barnard and C. J. Biddle, of the 
same regiment the former the first to plant a regimen 
tal color, and the latter among the first in the assault ; 
the storming party of Worth's division, under Captain McKenzie, 2d Artillery, with Lieutenant Selden, 
8th Infantry, early on the ladder and badly wounded ; 
Lieutenant Armistead, 6th Infantry, the first to leap 
into the ditch to plant a ladder ; Lieutenant Rogers, 
of the 4th, and J. P. Smith, of the 5th Infantry both 
mortally wounded; the 9th Infantry, under Colonel 
Ransom, who was killed while gallantly leading that 
gallant regiment ; the 15th Infantry, under Lieutenant- 
Colonel Howard and Major Woods, with Captain Chase, 
whose company gallantly carried the redoubt, midway 
up the acclivity; Colonel Clarke s brigade (Worth's 
division), consisting of the 5th, 8th, and part of the 
6th regiments of infantry, commanded respectively by 
Captain Chapman, Major Montgomery, and Lieutenant 
Edward Johnson the latter specially noticed with 
Lieutenants Longstreet (badly wounded, advancing, 
colors in hand), Pickett, and Merchant the last three 
of the 8th Infantry; portions of the United States 
Marines, New York, South Carolina, and 2d Pennsyl 
vania Volunteers, which, delayed with their division 
(Quitman s) by the hot engagement below, arrived just 
in time to participate in the assault of the heights ; 
particularly a detachment, under Lieutenant Reed, 
[New York Volunteers, consisting of a company of the 
same, with one of marines ; and another detachment, 
a portion of the storming party (Twiggs s division, 
serving with Quitman), under Lieutenant Steele, 2d 
Infantry, after the fall of Lieutenant Gantt, 7th In 
fantry. 
<p></p>
In this connection, it is but just to recall the deci 
sive effect of the heavy batteries, Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4, 
commanded by those excellent officers, Captain Drum, 
4th Artillery, assisted by Lieutenants Benjamin and 
Porter of his own company ; Captain Brooks and Lieutenant Anderson, 2d Artillery, assisted by Lieutenant 
Russell, 4th Infantry, a volunteer ; Lieutenants Hagner 
and Stone, of the Ordnance, and Lieutenant Andrews, 
3d Artillery the whole superintended by Captain 
Huger, Chief of Ordnance with this army, an officer 
distinguished by every kind of merit. The Mountain 
Howitzer Battery, under Lieutenant Reno, of the Ord 
nance, deserves also to be particularly mentioned. 
Attached to the Yoltigeurs, it followed the movements 
of that regiment, and again won applause. 
<p></p>
In adding to the list of individuals of conspicuous 
merit, I must limit myself to a few of the many names 
which might be enumerated : Captain Hooker, Assist 
ant Adjutant-General, who won special applause, successively, in the staff of Pillow and Cadwallader ; Lieu 
tenant Lovell, 4th Artillery (wounded), chief of Quitman's staff; Captain Page, Assistant Adjutant-General 
(wounded), and Lieutenant Hammond, 3d Artillery, 
both of Shields's staff, and Lieutenant Yan Dora (7th 
Infantry), Aide-de-Camp to Brigadier-General Smith. 
<p></p>
Those operations all occurred on the west, southeast, and heights of Chapultepec. To the north, and 
at the base of the mound, inaccessible on that side, the 
llth Infantry, under Lieutenant-Colonel Hebert, the 
14th, under Colonel Trousdale, and Captain Magruder s 
field battery, 1st Artillery, one section advanced under 
Lieutenant Jackson, all of Pillow's division, had, at 
the same time, some spirited affairs against superior 
numbers, driving the enemy from a battery in the road, 
and capturing a gun. In these, the officers and corps 
named gained merited praise. Colonel Trousdale, the 
commander, though twice wounded, continued on duty 
until the heights were carried. 
<p></p>
Early in the morning of the 13th, I repeated the 
orders of the night before to Major-General Worth, to 
be with his division at hand to support the movement 
of Major-General Pillow from our left. The latter 
seems soon to have called for that entire division, 
standing momentarily in reserve, and "Worth'sent him 
Colonel Clarke s brigade. The call, if not unnecessary, 
was at least, from the circumstances, unknown to me 
at the time; for, soon observing tl^jat the very large 
body of the enemy, in the road in front of Major-General Quitman's right, was receiving reinforcements 
from the city less than a mile and a half to the east 
I sent instructions to Worth, on our opposite flank, to 
turn Chapultepec with his division, and to proceed 
cautiously by the road at its northern base, in order, 
if not met by very superior numbers, to threaten or to 
attack in rear that body of the enemy. The movement 
it was also believed could not fail to distract and to in 
timidate the enemy generally. 
<p></p>
Worth promptly advanced with his remaining brigade Colonel Garland s Lieutenant - Colonel C. F. 
Smith's light battalion, Lieutenant - Colonel Duncan's 
field battery all of his division and three squadrons 
of dragoons, under Major Sumner, which I had just 
ordered up to join in the movement. 
<p></p>
Having turned the forest on the west, and arriving 
opposite to the north centre of Chapultepec, "Worth 
came up with the troops in the road, under Colonel 
Trousdale, and aided, by a flank movement of a part 
of Garland s brigade, in taking the one-gun breastwork, 
then under the fire of Lieutenant Jackson s section of 
Captain Magruder s field battery. Continuing to ad 
vance, this division passed Chapultepec, attacking the 
right of the enemy's line, resting on that road, about 
the moment of the general retreat consequent upon the 
capture of the formidable castle and its outworks. 
<p></p>
Arriving some minutes later, and mounting to the 
top of the castle, the whole field to the east lay plainly 
under my view. 
<p></p>
There are two routes from Chapultepec to the capital the one on the right entering the same gate, 
Belen, with the road from the south, via Piedad ; and 
the other obliquing to the left, to intersect the great 
western, or San Cosme road, in a suburb outside of the 
gate of San Cosme. 
<p></p>
Each of these routes (an elevated causeway) presents 
a double roadway on the sides of an aqueduct of strong 
masonry, and great height, resting on open arches and 
massive pillars, which, together, afford fine points both 
for attack and defence. The sideways of both aqueducts were, moreover, defended by many strong breast 
works at the gates, and before reaching them. As we 
had expected, we found the four tracks unusually dry 
and solid for the season. 
<p></p>
Worth and Quitman were prompt in pursuing the 
retreating enemy the former by the San Cosme aqueduct, and the latter along that of Belen. Each had 
now advanced some hundred yards. 
<p></p>
Deeming it all-important to profit by our successes, 
and the consequent dismay of the enemy, which could 
not be otherwise than general, I hastened to despatch 
from Chapultepec, first Clarke s brigade, and then 
Cadwallader's, to the support of "Worth, and gave 
orders that the necessary heavy guns should follow. 
Pierce's brigade was,, at the same time, sent to Quitman, and in the course of the afternoon I caused 
some additional siege pieces to be added to his train. 
Then after designating the 15th Infantry, under Lieutenant-Colonel Howard Morgan, the colonel, had 
been disabled by a wound at Churubusco as the garrison of Chapultepec, and giving directions for the care 
of the prisoners of war, the captured ordnance and 
ordnance stores, I proceeded to join the advance of 
"Worth, within the suburb, and beyond the turn at the 
junction of the aqueduct with the great highway from 
the west to the gate of San Cosme. 
<p></p>
At this junction of roads, we first passed one of 
those formidable systems of city defences, spoken of 
above, and it had not a gun ! a strong proof, 1. That 
the enemy had expected us to fail in the attack upon 
Chapultepec, even if we meant anything more than a 
feint ; 2. That in either case, we designed, in his 
belief, to return and double our forces against the 
southern gates, a delusion kept up by the active demonstrations of Twiggs with the forces posted on that 
side ; and 3. That advancing rapidly from tht reduction of Chapultepec, the enemy had not time to shift 
guns our previous captures had left him, comparatively, but few from the southern gates. 
<p></p>
Within those disgarnished works, I found our troops 
engaged in a street fight against the enemy posted in 
gardens, at windows and on housetops all flat, with 
parapets. Worth ordered forward the mountain how 
itzers of Cadwallader's brigade, preceded "by skirmish 
ers and pioneers, with pick-axes and crow-bars, to force 
windows and doors, or to burrow through walls. The 
assailants were soon on an equality of position fatal to 
the enemy. By eight o clock in the evening, Worth had 
carried two batteries in this suburb. According to my 
instructions, he here posted guards and sentinels, and 
placed his troops under shelter for the night, within 
the San Cosme gate (custom-house.) 
<p></p>
I had gone back to the foot of Chapultepec, the point 
from which the two aqueducts begin to diverge, some 
hours earlier, in order to be near that new depot, and 
in easy communication with Quitman and Twiggs, as 
well as with Worth. 
<p></p>
From this point I ordered all detachments and 
stragglers to their respective corps, then in advance ; 
sent to Quitman additional siege guns, ammunition, 
intrenching tools ; directed Twiggs's remaining brigade 
(Kiley s) from Piedad, to support Worth ; and Captain 
Steptoe s field battery, also at Piedad, to rejoin Quitman's division. 
<p></p>
I had been, from the first, well aware that the 
western or San Cosme, was the less difficult route to 
the centre and conquest of the capital ; and therefore 
intended that Quitman should only manoeuvre and 
threaten the Belen or southwestern gate, in order to 
favor the main attack by Worth knowing that the 
strong defences at the Belen were directly under the 
guns of the much stronger fortress, called the citadel, 
just within. Both of these defences of the enemy were 
also within easy supporting distance from the San Angel (or Nino Perdido) and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san antonio" rel="city">San Antonio</a> gates. 
Hence the greater support, in numbers, given to 
Worth's movement as the main attack. 
<p></p>
Those views I repeatedly, in the course of the day, 
communicated to Major- General Quitman ; but being 
in hot pursuit, gallant himself, and ably supported by 
Brigadier-Generals Shields and Smith'shields badly 
wounded before Chapultepec and refusing to retire as 
Well as by all the officers and men of the column, 
Quitman continued to press forward, under flank and 
direct fires, carried an intermediate battery of two 
guns, and then the gate, before two o clock in the after 
noon, but not without proportionate loss, increased by 
his steady maintenance of that position. 
<p></p>
Here, of the heavy battery 4th Artillery Captain 
Drum and Lieutenant Benjamin were mortally wound 
ed, and Lieutenant Porter, its third in rank, slightly. 
The loss of these two most distinguished officers the 
army will long mourn. Lieutenants I. B. Moragne 
and William Canty, of the South Carolina Volunteers, 
also of high merit, fell on the same occasion besides 
many of our bravest non-commissioned officers and 
men, particularly in Captain Drum s veteran company. I cannot in this place, give names or numbers ; 
but full returns of the killed and wounded of all 
corps, in their recent operations, will accompany this 
report. 
<p></p>
Quitman, within the city, adding several new defences to the position he had won, and sheltering his 
corps as well as practicable, now awaited the return 
of daylight under the guns of the formidable citadel, 
yet to be subdued. 
<p></p>
At about four o clock next morning (September 14), 
a deputation of the ayuntamiento (city council) waited 
upon me to report that the Federal Government and 
the army of Mexico had fled from the capital some 
three hours before, and to demand terms of capitula 
tion in favor of the church, the citizens, and the mumcipal authorities. I promptly replied, that I would 
sign no capitulation ; that the city had been virtually 
in our possession from the time of the lodgments effected by Worth and Quitman the day before ; that I re 
gretted the silent escape of the Mexican army ; that I 
should levy upon the city a moderate contribution, for 
special purposes ; and that the American army should 
come under no terms, not s^Z/^-imposed such only as 
its own honor, the dignity of the United States, and 
the spirit of the age, should, in my opinion, imperiously demand and impose. 
<p></p>
For the terms so imposed, I refer the department to 
subsequent general orders, Eos. 287 and 289 (para 
graphs 7, 8, and 9, of the latter), copies of which are 
herewith enclosed. 
<p></p>
At the termination of the interview with the city 
deputation, I communicated, about daylight, orders to 
Worth and Quitman to advance slowly and cautiously 
(to guard against treachery) toward the heart of the 
city, and to occupy its stronger and more commanding 
points. Quitman proceeded to the great plaza or 
square, planted guards, and hoisted the colors of the 
United States on the national palace containing the 
Halls of Congress and Executive apartments of Federal 
Mexico. In this grateful service, Quitman might have 
been anticipated by Worth, but for my express orders, 
halting the latter at the head of the Alameda (a green 
park), within three squares of that goal of general 
ambition. 
<p></p>
The capital, however, was not taken by any one or 
two corps, but by the talent, the science, the gallantry, 
the vigor of this entire army. In the glorious conquest, all had contributed early and powerfully the 
killed, the wounded, and the fit for duty at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a>, Cerro Gordo, Contreras, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san antonio" rel="city">San Antonio</a>, Churubusco (three battles), the Molinos del Key, and Chapultepec as much as those who fought at the gates of 
Belen and San Cosme. 
<p></p>
Soon after we had entered, and were in the act of 
occupying the city, a fire was opened upon us from the 
flat roofs of the houses, from windows and corners of 
streets, by some two thousand convicts, liberated the 
night before, by the flying Government joined by, 
perhaps, as many Mexican soldiers, who had disbanded 
themselves and thrown off their uniforms. This unlaw 
ful war lasted more than twenty-four hours, in spite of 
the exertions of the municipal authorities, and was not 
put down till we had lost many men, including several 
officers, killed or wounded, and had punished the miscreants. Their objects were to gratify national hatred ; 
and, in the general alarm and confusion, to plunder the 
wealthy inhabitants particularly the deserted houses. 
But families are now generally returning ; business of 
every kind has been resumed, and the city is already 
tranquil and cheerful, under the admirable conduct 
(with exceptions very few and trifling) of our gallant 
troops. 
<p></p>
This army has been more disgusted than surprised 
that, by some sinister process on the part of certain in 
dividuals at home, its numbers have been, generally, 
almost trebled in our public papers beginning at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>. 
<p></p>
Leaving, as we all feared, inadequate garrisons at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a>, Perote, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=puebla" rel="city">Puebla</a> with much larger 
hospitals ; and being obliged, most reluctantly, from 
the same cause (general paucity of numbers) to abandon <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a>, we marched [August 7-10] from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=puebla" rel="city">Puebla</a> 
with only ten thousand seven hundred and thirty-eight 
rank and file. This number includes the garrison of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a>, and the two thousand four hundred and twenty-nine men brought np by Brigadier-General Pierce, 
August 6. 
<p></p>
At Contreras, Churubusco, etc. [August 20], we had 
but eight thousand four hundred and ninety-seven men 
engaged after deducting the garrison of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=san augustin" rel="city">SAN AUGUSTIN</a> 
(our general depot), the intermediate sick and the dead ; 
at the Molinos del Jftey (September 8), but three brigades, with some cavalry and artillery making in all 
three thousand two hundred and fifty-one men were 
in the battle ; in the two days September 12 and 13 
our whole operating force, after deducting again the 
recent killed, wounded, and sick, together with the 
garrison of Mixcoac (the then general depot) and that 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tacubaya" rel="city">TACUBAYA</a>, was but seven thousand one hundred and 
eighty ; and, finally, after deducting the new garrison 
of Chapultepec, with the killed and wounded of the 
two days, we took possession (September 14) of this 
great capital with less than six thousand men ! And I 
reassert, upon accumulated and unquestionable evidence, that, in not one of these conflicts, was this 
army opposed by fewer than three and a half times 
its numbers in several of them, by a yet greater 
excess. 
<p></p>
I recapitulate our losses since we arrived in the basin of Mexico : 
<p></p>
August 19, 20 : Killed, 137, including 14 officers. 
Wounded, 877, including 62 officers. Missing (probably killed), 38 rank and file. Total, 1,052. September 8: Killed, 116, including 9 officers. Wounded, 
665, including 49 officers. Missing, 18 rank and tile. 
Total, 789. 
<p></p>
September 12, 13, 14 : Killed, 130, including 10 
officers. Wounded, 703, including 68 officers. Missing, 
29 rank and -file. Total, 862. 
<p></p>
Grand total of losses, 2,703, including 383 officers. 
<p></p>
On the other hand, this small force has beaten on 
the same occasions, in view of their capital, the whole 
Mexican army, of (at the beginning) thirty-odd thousand men posted, always, in chosen positions, behind 
intrenchments, or more formidable defences of nature 
and art ; killed or wounded, of that number, more than 
seven thousand officers and men ; taken 3,730 prisoners, 
one-seventh officers, including thirteen generals, of 
whom three had been presidents of this republic ; captured more than twenty colors and standards, seventy- 
five pieces of ordnance, besides fifty-seven wall pieces, 
twenty thousand small arms,* an immense quantity of 
shots, shells, powder, etc., etc. 
<p></p>
Of that enemy, once so formidable in numbers, 
appointments, artillery, etc., twenty-odd thousand have 
disbanded themselves in despair, leaving, as is known, 
not more than three fragments the largest about two 
thousand five hundred now wandering in different 
directions, without magazines or a military chest, and 
living at free quarters upon their own people. 
<p></p>
General Santa Anna, himself a fugitive, is believed 
to be on the point of resigning the chief magistracy, 
and escaping to neutral Guatemala. A new President, 
no doubt, will soon be declared, and the Federal Congress is expected to reassemble at Queretaro, one hundred and twenty-five miles north of this, on the Zacatecas road, some time in October. I have seen and 
given safe conduct through this city to several of its 
members. The Government will find itself without 
resources; no army, no arsenals, no magazines, and 
but little revenue, internal or external. Still such is 
the obstinacy, or rather infatuation, of this people, 
that it is very doubtful whether the new authorities 
will dare to sue for peace on the terms which, in the 
recent negotiations, were made known by our minister 
<p></p>
In conclusion, I beg to enumerate, once more, with 
due commendation and thanks, the distinguished staff 
officers, general and personal, who, in our last operations in front of the enemy accompanied me, and communicated orders to every point and through every 
danger. Lieutenant - Colonel Hitchcock, Acting In 
spector - General ; Major Turnbull and Lieutenant 
Hardcastle, Topographical Engineers ; Major Kirby, 
Chief Paymaster ; Captain Irwin, Chief Quartermas 
ter ; Captain Grayson, Chief Commissary ; Captain H. 
L. Scott, Chief in the Adjutant-General s Department ; 
Lieutenant "Williams, Aide-de-Camp ; Lieutenant Lay, 
Military Secretary, and Major J. P. Gaines, Kentucky 
Cavalry, Yolunteer Aide-de-Camp. Captain Lee, Engineer, so constantly distinguished, also bore important 
orders from me (September 13) until he fainted from a 
wound and the loss of two nights sleep at the batteries. 
Lieutenants Beauregard, Stevens, and Tower, all wound 
ed, were employed with the divisions, and Lieutenants 
G. W. Smith, and G. B. McClellan, with the company 
of Sappers and Miners. Those five lieutenants of 
engineers, like their captain, won the admiration of 
all about them. The Ordnance officers, Captain Huger, 
Lieutenants Hagner, Stone, and Eeno, were highly 
effective, and distinguished at the several batteries; 
and I may add that Captain McKinstry, Assistant 
Quartermaster, at the close of the operations, executed 
several important commissions for me as a special volunteer. 
<p></p>
Surgeon-General Lawson, and the medical staff 
generally, were skilful and untiring in and out of fire, 
in ministering to the numerous wounded. 
<p></p>
To illustrate the operations in this basin, I enclose 
two beautiful drawings, prepared under the directions 
of Major Turnbull, mostly from actual survey. 
I have the honor to be, etc., etc., 
<p></p>
* Besides those in the hands of prisoners. The twenty thousand new 
muskets (British manufacture) found in the citadel, were used in a novel 
way. Iron being scarce in the interior, the barrels made excellent shoes 
for our horses and mules, and the brass cuffs or bands were worked up 
into spear heads for the color-staffs, and spurs for the cavalry and all 
mounted officers.
