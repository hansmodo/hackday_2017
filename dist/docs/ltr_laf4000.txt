My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am very unfortunate in my attempts to meet you, but hope at last to have better success, and sincerely wish it 
to happen about the middle of next month, when I hope to wait upon Congress at their next meeting. 
</p><p>
Until a few days ago, I had no doubt but to hear you had accepted the appointment conferred upon you. My 
fears, however, have been raised, and with my usual frankness [ assure you that your refusal could not but be attended 
with very bad circumstances. Setting compliments apart, I am sensible of the great injury such a denial would cause 
to the public, not only on account of the loss made by the United States in your person, but also for other motives. 
I hope you will accept ; I know you must: but in case you are not determined. 1 had rather change my plans than not 
to see you before you write to Congress. I wish much to hear from you at New- York, where I expect to be about the 22d. 
</p><p>
My most affectionate respects wait upon Mrs. Jay. With every sentiment of regard and attachment, I have the honour to be 
</p><p>
Your sincere friend, 
</p><p>
