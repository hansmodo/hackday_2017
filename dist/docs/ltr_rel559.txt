My Dear Mr. Worsley:  In a letter just received from my nephew, Mr.
Childe, I regret to learn that, at his last accounts from you, you
were greatly indisposed.  So great is my interest in your welfare
that I cannot refrain, even at the risk of intruding upon your sickroom,
from expressing my sincere sympathy in your affliction.  I trust,
however, that ere this you have recovered and are again in perfect
health.  Like many of your tastes and pursuits, I fear you may confine
yourself too closely to your reading.  Less mental labour and more
of the fresh air of Heaven might bring to you more comfort, and to your
friends more enjoyment, even in the way in which you now delight them.
Should a visit to this distracted country promise you any recreation,
I hope I need not assure you how happy I should be to see you at
Lexington.  I can give you a quiet room, and careful nursing, and a
horse that would delight to carry you over our beautiful mountains.
I hope my letter informing you of the pleasure I derived from the
perusal of your translation of the Iliad, in which I endeavoured to
express my thanks for the great compliment you paid me in its
dedication, has informed you of my high appreciation of the work.
</p><p>
Wishing you every happiness in this world, and praying that eternal
peace may be your portion in that to come, I am most truly, Your
friend and servant,
</p><p>
