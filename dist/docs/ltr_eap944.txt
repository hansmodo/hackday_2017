Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>:--I received your very interesting letter by Mr. Prizer and every word it contained made a deep impression on my heart. It will be a pleasure to read it when you are in a distant land. Hope is a cheering thing. My greatest pleasure will be to look forward to the future when we shall meet again. I was glad to hear the vessel is not going to sail until Tuesday as it will give you time to make such preparation as will be necessary to your comfort hereafter. Be sure to take care of your health, for with it you can enjoy everything; without it you can enjoy nothing. Money is a very convenient thing but if you should not be successful, do not be discouraged. If you have your health and return to America, you will find even little West Chester large enough to make a comfortable living, for you have ambition and enterprise enough to earn a living where other people can.

I return many, many thanks for your likeness. You could not have sent me anything which would have
been half so valuable. When I look upon it, it will serve to call up pleasant recollections of the past. But I shall need nothing to remind me of you. The likeness is most excellent but what an unspeakable pleasure it would have been to have taken one more look at the original. I must bear the trial and keep it to myself. I must appear cheerful and indifferent while my anxiety for your future comfort is beyond description. Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>, it is my earnest wish that when you are in a distant land you will find a friend in every stranger. There are many hardships you will have to bear, but you know all that before you start so you must bear them cheerfully. In your letter you speak of the pledges that have been made between us, and that you can never change. If it is a true saying that from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks, I can say that in you I have realized all my hopes of a firm and true friend, and that you have my affections entirely. My feelings will never change toward you till death shall separate us.
</p><p>
I wish you would keep a journal of every day's transactions and when you write in it, tell particularly of your comforts, your privations, your seasickness, everything just as it is. I expect there will be many changes in your absence, but I will endeavor to keep an account of them and when I write to you, give them all.

My sister came up in the steam car yesterday. She told me she has regretted so much that she did not give you a few little things that are of no value in themselves, but which you could not obtain after you have left us. She wishes you would go to her house and get a little bundle of old rags and some salve that will cure everything in the shape of a cut, bruise or burn, that she had for you, but felt a delicacy in offering. And Sister
forgot to mention mustard in the list. Do not neglect to take a pound.

The news from the gold mines is certainly favorable. No one doubts that there is plenty of gold there. But do not forget what I told you, that gold cannot buy health.
</p><p>
Take a Bible with you which will be the best and most profitable book you can read, and trust in Providence for a safe return. Now I must bid you a long and sad farewell. It is hard to separate but I trust it is all for the best. Lastly, I shall repeat that I wish you all the success, all the good luck, all the prosperity that has ever fallen to the lot of man. And if all should fail, be not discouraged. Hope for the best.

Miss Bradshaw, Mr. Prizer and I were out taking a little walk last evening. I know you think nothing of that because he was a friend to me while you were here and I hope he will continue to be. I am expecting him every moment to call for my letter, as he said he would put it in his envelope. I remain,
</p><p>
Yours truly and sincerely,
</p><p>
