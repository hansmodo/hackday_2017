Hi everyone:  Just thought I'd let you know that after a successful two
weeks of respite stay at the VA nursing home, <a href="results.php?tla=dse">Uncle Dan</a> came home, all
was fine and the next night he fell in the bedroom.  <a href="results.php?tla=mke">Mike</a> and I got him
back in bed, but by morning he couldn't roll over or sit up, because of
pain in the right hip.  We ended up with the paramedics taking him to
Stanford Hosp. ER, and it took them 8 hrs to decide he has a chip
fracture of the hip, and admit him.  He does not need surgery, but a lot
of rehab and physical therapy to regain mobility, and is to be non weight
bearing on the right side for several weeks.  On Tues. he was transferred
to Los Altos Subacute Rehabilitation Ctr. on Fremont Rd. near the Rancho
Shopping ctr., a very nice skilled nursing care facility.  It will be a
challenge to get his cooperation for  the therapists, as the poor dear
doesn't really understand commands and instructions, and has no idea of
what is going on.  Strangely, he's become very verbal all of a sudden,
and amused <a href="results.php?tla=mke">Mike</a> and me with long tales, which don't make any sense
because of the aphasia!  Today he kept talking about his <a href="results.php?tla=jpe">brother</a>!  He has
also sprinkled in a lot of four letter words and "colorful phrases" that
he thinks are quite funny!  I try to go over twice a day for several hrs.
love to all
                                                                 <p>
