About one o'clock Saturday night one of the vessels came near to us and we spoke her. She was a Danish brig, from Santa Cruz to Copenhagen. Five different sails were in sight in the morning, apparently bound in the same direction that we are, but they left us towards evening. The Captain accounts for our meeting so many vessels all at once by saying that in case of a calm, vessels will come together at some certain point. On account of contrary winds and calm we were enabled to make but little or no progress on our way, being driven too much in a northeastern direction, but the wind has now veered around to the northwest, just the direction we have been wanting it, and our course is now southeast. We have had several showers. The sky was covered with clouds in
different directions and vivid flashes of lightning were seen at a distance. Before breakfast this morning a beautiful rainbow stretched itself across the heavens, presenting a pretty picture, indeed, and one well calculated to be admired by those who had never seen the like before on the vast deep.

Yesterday the Association held a meeting and each member secured the professional services of Dr. Harris for two years by paying one dollar and sixty-three and a half cents.

We have seen a number of small flying fish. I suppose they derive their name from the fact that they rise up out of the water and fly along over its surface for hundreds of yards, and then dart under the waves again. They are a great curiosity. They seem to use their fins as wings. About twilight a large school of grampuses came floating lazily toward us, sporting within a few rods of the vessel. They would weigh, I suppose, from eight hundred to a thousand pounds each. It was quite diverting to see these huge monsters of the deep jump six or eight feet out of the water and then come down with a tremendous splash. The passengers have been successful in taking two large dolphins by hook and line.

The moon now shines until bedtime and adds greatly to the beauty of the evening. Sometimes I lie on deck in reverie, viewing her sweet countenance and thinking I can almost hold communion with loved ones left behind. I have just been out on the forecastle and listened to a number of sentimental songs by the sailors.

We are now in latitude 35 deg. N. and longitude 51 deg. W.observation taken by the moon, though usually taken by the sun.

I fear that ere morning I shall feel under the weather.
