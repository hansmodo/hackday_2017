MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
I HAVE just received from the post office your letter of 
the 20th by Briesler, who went to carry one for you. 
I write by every post, i. e., by Monday's and Thurs 
day's, which are the only ones on which mails are 
made up for any place beyond <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and the only 
ones on which letters arrive here from any place be 
yond that city. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Adams, your new daughter, behaves prettily in 
her new sphere. I dined with them one day, and 
promised to take my lodgings with them the next 
time. Mrs. Adams showed me an elegant bed, 
which she politely said she had made up for me. As 
to the details in which you say the ladies excel us, I 
have not patience. I, who have the patience of Job, 
have not patience to write letters in the style of Grandison and Lovelace. You would admire to see with 
what serenity and intrepidity I commonly sit and hear. 
Not all the froth can move my contempt, not all the 
sedition stir my indignation, nor all the nonsense and 
delirium excite my pity. If dignity consists in total 
insensibility, I believe my countenance has it. B., 
however, tells me he can always perceive when I 
don t like any thing. It must be by reasoning from 
what he knows to be my opinion. My countenance 
shows nothing, for the most part. Sometimes I believe it may be legible enough. The reflections upon 
peace, by Madame de Stael, are not here. 
</p><p>
The President and Presidentess always send their 
regards to you. Madame invites you to come next 
summer to <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a> and visit the federal city. 
I am almost afraid to write it to you for fear it should 
turn your head, and give you thoughts and hopes of 
accepting the invitation. I told Madame la Presidente that, after the year <a href='/results.php?year=1800'>1800</a>, when Congress should sit at Washington, and that city became very great, I 
thought it not impossible that you and your sister Cranch might seriously entertain such a project, for 
the sake of making a visit to <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a> as well 
as seeing Mrs. Cranch's grandchildren. 
</p><p>
Always write me how Mrs. Briesler and her children are. It makes the good man's countenance 
shine so bright when I tell him of it, that I take a 
great pleasure in reading these paragraphs to him. 
My mother I am anxious to hear of. My duty to 
her, and love, compliments, &c., &c., to whom you 
please. 
</p><p>
Always yours, 
</p><p>
