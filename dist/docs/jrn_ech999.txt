Yesterday ended the old and today begins a new year. The past has been an eventful one to us all and will most likely be remembered as such by us as long as remembrance continues. What vicissitudes we may be called on to pass through during the one just begun none of us can anticipate or conjecture with the least degree of certainty, and this being the case it is useless for me to speculate. Last evening a few of us secured half a dozen old muskets belonging to the ship, and loaded them well and awaited the hour of twelve. As the bell commenced tolling, a volley was fired off the after-cabin that made the welkin ring, and the performance concluded by wishing each other "a happy New Year," and drinking the same to our sweethearts and wives. I did an extensive washing to conclude the old year. The washing was done most beautifully and with little trouble by hanging the clothes out into the water and towing them a little while. In this manner woolen or cloth can be washed in as good if not superior manner to any other, but much care must be taken not to drag them until they ravel and go to pieces.

This afternoon Mr. M. went to Mr. H.'s stateroom and requested Mrs. H. to hand him some large quills belonging to him, which she did. Mr. Rogers being in the cabin at the time and looking that way as though he was watching their motions, she exclaimed to him, "What are you looking at me for, you dd sn of a bh!" or words to this effect. This circumstance was mentioned to Mr. H. and he
immediately went to M. and some words ensued. In the evening while Mr. M. was writing, he had occasion to use his knife and after doing so, laid it down near him; soon after he looked for it but it was missing. Mrs. Sterling, who was sitting near, had observed Mrs. H. take it away and told him so, and he requested Mrs. Sterling to go and ask her for it as she might commit some folly with it. Mrs. Sterling immediately went to her and requested her to give it up. At first she refused to do so and said that she would be her own avenger"that she had pretty near fixed him (H.) yesterday." At this the Captain came up and asked her if she had the knife. She told him she had, and gave it up, saying that "it didn't matter much about the knife."
