My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your highly esteemed & interesting letters of the 24th  & 26th ins 
inclosing one in part froMrob & dear Ann, were duly rec d & alth the 
latter appears to write somewhat despondingly, yet it may be & I 
hope her nervousness is in a great measure if not entirely owing to her 
anxiety about those she is so deeply interested in, in this quarter, & as 
that cause has in a great measure passed away, she will find herself much 
better, & when she next writes you, it will be in a much more cheerful 
strain The greatest difficulty seems to be in her case, is the manage 
ment of the boys, which no doubt is attended with much anxiety & 
trouble to her ; and the expenses of the place, as well as that of dressing 
& educating the children, which no doubt added to other expenditures 
must be very heavy, & perhaps may become more so ; but they must be 
met as far as your means will permit, & if they are not sufficient, the 
expenses must be brought down to them. The next inquiry will or 
ought to be will your means be increased or diminished by quitting the 
service, as you must still live, educate, dress & feed your children in or 
out of the army ; I think you have acted wisely in referring the subject 
of laving or remaining in the army to Ann ; if she decides in favor of 
the first, and you adopt it, of cours she will have to be contented after 
wards come what may. The greatest difficulty seems to me is the boys, 
they require the advice as well as the direction of a father, at the same 
time you could only place them in situation to prepare them to sustain 
themselves hereafter ; it can hardly be expected you could be constantly 
near them, until they arrive at years of discression. Robs letter is very 
well written, but I am affraid he is attempting too many branches at the 
same time ; he is no doubt talented & with proper instruction & education will make quite a talented or at any rate a distinguished person, 
should he take the proper turn.

I very much regret to hear you was and had been unwell for several 
days ; I hope however it will not prove a serious attack & with a little 
care in addition to some simple remedies you will, if it is not already the 
case, very soon be restored to your usual health The weather here 
has been dreadful for many days, raining & blowing a gale for some time 
which with bad tents & wet & mudy ground to pitch them on, has made 
us all quite miserable, as well as added to the sick list I have felt very 
much for the poor fellows who were wounded & are at Fort Polk, as well 
as the sick every where, the first would have been badly off any where, 
in the best quarter, but exposed as they must have been to the wet & wind 
of the late tedious bad weather, must have added greatly to their suffer 
ings. The sun made however its appearance yesterday & is likely to do 
so to-day, which I hope if it has no other effect will impart cheerfulness 
to us all. The Rio Grande is now very high, up to the top of its banks 
in many places, & might now be navigated with boats of the largest size 
as high as we wished to go, but unfortunately we have none here up to this 
time of any description, nor are we likely to have ; this campaign must 
be a failure owing to the ignorance of some in regard to some matters, & 
the imbecility of others, for all of which I shall be made the scape goat. 
The 12 months volunteers it appears are arriving at Brazos Santiago in 
thousands, faster than they can be landed, what are to be done with them 
when they all arrive which must be several thousand, or become of or 
done with them, I am unable to say. The last mail by the Alabama 
brought me an app 11 of Majr Gen by brevet, as well as a communication 
from the Secretary of War that I had been selected to command the army 
on the Rio Grande, & to conduct & direct the war against Mexico ; the 
first I was not anxious for, nor made no efforts to obtain it directly or 
indirectly, & consider the honor greatly overbalanced by the accompanyment, the duties which have been assigned me, which I neither wished or 
expected, & which I would have avoided had I been consulted in the 
matter ; but I now see no other alternative & will go throug with it with 
zeal & energy if not with ability. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> should have at once come 
out & taken the com d here, as soon as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">the President</a> intimated his wishes 
that he should do so ; by hesitating & throwing obstacles in the way in 
regard to doing so whether real or imaginary, he disgusted the Secretary 
of War as well as Mr Polk, 1 as well as many others, some of whom were 
his friends, without meeting with or gaining the approbation of any body ; 
so much so, that he was at once relieved from the com d which has I again 
say to you, been assigned to me contrary to my wishes, & permitted to 
remain in Washington, which will in all probability have the effect if not 
to break him down, as this com d will assuredly me, will have the effect it 
seems to me to blight all his prospects for the presidency.

As regards your dep c there is no doubt many abuses exist in it, but 
not more so than in every other at Washington, and alth your lot has 
been a hard one in many respects, yet I do not consider it more so than 
many others who have held themselves above asking favors from those 
in power. We are all of us too apt to consider our lots or cares the 
hardest ; I really consider few if any individual in the army has done 
more, or that more, or as much has been required of them as myself; but 
it may be said I have high rank, if so, I have earned it, by toil, danger 
& privations without complaining or troubling those in higher places, but 
putting them at defiance on all & every occasion, & if Ann & the children 
were pleasantly located where there were proper schools, it is pretty much 
all that should concern you ; you must expect to tak your share of duty 
in this country, which all in the corps should participate in, & as you 
have commencd others in a great while will if from no other cause be 
compelled by public opinion to take their turn. Should I be so fortunate 
as to get through this war without loss of reputation I may go to Wash 
ington, in which cas I may have an opportunity of remarking on some 
of the abuses there, & those in the medical dept among others, whether 
you are in or out of the corps. I expect Col Taylor will be at Fort Polk 
in a week or two as I have rec d the copy of an order sending him here. 
I truly regret Ann should permit her feelings to be operated on in the 
slightest manner, in regard to Dr T his staying or leaving <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Detroit" rel="city">Detroit</a> 
out to be a matter of perfect indifference to her ; as much so, as if he 
was not in existance ; I thought she was more of a Christian, as well as 
posessed too much dignity to indulge in or give way to such feelings in 
such or similar cases ; when I see her I shall admonish her for the same 
</p><p>
I have not read or seen all the correspondence between Genl s Gaines, 
Scott & Mr Marcy ; & if Gen S. has charged Gen. G. with being crazy, 
he can with great propriety return the compliment ; the first has been 
ordered to Washington to explain his conduct while in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a>, & 
report says if he can justify himself, he will be assigned to duty in the 
north or east, perhaps in the city of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">N. York</a> 
</p><p>
The passage of & altering the bill by the lower house of the the 
one which originated & passed in the senate on the subject of increasing 
the number of genl s was no doubt in part aimed at Gen S. & should it 
pass, which I do not expect, may have the effect of getting him out of 
the service I have no aspirations to reach the head of the army, & if 
this war can be once closed, I wish to have as little to do with public 
matter as possible ; at the same time have no objections to be laid on the 
shelf. I apprehend Dick is on board the Alabama & feel great uneasi 
ness about him as well as others on board of her but at the same time 
hope for the best ; if safe she will doubtless be in, in the course of today. 
</p><p>
Since I commenced writing your note of the 2y th was rec d which 
was a few hours since, & I had hoped to have heard you were on the 
mend, but it seems you were still confined to your bed; but I hope as 
soon as your medicine has operated that you will be able to get on your 
feet as well as to resume your duties. You may say to my friend Gen 
Hunt that I shall not interfere with the election referred to in any way 
or shape, nor shall I ever be a candidate for the presidency, or would I 
have it, if tendered me without opposition. 
</p><p>
In regard to your letter of the 24th  in regard to the outrages com 
mitted by the Texas volunteers on the Mexicans & others, I have not 
the power to remedy it or apply the corrective, I fear they are a lawless 
set I regret I have not a n. paper to send you ; all that have reached 
me, have been loaned out, & none returned & I had as well look for a 
needle in a hay stack as to recover them. I hope the Alabama is in & 
has brought you an abundant supply. I thank Gen Swift 1 & family for 
their kind congratulations & wish you to say so to young S. when you 
write him. My love to Ann & the children when you write them. 
</p><p>
Yours truly & sincerely
