This place is completely overrun by soldiers passing and repassing. Friday night five stayed here, 
last night two more, and another has just gone. One, 
last night, a bashful Tennesseean, had never tasted 
sugar-cane. We were sitting around a blazing fire, 
enjoying it hugely, when in answer to our repeated 
invitations to help himself, he confessed he had never 
eaten it. Once instructed, though, he got on remark 
ably well, and ate it in a civilized manner, considering it was a first attempt.

Everything points to a speedy attack on Port 
Hudson. Rumors reach us from <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> of 
extensive preparations by land and water, and of 
the determination to burn <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> as soon as they 
reach it, in revenge for the looms that were carried 
from <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> there, and which can soon be put 
in working order to supply our soldiers, negroes, and 
ourselves with necessary clothing. Of two evils, if 
<a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> is to be overrun by Yankees, and 
<a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> burned, I would rather await them at 
home.
