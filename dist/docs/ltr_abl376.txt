<p><i>From a Letter to William H. Herndon. Washington. June 22, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1848">1848</a></i></p>

<p>As to the young men. You must not wait to be brought forward by the
older men. For instance, do you suppose that I should ever have got into
notice if I had waited to be hunted up and pushed forward by older men?
You young men get together and form a &quot;Rough and Ready Club,&quot; and have
regular meetings and speeches. Take in everybody you can get. Harrison
Grimsley, L.A. Enos, Lee Kimball and C.W. Matheny will do to begin the
thing; but as you go along gather up all the shrewd, wild boys about
town, whether just of age or a little under age&mdash;Chris. Logan, Reddick
Ridgley, Lewis Zwizler, and hundreds such. Let every one play the part
he can play best,&mdash;some speak, some sing, and all &quot;holler.&quot; Your
meetings will be of evenings; the older men, and the women, will go to
hear you; so that it will not only contribute to the election of &quot;Old
Zach,&quot; but will be an interesting pastime, and improving to the
intellectual faculties of all engaged. Don't fail to do this.</p>
