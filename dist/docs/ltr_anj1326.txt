SIR: That frankness, which, I trust, has always characterized me through 
life, towards those with whom I have been in the habits of friendship, induces me to lay before you the enclosed copy of a letter from William H, Crawford, Esq., which was placed in my hands on yesterday. The submission you will perceive, is authorized by the writer. The statements and 
facts it presents being so different from what I had heretofore understood 
to be correct, requires that it should be brought to your consideration. 
They are different from your letter to Governor Bibb, of Alabama, of the 
13th May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>, where you state <a href="/results.php?tla=anj" rel="me">General Jackson</a> is vested with full 
power to conduct the war in the manner he may judge best," and different, 
too, from your letters to me at that time, which breathe throughout a spirit, 
of approbation and friendship, and particularly the one in which you say, 
( I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th 
ultimo, and to acquaint you with the entire approbation of the President of 
all the measures you have adopted to terminate the rupture with the Indians." My object in making this communication is to announce to you 
the great surprise which is felt, and to learn of you whether it be possible 
that the information given is correct; whether it can be, under all the circumstances of which you and I are both informed, that any attempt seriously 
to affect me was moved and sustained by you in the cabinet council, when, 
as is known to you, I was but executing the wishes of the Government, 
and clothed with the authority to "conduct the war in the manner I might judge best." 
</p><p>
You can, if you please, take a copy: the one enclosed you will please return to me. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, very respectfully, 
</p><p>
Your humble servant, 
</p><p>
