SIR: 
</p><p>
Inclosed is a eommission to command the King's Tree Company, and 
hope you will accept of it ; and let no trifling matter induce you to 
refuse it. In these times when our country calls for men of bravery 
and ability, such as you, no good man, well-wisher to his country, ought 
to resign or shun the service, and it gives me great pleasure to see you 
at the head of a company, which I know will be led on by a man whose 
conduct and spirit I have been an eye-witness of, whom I have always 
had the highest opinion of, and the greatest regard for. 
I am sir, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
