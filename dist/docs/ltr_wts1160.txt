Dear Brother: I have daily telegraphed to General 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a> our progress, and have no doubt you have kept 
pace with our movement. Johnston had chosen Dalton 
as his place of battle, but he had made all the roads to 
it so difficult that I resolved to turn it, so I passed my 
army through a pass twenty miles south of Dalton and 
forced him to battle at Resaca. That, too, was very strong, 
but we beat him at all points, and as I had got a bridge 
across/ the Oostenaula below him and was gradually getting to his rear, he again abandoned his position in the 
night and I have been pushing my force after him as fast 
as possible; yet his knowledge of the country and the 
advantage of a good railroad to his rear enabled him to 
escape me, but I now have full possession of all the rich 
country of the Etowah. We occupy Home, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=kingston" rel="city">Kingston</a>, 
and Cassville. I have repaired the railroad to these 
points and now have ordered the essential supplies forward to replenish our wagons, when I will make for 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=atlanta" rel="city">Atlanta</a>, fifty-nine miles from here and about fifty from 
the advance. Johnston has halted across the Etowah at 
a place called Allatoona, where the railroad and common 
road passes through a spur of the mountain, making one 
of those formidable passes which gives an army on the 
defensive so much advantage, but I propose to cross the 
Etowah here and to go for Marietta via Dallas. Look 
at your map and you will see the move. We expect to 
cross the Etowah on the 23d, when we will move straight 
on fighting when opposed. Of course our laboring and difficulties increase as we progress, whereas our enemy gains 
strength by picking up his rear guard and detachments. 
</p><p>
Put forth the whole strength of the natio^i now, and if 
we can't whip the South we must bow/ our necks in 
patient submission. A division of our territory by the 
old lines is impossible. Grant surely ?s fighting hard 
enough, and I think this army will make) its mark. 
</p><p>
Your brother,
