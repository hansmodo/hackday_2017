Sir,
</p><p>
I have been honored with your letter, and the books which accompanied
it, for which I return you my hearty thanks. America cannot but be
flattered with the choice of the subject, on which you are at present
employing your pen. The memory of the American Revolution will be
immortal, and will immortalize those who record it. The reward is
encouraging, and will justify all those pains, which a rigorous
investigation of facts will render necessary. Many important facts,
which preceded the commencement of hostilities, took place in England.
These may mostly be obtained from good publications in that country.
Some took place in this country. They will be probably hidden from
the present age. But America is the field where the greatest mass of
important events were transacted, and where, alone, they can now be
collected. I therefore much applaud your idea of going to that country,
for the verification of the facts you mean to record. Every man there
can tell you more than any man here, who has not been there: and the
very ground itself will give you new insight into some of the most
interesting transactions. If I can be of service to you, in promoting
your object there, I offer myself freely to your use. I shall be
flattered by the honor of your visit here, at any time. I am seldom from
home before noon; but if any later hour should suit you better, I will
take care to be at home, at any hour and day, you will be pleased to
indicate.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir,
</p><p>
your most obedient, humble servant,
</p><p>
