MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ezk" rel="met friend">LIZZIE</a> : I received a very pleasant note from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=frd" rel="met friend">Mr. F. Douglass</a> on yesterday. 
I will reply to it this morning, and enclose it to you to hand or send him immediately. In this morning's Tribune there was 
a little article evidently designed to make capital against me just now that three of my 
brothers were in the Southern army during the war. If they had been friendly with me they 
might have said they were half brothers of Mrs. L., whom she had not known since they were 
infants ; and as she left Kentucky at an early age her sympathies were entirely Republican that 
her feelings were entirely with the North during the war, and always. I never failed to urge my 
husband to be an extreme Republican, and now, in the day of my trouble, you see how this very 
party is trying to work against me. Tell <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=frd" rel="met friend">Mr. Douglass</a>, and every one, how deeply my feelings 
were enlisted in the cause of freedom. Why harp upon these half brothers, whom I never knew 
since they were infants, and scarcely then, for my early home was truly at a boarding school. 
Write to him all this, and talk it to every one else. If we succeed I will soon send you enough 
for a very large supply of trimming material for the winter. 
</p><p>
Truly,
