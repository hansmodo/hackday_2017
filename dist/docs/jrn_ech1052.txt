In almost every camp and city in the country, the most respectable portion of the community have formed what are called "Vigilance Committees" which appoint officers, organize courts, catch rascals, try them and, when found guilty, punish them by whipping, banishing or hanging. Frightful disorders
prevail, for California has been scourged by as desperate bands of villains as the whole world could produce. For a long time they have preyed upon us, and our laws, on account of their loose administration and many technicalities, have been found inadequate to the protection of life and property.
</p><p>
A large Vigilance Committee is being organized here and we shall soon have a full police of our best citizens standing guard all the while. Early this morning a meeting of the citizens of Sonora was held preparatory to forming this Committee. Major Ross was called to the Chair and myself appointed Secretary. The following resolutions were adopted:
</p><p>
Resolved, That no members be admitted to this association except they be unanimously elected.
</p><p>
Resolved, That ten gentlemen be selected to act as a police for the night.
</p><p>
Resolved, That the police have a private watch word, "Action!"
</p><p>
Resolved, That three successive blows on a gong be a signal for the assembling of the committee, and at the sound thereof the committee should assemble opposite Mr. Holden's house. The central watch was instructed to procure a gong.
</p><p>
Resolved, That secrecy should be observed as to the doings of this committee by the members thereof.
</p><p>
Resolved, That if called upon by the People's Police of Camp Seco, this committee respond by lending their aid.
</p><p>
Resolved, That a committee of five be appointed to draft constitution and by-laws and report tomorrow evening.
</p><p>
Resolved, That we meet tomorrow evening at early candlelight.
</p><p>
About 11 o'clock this morning the person arrested in Sonora last evening on Jim Hill's evidence, was taken over to Camp Seco, accompanied by Sheriff Work and others. A form of examination was gone through and no positive evidence other than that of the doomed man appearing against him, he was honorably acquitted.
</p><p>
After 6 P.M. Hill was led forth to execution. Since early morning, people from the various camps had been on their way to Camp Seco and an immense number of accomplices and other villains had collected. After the prisoner was placed on the stand, he made a few remarks describing his life as one of crime, and warning others against following his course. He also said that he had robbed and stolen and done other acts of crime, but had never shed blood, and he threw himself upon the mercy of the people. This appeal to the people caused the question to be put amongst them, "Shall he be hung?" A large number answered aye, but an equal number responded in the negative. Immediately some hundreds of pistols were drawn and a universal stampede occurred. Horsemen plunged through the crowd and over them, and the people ran in every direction.
</p><p>
George Work, the sheriff, arrived at this point and asked to be heard in his capacity as conservator of the peace. He pledged his own life that the prisoner should be forthcoming at the District Court, if the people would deliver him into the hands of the civil authorities. In the excitement and confusion that followed, the prisoner was taken from the stand, his hands all the while pinioned behind him, and he was thrust into a wagon which was immediately driven off at a rapid rate for Sonora.
</p><p>
News of the result having reached here shortly after the rescue, Mr. Edwards and Mr. Linoberg with a
gong passed through the city and called a meeting of the people in front of Mr. Holden's store. Mr. Edwards then addressed the crowd in a short but very effective speech, referring to the escapes of criminals heretofore, and the danger of our citizens while such thieves and rascals were permitted to escape. He proposed to take the prisoner as soon as he might arrive in town and hang him. There was not a dissenting voice. The crowd then prepared with weapons, to meet the sheriff and the prisoner at the entrance of the city.
</p><p>
They came in a wagon, with two persons alongside on horseback, with pistols drawn. But all was of no avail. The men in that crowd were not to be frightened. They followed the wagon driving at a rapid rate until it struck against a post, it being dark. George Work then jumped out with the prisoner, holding him by the collar, and both ran at full speed for the jail, plunging through the arroyo, while the crowd behind was shouting, "Stop him in front. We are afraid to shoot, lest we may kill our friends. Stop him in front!" Mr. Linoberg soon caught the prisoner behind and hung on to him, compelling him to drag him along and thus impeding his progress. Col. Cheatam also ran ahead at full speed to the jail and planting himself before the door, cocked his revolver, and as George Work and the prisoner came running up, he placed one hand on the prisoner and presenting his pistol towards George, said, "George, you have a pistol and I have a pistol. Yours is cocked and so is mine. Blow away. I can kill toobut let this man go!" Others by this time came up and one party taking George, another the prisoner, no shots were exchanged and the prisoner was snatched from the hands of the law. Sheriff Work was not inimical to the hanging of the robber Hill, but
owing to his official position, he could do no less than make an effort to lodge the prisoner within the door of the jail.

However, two persons threw a rope over the prisoner's neck, and away he was led to the execution. The place selected was a limb of a noble old oak behind the El Dorado in the middle of the city. A minister was requested and 15 minutes allowed, the prisoner being surrounded by a ring of firm men who were cool and determined in the work before them. The fifteen minutes having expired, the signal was given and in an instant the wretched man was hanging by his neck. There was scarce a struggle. The crowd was deeply impressed, but all were satisfied of the righteousness and necessity of the punishment. After the body had been cut down and placed in the rough box, it was discovered that the receptacle was too small for the corpse and it was necessary, in order to nail down the lid, that half a dozen of those present stand on top of the lid and work it back and forth a number of times before it could be fastened down. I was one of those selected and I can truthfully say it was a gruesome task.
