CARSON CITY, October 4th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1869">1869</a>.
  
There are many points of interest in and about Carson. Not only the neighboring silver mines, but the graceful scenery of the winding valley, the mountains and their deep gorges interwoven with the lights and shadows cast by the reflected rays of the sun, the whispering pines, the mountain rills, the wild flowers that "waste their sweetness on the desert air," all combine to lend "enchantment to the view."
</p><p>
And what adds still greater interest to the fascinations of this charming little city, is the delightful society one may find here, especially among the "upper ten," a class of refined and cultivated people, who are just aristocratic enough, and yet democratic enough, to make themselves exceedingly pleasant and agreeable in all their social relations, and popular generally among their fellow citizens. The ladies we met, while in the
city, fully convinced us that elegant and refined women may be found in the West as well as in the East. The ladies of Carson, at least many of them, are fine specimens of true womanhood, and are characterized by good taste and good sense, as well as by cordiality and elegance of manners. The kind and polite attentions we received, during our visit of a few days, will ever be remembered with gratitude; yet cannot be repaid with mere words of acknowledgement.

From Carson we made an excursion, in company with our friends, to Lake Tahoe, which is embosomed in the summits of the mountains, fifteen miles from the city. It is the most elevated lake on this continent, being six thousand feet above the level of the sea. It is reached by a turnpike, which winds its way up the mountains by angular lines, commanding at every turn magnificent views, and which cost the company that built it a hundred and forty thousand dollars. It is used, principally, for transporting pine lumber by teams from the mountain heights to the valley. Most of the teams employed consist of six or eight pairs of mules or oxen, and each team draws two, and sometimes three wagons, attached by chains, and carries from thirty to sixty tons to the load. In regions where there are no roads, they transport timber and fire-wood down the mountains
through flumes, constructed of plank, and into which streams of water are conducted, floating the wood and timber, stick by stick, for miles, and going at a rushing rate. The mountains are covered with dense forests of pine, and stand so huddled, and yet so independent of each other, as to resemble great earth-bubbles, inflated, I doubt not, by the action of subterranean fires, at some remote period in the earth's history. What is singular, the largest pines grow on the summits of the mountains, owing, perhaps, to the fact that they catch more sunlight than the smaller pines on the lower grades. Or it may be, the mountains were lifted up but halfway at the first convulsion, thus giving the summit pines a longer time to attain their growth.

Lake Tahoe is certainly a beautiful gem--the most beautiful that ever glittered in the crown of a mountain monarchy. Its waters are as clear and pure as crystal. It is said to be more than two thousand feet deep; and though it receives several streams, it has no outlet. You can see fish and pebbles glimmering in its depths, as in a mirror. It is quite a large lake, being thirty miles long and ten or twelve broad; nor was it made in vain. San Francisco is agitating the question of monopolizing its waters for the use of its citizens, by conducting it in iron pipes to the city, a distance
of a hundred and fifty miles, and at a cost estimated at twelve millions of dollars. Its borders are wild and romantic. It is surrounded by snow-capped mountains, which are reflected in the mirror of its waters. Ragged rocks, looking like armed giants, stand out here and there along its margin, as if to guard the spot from intrusion. Though located in a region of perpetual frost and snow, its waters never freeze; but why they should not, is a mystery. In summer it is a place of popular resort. The mountain air is pure, cool, and exhilirating. No invalid can breathe it without feeling its invigorating influence. Indeed its restorative influence is like the fabled elixir of life, it makes one, however old he may be, feel youthful, if not absolutely frolicsome. There is a small steamboat that plies on the lake, for the benefit and pleasure of visitors, and on both sides of the lake there are several first-class hotels, which furnish excellent accommodations for summer guests and pleasure parties. We stopped at the Glenbrook House, which commands a fine view of the lake and its scenery. The lake abounds in silver trout, so called because they are dotted with silver stars; a fresh-caught one, weighing six pounds, supplied us with an excellent dinner. The table was loaded with all kinds of luxuries, including
the best of California fruits, and attended by a Chinese waiter.

Glenbrook gives name to the hotel, and runs dashing by its door, giggling and laughing like a mountain maid. On the opposite side of the glen rises Shakespeare Rock, two hundred feet high, looking like an immense statue, chiseled by human hands. It is in itself a marvel. Its apex resembles very distinctly the head of Shakespeare. The features of the face are like his in expression. The brow is crowned with a wreath of golden moss; and the eyes, nose, mouth, and chin, fully delineated. There he stands facing the lake, and gazing in mute rapture upon its placid waters. No artist could improve this portraiture of genius, which has been thus lithographed by the hand of Nature, and placed on exhibition in this lofty granite hall of her own Mountain Home.
</p><p>
Not far from the Shakespeare statue appears Cathedral Rock, which is so named from its resemblance to a Roman church. It looks so much like a magnificent church, that you imagine you can see the worshipers inside, through the gothic windows, engaged in their devotions. About three miles from Glenbrook there is a wonderful cave in a rock, which presents a bold, perpendicular front, overlooking the lake and rising to a height of four hundred and eighty feet. The cave opens
at its base and extends into the rock, like an arched passage-way, a hundred feet or more, and is high enough to admit of standing erect in it. We entered and advanced to its termination, but saw nothing except blackened, vitrified walls, and some specimens of jasper and agates. The cave was probably produced by volcanic action, and is well worth a visit.

There are many other interesting spots along the borders and in the vicinity of Lake Tahoe, which every excursionist should visit, who enjoys communion with Nature and admires her wonderful works. A few weeks spent here in summer, is worth more than a year squandered in Europe, or at a fashionable watering place in the Eastern States, so far as regards pleasure, or the attainment of health.

After enjoying the day here in the most delightful manner with our friends in sight-seeing, we returned to Carson in the evening by moonlight. We had a rapid and exciting ride down the mountains. The commingled lights and shadows that fell on our way, and on the mountain sides, and in the deep gorges, reminded us of fairy land, and produced in our minds visions of all that is magical and beautiful, not to say fearful, as we were whirled along the edges of precipitous cliffs and abrupt descents, which terminated in
unknown depths. Yet we made a safe trip of it, and reached the city at a seasonable hour in the evening, highly gratified with the experiences of the day.
