<p>
TO MRS. GENERAL MASON. 
</p><p>
I am obliged, my charming friend, to announce to you the disappointment in my 
hopes of attending your agreeable party to Alexandria, as some imperative domestic engagements forbid (to me) such an 
indulgence, I know you will be good enough to make my apology to Madame Buonaparte, and if my sister can contribute to your pleasant excursion, she will go 
with great cheerfulness. 
</p><p>
With affectionate salutations to the ladies of your house, believe me, 
</p><p>
Truly yours, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=dol" rel="me">D. P. MADISON.</a>.
