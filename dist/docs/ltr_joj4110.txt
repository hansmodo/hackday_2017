My good Friend, 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of seeing Senor Ceracchi, and 
his model of a monument in honour of the revolution. The 
design appears to me to be a noble one, worthy the attention 
of the United States, and honourable to the taste and 
talents of the artist. It cannot fail of being interesting to 
all who contributed to the revolution, and to that glorious 
triumph of liberty which it exhibited, and which well deserves a magnificent monument. The ancient republics, 
to whose very imperfections we are sometimes partial, 
afford precedents. Why should not the Congress adopt 
and carry this design into execution ? The expense ? for 
my part I think the expense proper, and therefore confide 
in the sense and sentiment of the public. If the money 
was now to be provided, the measure would be iinseasonable, on account of the Indian war. That obstacle will be 
of short duration. We need not begin the monument this 
year. To adopt the plan will cost nothing. The work 
must necessarily be long on hand, and as the expense will 
be gradually incurred, so also it will be gradually defrayed. 
The sum annually requisite can be but small compared 
with the object, and with our resQurces. Although it would 
better become the nation, than individuals, to undertake it, 
yet provided the nation assume the task, the aid of subscriptions, and even State donations, might, if necessary, be 
recurred to. If you would say, it shall be begun as soon 
as a certain sum is subscribed, there is reason to believe it 
would be subscribed. If the ways and means be referred 
to <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Hamilton</a>, he will indicate the most eligible. 
His official station, information, and talents, would render it 
proper. 
</p><p>
The gentleman who formed the design, will be the most 
proper person to execute it. Another artist would not feel 
the same degree of interest in it, nor is it certain that 
another of equal talents could easily be had. 
</p><p>
As to his reward, â€” it is a matter which I think should 
not (// present be contemplated. Let the work be finished, 
and then make him such an acknowledgment as would 
become the nation on the one hand, and him on the other. 
I can conceive of no other rule on such occasions, and in 
relation to such objects. 
</p><p>
I confess to you that the effect which this measure would 
naturally have on the president's feelings, is with me an 
additional inducement. We shall not be reproached for 
letting him die by an executioner, or in chains, or in exile, 
or in neglect and disgrace, as many Greek and Roman 
patriots died. On the contrary, we shall be commended 
throughout all generations for the part we have hitherto 
acted respecting him. It is only while he lives that we can 
have the satisfaction of offering the fruits of gratitude and 
affection to his enjoyment. Posterity can have only the 
pensive pleasure of strewing flowers on his grave. 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
