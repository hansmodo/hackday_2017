SIR, 
</p><p>
On the 1st instant I met the Honorable Assembly 
of this Colony, to deliberate on the request and pressing  reasons sent us from the Massachusetts for an 
immediate augmentation of troops from this Colony. 
Our Assembly agreed to augment with two regiments 
of seven hundred men each, who are now raising to 
join the Continental Army. It w^as wished that we 
could have the advice and direction of the Congress, 
or your Excellency, before we took this step, but 
thought the present critical situation of our affairs 
would not admit the delay of obtaining it. Since 
your arrival at camp before <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, views and considerations of their situation and circumstances, I shall 
gladly be advised, and shall attend your request 
for the hastening and marching the men. 
</p><p>
There are thirteen hundred and ninety-one barrels 
of flour come to the care of Colonel Jedediah Hunting ton, at Norwich, for the use of the army, which I 
have ordered forward. The busy season with the 
farmers renders its speedy transportation difficult. 
Please to advise of the need of hurry, and where it 
shall be ordered to be delivered. 
</p><p>
Our Assembly supplied <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>Major-General Schuyler</a> with 
fifteen thousand pounds in cash, and forty barrels of 
another necessary article. Accounts from the north 
ward are favorable. The brig Nancy, Thomas Davis, 
master, which arrived at Stonington with molasses, is 
removed to Norwich. She hath on board eighteen or 
nineteen thousand gallons. The Committee of Inspection  and Correspondence, I trust, will take proper 
care respecting both vessel and cargo. 
</p><p>
The road by my door being the nearest for post-riding  from <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I shall be obliged, whenever your Excellency has occasion to send to 
that city, if the rider may be directed this way, and to call on me, for the convenience of any despatches I may have occasion to forward by him. Fessenden 
has passed this way more than once. 
</p><p>
I am, with great esteem and regard, Sir, your obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jht" rel="me">JONATHAN TRUMBULL</a>.
