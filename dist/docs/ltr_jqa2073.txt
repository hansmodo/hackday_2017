DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Air. Wilcox has not yet been here, but sent me from Ham 
burg your favor of February II, which was the first letter I 
have been happy enough to receive from you since we left 
America. When he comes here, I shall be happy to show 
him every civility in my power. 
</p><p>
It is extremely pleasing to hear that the elections for the 
ensuing completion of the Senate have been so favorable. I 
believe the time is approaching, when even the triple brass 
of political impudence will melt away before the wisdom of 
the pacific and neutral system, which struggled with so 
many interests and so many passions before it could gain a 
firm establishment. Only one letter from me had been received by the Secretary of State, when you wrote. I had 
at that time written nearly thirty, twenty of which might 
have reasonably been supposed by me to have arrived on 
the nth of February. I have sent my letters not only by 
every vessel that has been known to me from this country, 
(and I have taken particular pains to be informed of every 
opportunity,) but from France, from England, from Ham 
burg and from Bremen. How many of my letters miscarry 
in the conveyance it is impossible for me to say; but the 
state of Europe since I came here, and especially the situation of this country, have been such as renders the transmission of letters extremely precarious. For the last four 
months almost we have been secluded from the regular means 
of communication with all Europe excepting France, and 
no dependence to be placed upon the security of that. 
Nothing can be committed to post offices, where the practice 
of reading the letters is so openly professed, that nobody 
thinks of sealing a paper sent through that channel. En- 
Sweden and Denmark are the only European powers of any magnitude, that have 
been able to preserve their nationality, and they are now reaping largely the benefits of so wise a policy. 
</p><p>
The information that my first letter was satisfactory, was 
extremely pleasing to me, because it shows that it was received with an indulgence which all my correspondence will 
need. I have, indeed, had little apprehension of incurring 
the censure of writing too little. My principal fear has been 
lest the charge of an opposite fault should be applicable, that 
of repeating many times the same observations, and descend 
ing too much into the detail of minute circumstances. In 
spite of the best possible inclination, too, and notwithstand 
ing admonition from you and intimation from Mr. Randolph, 
I have sometimes given a latitude to opinions upon actors 
and events, which perhaps will be thought indiscreet. How 
ever this may be, I presume the style of my correspondence 
must be tolerably well known by this time, and if any mate 
rial variation is desired, it will doubtless be intimated to me. 
</p><p>
The political sufferings of Messrs. Van Staphorst had no 
more effect to the detriment of our credit than their present 
power has in its favor. It did not, indeed, affect their personal credit or property. Mr. Nicholas van Staphorst, who 
on my arrival here had privately withdrawn from the pursuit 
of the then government, is now a member of the States 
General and employed in some of the most important executive committees. He is one of the most respectable men 
engaged in the public affairs at present. 
</p><p>
If the situation of an American Minister at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a> was 
not in its nature and on all common occasions tolerably 
insignificant, it would have been rendered so by the particular situation of the country since I have been in it. When 
I first arrived the government was an agonizing patient in 
the hands of Lord St. Helens. His skill was ineffectual, 
however, to save ; the patient soon expired, but its soul 
survives and waits in impatient expectation of a glorious 
resurrection. The very name of Anglomane had been long 
since entirely lost. I assure you, I have not heard the word 
pronounced since I have been in the country. And indeed 
as the circumstances were, that name would have been 
ridiculous. As well might the Helots of Lacedaemon have 
been called Spartomanes. 
</p><p>
At that time my situation was as unpleasant as it was 
unmeaning. It was impossible for me not to perceive that 
I was surrounded with that sort of malevolence, which a 
West India faithful African may be supposed to bear 
/towards the enemy of his master. It appeared in every 
shape. It was shown by the whole hierarchy of servitude, 
from the President of the States General to the hairdresser, 
from the General Pensionary to the laquais de louage. To 
this general fact the only total exception that I can mention 
was the Stadtholder himself. I had no business to transact 
with him, saw him only as a point of form, and not more 
than three or four times. I had every reason to be satisfied with his reception. From all the rest it was ill-will, 
always covered with forms of decency, often aiming at the disguise of politeness, but never successfully concealed. 
</p><p>
Since the arrival of the French armies all these appearances have changed. A friendly disposition, a desire to 
accommodate, a respect and regard for the United States 
really felt and professed with pleasure, distinguish the 
present from the past possessors of power. Personally my 
situation is far more agreeable than it was, but nothing is 
to be done. The country is conquered; its forms of independence have hitherto been more or less preserved, but 
they may be laid aside whenever their friends shall think 
proper, and have already been many times in contradiction 
with the substance. The government rose upon the basis 
of French protection ; that alone continues its existence 
and with that it would infallibly vanish. It has become 
almost universally odious to the people who consider it 
as in fact more oppressive than that which preceded. The 
French Convention have not acknowledged it, and may 
withdraw their protection, which is the breath of its life, 
whenever they find it for their interest so to do. 
</p><p>
The restoration of the Stadtholdcr sooner or later is 
inevitable, and with him must come again the subserviency 
to the mistress of the sea. In every political point of view 
the Republic will in future be nothing more than a part of France or of Britain. I am expecting orders from the 
Secretary of State for my own regulation, and until I shall receive them I shall not venture to transact any business whatever. . . . 
</p><p>
Among the mille et une revolutions of France, the union 
of the Jacobins and the Royalists is one of those at which 
our Jacobins will perhaps be, or affect to be, the most 
surprised. That they are at present united in the object 
of their pursuit is unquestionable. That they will succeed 
is far from being improbable. The alliance of anarchy and 
despotism is perfectly natural, and the leading members of 
the Convention are convinced at length that Democracy 
will answer the purpose of declamation much better than 
those of government. "II faut se depouiller des prejuges 
de la Revolution," says Thibaudeau, "car si la Revolution 
a detruit des prejuges, elle en a aussi enfante." But they 
have not yet got over their passive obedience to the opinion 
publique of the moment, and of course they still proscribe 
what they adored, and adore what they proscribed in the 
interval of a single day. Such a system may properly be 
styled a democracy, but to call it a government would be 
making a violent misapplication of words. 
</p><p>
I am, &c.
