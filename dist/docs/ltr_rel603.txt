<p><i>[Biographer's note: In another letter to me, of May 26,

<p>
...I will state, at the outset, that I desire you to consider Romancoke
with its appurtenances your own; to do with as you consider most to
your interest; to sell, farm, or let; subject, however, to the
conditions imposed by your grandfather's will, as construed by the
decree of the Court of Appeals of Virginia, which declares, 'If the
legacies are not paid off by the personal property, hires of slaves,
rents, and sale of the real estate, charged with their payment, at the
end of five years, the portion unpaid remains a charge upon the White
House and Romancoke until paid.  The devisees take their estates cum
onere.
</p><p>

The result of the war having deprived the estates of the benefit of
the hire of the slaves and the sale of Smith's Island, and the personal
property having all been swept off by the Federal armies, there is
nothing left but the land of the two estates named.  A court might
make some deduction from the amount of the legacies to be paid in
consideration of these circumstances, and I should think it would be
fair to do so.  But of that I cannot say.  Now, with this understanding,
make your own arrangements to suit yourself, and as you may determine
most conducive to your interests.  In confirming your action, as the
executor or your grandfather, I must, however, take such measures as
may be necessary to carry out the purpose of his will....  If you are
determined to hold the estate, I think you ought to make it profitable.
As to the means of doing so, you must decide for yourself.  I am unable
to do it for you, and might lead you astray.  Therefore, while always
willing to give you any advice in my power, in whatever you do you
must feel that the whole responsibility rests with you....  I wish,
my dear son, I could be of some advantage to you, but I can only give
you my love and earnest prayers, and commit you to the keeping of that
God who never forgets those who serve Him.  May He watch over and
preserve you.
</p><p>
                        Your affectionate father,
