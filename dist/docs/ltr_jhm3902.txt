SIR : 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 10th inst. came safe to hand two days ago. The 
commanders of privateers, knowing their authority, and regardless of our 
unfortunate situation, are determined to add to our distresses, instead 
of contributing towards their relief; indeed, the men who usually command these vessels are needy and avaricious to the last degree, and 
come out with a view of making money by any means that does not 
subject them to be hanged; humanity is a thing they are totally unacquainted with. By a late Act of Congress, all British property, where 
soever found, is made liable to seizure. How far the vessel in question, 
having <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>'s flag, might have violated, I will not pretend to 
judge, if it is put upon this issue; thus its rests with <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> to 
take cognizance of the affair. But in the light the matter at present 
strikes me, we have gone far enough in confining the captain and crew; 
more rigorous measures may probably bring us into a dispute with the 
State of North Carolina. What we have already done is a mere act of 
power, and in our circumstances highly excusable. I would, therefore, 
recommend that the captain and crew be discharged, and the vessel 
be permitted to depart as soon as the flag has sailed, and got beyond all 
danger of being taken. I should be extremely glad if you could con 
tract for any quantity of clothing from the quarter you mention, and I 
will engage to have produce returned for it that is, if it can be spared. 
I have employed Mr. Robert Heriot to take an account of the provisions in the district of <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>; as soon as I can get his return, I 
shall be able to let you know what rice is to be spared. All the south 
ward parts of the country are stripped very bare, and it is very probable 
we shall be obliged to draw some provisions from San tee for this army. 
The same objection lies against paying Mr. Wayne's account. Until I 
can get the return above mentioned, I enclose you an order on Capt. Richardson, at the high hills of Santee, for 500 Ibs. powder and 1,500 
lead, 50 muskets and bayonets, 50 cartouch boxes, and 1,000 flints, which 
you may send for as soon as you please. As to cannon ball, I know 
not where to procure them; if you can point any mode that promises 
a probability of success, I will undertake to have the experiment made. 
I have already wrote you fully respecting Mr. Porcher; also, respecting Maham's and <a href='/results.php?tla=peh' rel='colleague'>Horry's</a> corps, and my determination about impressing 
horses. Mr. John Waring's situation at present being so exceedingly 
distressing, I have given him permission to remain at home, on his 
engaging to join you again as soon as possible. Mrs. Hall sends on a 
horse for his wagon ; I, therefore, request you would furnish the necessary escort, and send it forward without delay. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your most obedient servant,
