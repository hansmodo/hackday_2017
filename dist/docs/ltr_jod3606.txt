MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
IT is painful to feel an impulse to write where there 
is nothing to say. I write merely to let you know 
that I am alive and not sick. The weather has been 
cold for several days, which is more tolerable, at least 
to me, than the heat which we suffered for a day or 
two the beginning of the week past. The new French 
minister is arrived. Whether he has any budget to 
disclose has not yet appeared, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a> is in fine spirits and his health improves. 
I should suppose he will remain here till the fate of 
his treaty is determined, which we hope, with some 
doubts however, will happen before the end of this 
week. Twenty-nine senators attended yesterday, 
and the thirtieth is expected to-morrow. We shall 
meet for the future at an earlier hour in the morning. 
The deliberations have been temperate, grave, decent 
and wise hitherto, and the results judicious. My absence from home at this season would be less distressing or rather less insipid, if my presence here was 
more necessary, or indeed of any utility, but to the 
mortification of separation from my family and affairs 
at a time when they would be most agreeable to me, 
is added the consciousness that I can do no good to 
others any more than to myself. I have no voice, 
and although the fate of the treaty will not be justly 
imputable to me in any degree, yet there is reason to 
expect that many will suspect me and others charge 
me with a greater share of it than would belong to 
me if I had a voice. All these things terrify me little.

A Mr. Millar, a son of a Professor Millar of Glasgow, known by his "Historical view of the English 
Government" last night brought me a letter of introduction and recommendation from Dr. Kippis, who 
desires his " sincere respects to every part of my 
family." In the midst of the desolations of Europe, 
he " rejoices in the prosperity of America, and in the 
wisdom and moderation of its two chief Governors." 
So much for compliment. Moderation, however, is 
approved only by the moderate, who are commonly 
but a few. The many commonly delight in some 
thing more piquant and lively. I am, with desires 
rather immoderate to be going home with you, 
</p><p>
Your's forever, 
</p><p>
