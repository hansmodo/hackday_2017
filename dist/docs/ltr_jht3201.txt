SIR, 
</p><p>
The time, when the arrival of the fleet under the 
command of the <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count de Estaing</a> may be expected, 
being so far advanced that the utmost readiness to 
cooperate with him is become necessary, should he 
appear on this coast, and the immediate danger to 
which our own seaports will be exposed from the 
collected force of the enemy, should he be prevented 
from coming this way, have prevailed to induce the 
General Assembly of this State to order the militia, requested by your Excellency, to be assembled at the 
places of rendezvous proposed, as soon as possible. 
</p><p>
Should the advanced season, or any other unforeseen cause, prevent the <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count</a> from coming this way, 
and the intended enterprise against the enemy at New 
York be laid aside, the frontiers and sea-coasts of this 
State will be eminently exposed to the ravages and 
depredations of the enemy. We would flatter ourselves it will be in your Excellency's power to send a part of the troops, under your command, into this 
State, to take post so as to cover and protect the 
most exposed part of our sea-coasts and frontiers ; and 
desire you to inform us whether we may expect that 
our hopes and wishes, in this respect, may be realized. 
</p><p>
The keeping up large guards of the militia on the 
coasts, besides the enormous expense attending, injures 
the public service by withdrawing the men from the 
field, and lessening our ability to supply the army 
with men or provisions. But, I persuade myself, I 
need not use arguments to prevail upon your Excellency to indulge our request, if consistent with the 
public service and a due regard to the general interests of the States. I am, with great esteem and 
regard, my dear General, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
