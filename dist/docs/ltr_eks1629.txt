June 4, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>. 
</p><p>
My last letter went under the charge of a strong 
escort and I think will reach you but I feel little 
encouragement to write now as it is very probable it 
will only be labor thrown away. . . . 
</p><p>
June p. I have been rather unwell for a week or 
two and yesterday while on review was taken suddenly sick and compelled to leave the parade. I have 
a regular intermittent fever. Today is my well day 
and I am to take a large dose of quinine tonight, which 
Dr. Satterlee thinks will cure me. How my head 
ached all last night! . . . Merrill whom I saw on 
the eighth is sick looks like death and is wasted to 
a very skeleton though he has no well defined 
disease. We hear that reinforcements are expected 
and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> says he will eat his Fourth of July 
dinner in Mexico. The reports from the city are very 
contradictory, and so far as the public are concerned 
are not to be relied upon. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> may have 
reliable information though I doubt it. 
</p><p>
June 11. Last night when I went to bed I took 
twenty grains of quinine and went to sleep hoping 
that I should escape any more fever, but long before 
morning I waked half crazy, my teeth chattering, 
with a most tremendous ague followed by a fever and 
a headache that made all crack again. . . . My fever 
has now subsided and I feel tolerably well again though 
weak. In the midst of my paroxysm our chaplain 
called upon me and gave me a lecture from the text: 
" Whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth." . . . You 
ask me in one of your letters whether my statement of 
the number killed at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a> or the newspaper 
account, " sixty-five," is correct. The sixty-five in 
cludes all the wounded, many of the wounds being 
mere scratches. It is now said that twelve were 
killed, and I had put down the number ten. . . . 
</p><p>
June 17. My birthday I am forty years old. . . . 
An American can scarcely appreciate the glorious 
freedom and blessings of his native land unless he has 
been banished as I have for months where everything 
is stamped by ignorance, vice, and misery. . . . 
</p><p>
June 20. On General Court Martial for several 
days past. Feel well, though still very weak. We 
hear from all quarters that the Mexicans, more than 
twenty thousand strong, are prepared to oppose our 
march to the Capital. We must have at least one 
tremendous battle. Welcome the danger, welcome 
the toil, welcome the fierce conflict and the bloody 
field, if it will but close the war. 
</p><p>
June 21. How sad and dreary the hours pass! 
All day upon a tedious court and nothing to interest 
us after the adjournment. The thousand lying 
rumors which are constantly circulated with regard to 
the enemy have ceased to excite the slightest attention. 
. . . One thing is certain, there will in future be 
no more comfort in army life. Peace cannot bring 
back to us those pleasant western stations they 
are lost to us forever. On our widely extended 
southern and western frontier will be many isolated 
posts far, far from civilization there it is to be 
feared our days will be passed in dreary banishment. 
</p><p>
June 23. As yet we have no certain news from the 
column advancing under General Cadwalader, but 
the Mexican rumors state that he has had a battle 
at La Hoya, in which the enemy s loss was two hundred and eighty in killed, wounded, and prisoners, 
and ours thirty. This is about the usual proportion - 
but I doubt the whole story. Lying is so universal 
here that I am almost afraid I shall fall into the habit 
myself. The Seventh Infantry moved yesterday into 
quarters near us, so I shall see my brother every day. 
</p><p>
June 24. Nothing new. Waiting for reenforcements. It is rumored that some secret negotiations 
are quietly going on. Nous verrons. We hear that 
General Pillow is at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a> but have not learned 
the number of his troops. The report that agents are 
here negotiating with Mr. Trist has gained general 
credence. I have no doubt of it, but do not expect a 
favorable result. The Mexican Congress is soon to 
meet and all depends upon the spirit which animates 
its members. 
</p><p>
June 29. Yesterday after coming from parade in 
the morning had a return of the ague and fever and 
passed a wretched day. My fever subsided towards 
evening, but by eleven o clock I had another chill and 
passed a horrible night. The fever did not leave me 
until this morning. Two paroxysms of ague and fever 
in eighteen hours is rather tough. There has been 
much sickness in the army here, thirteen hundred 
having been on the report at one time. 
</p><p>
July 6. . . . Since my last writing the prospect of 
peace has much increased, the tone of the Mexican 
papers has altered in the last week they have evidently endeavored to produce an impression on the 
public mind that peace is necessary, and as they are 
entirely controlled by those in authority it is evident 
that Santa Anna is trying to bring about a termination 
of the war. It matters not whether in this course of 
conduct he is swayed by the hope of getting hold of 
the " three million," or whether the fear of another 
defeat and the consequent loss of the Capital of the 
Aztecs weighs with him, certain it is that General 
Scott and Mr. Trist have received communications 
on this subject from the Mexican authorities, either 
through a secret agent sent to the city or through 
Mr. Bankhead the English resident minister per 
haps by both channels. Moreover we know that 
three commissioners have been nominated to meet 
those who have authority to act for our government. 
Nothing, however, can be done but by the authority 
of the Supreme Congress which commences its sessions day after tomorrow. If the peace party headed 
by the great One-legged can influence this turbulent 
popular assembly we may hope for favorable results. 
I am by no means sanguine in my hopes of a peace or 
even an armistice without much more bloodshed, and 
an entire change of policy in the conduct of the war. 
After every victory we are down upon our knees suing 
for peace, and as yet, although we have defeated their 
armies, the Mexican people have not felt the horrors 
of war, but on the contrary have actually profited 
by it. Nothing but vague rumors are heard from the 
column advancing under General Pillow. 
</p><p>
July 7. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> says that the chances for 
peace are three to one and many sanguine spirits here 
are rejoicing in the prospect. The advance of Pillow's 
column arrived this evening bringing the long, anxiously expected mail, which contained yours of the 
eleventh and twenty-fourth of May. . . . We in the 
Fifth are all much shocked by the death of Captain 
Whipple who breathed his last in the Castle of Perote. 
</p><p>
He was deservedly the most popular officer in the 
regiment, and will be remembered by his companions 
with affectionate regret. . . . Colonel Mclntosh arrived with the command yesterday; I was glad to see 
him. He appears in fine health. . . . Our information, though not of recent date, gives much cause to 
fear for the officers of our regiment in Detroit. Steven 
son, who will be promoted by Whipple s death, it is 
said, is in wretched health, and cannot long survive. 
Norvell is considered in a hopeless state, and poor, 
nervous, irritable Whitall has entirely lost the use of 
one of his arms and is so miserable that he cannot 
leave the house. I sent you a letter by an express 
Mexican who was hired at a high price to carry it to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a>. I paid two dollars for my share, but am 
doubtful whether it ever reaches you such uncertain chances are all we can have for the future. It is 
now the twenty-fourth of July, so now you see from 
mere hopelessness I have discontinued my journal. 
During some days we have all thought that a peace 
was about to be made the news from Mexico and 
every deduction from common sense warranted the 
conclusion. It seems evident that if under existing 
circumstances, with their armies defeated, a great 
portion of their country in our possession and ten 
thousand of our troops within six days march of their 
Capital, they refuse to negotiate, they will continue 
to do so until their entire country has been conquered, 
which will take years, blood and treasure. Today all 
our fond anticipations are destroyed. Their Congress 
has dissolved without any definite action on the subject, and Santa Anna s proclamation for the defence 
of the city has reached us. Does the fool think he 
can keep ten thousand Yankees from entering it? 
True, many will be killed in the battle under the walls 
or in the streets, but Victory will never desert our 
ranks to consort with these filthy Mexicans, unless 
her taste is much depraved. I now despair of leaving 
this country for years. Bitter, most bitter is the conviction that such is to be my fate, and I can but wish 
that none were united to me and compelled to be 
miserable on my account. . . . Alas, the chance is 
I shall never see you again ! 
</p><p>
We are not to leave <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=puebla" rel="city">PUEBLA</a> until after General 
Pierce arrives and where our course will be directed 
after the fall of the Capital, no one can tell. There 
is still much sickness in the army my health is, 
however, perfectly reestablished, though I am like 
most others here, extremely thin. Ruggles is quite 
sick. Have I ever mentioned that he is writing a 
history of the war ? Won t it be a literary curiosity ? 
Colonel Mclntosh is before a Court of Inquiry on his 
conduct while commanding the escort and train from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a> to the National Bridge. The General has 
refused to give him the command of a brigade and 
as he has not assumed that of his regiment, he is just 
at present nobody. Poor old man! he should never 
have been permitted to come here. . . . 
</p><p>
July 29. We are in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=puebla" rel="city">PUEBLA</a> still and no day fixed 
for advance, though <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> says he will show 
us the Capital by the eleventh of August. Day before 
yesterday a brigade under General P. Smith was or 
dered to the rear on the Orizaba road to meet and 
support General Pierce whom it is reported is threat 
ened by four thousand of the enemy, and yesterday 
we learned that General Pierce is not on the Orizaba 
road, but has probably by this time reached Perote. 
Today we hear that General Smith has changed his 
direction to La Hoya at which strong defile they may 
possibly have a fight with the Mexicans. We cannot 
march until they arrive, and we are all anxious to see 
them and the mail they will bring. When on duty 
as field officer of the day, I have a wide circuit of 
guards and quarters to visit, located in every part of 
the city. 
</p><p>
Several of the regiments are quartered in monas 
teries, of which there are at least a dozen in the city. 
They are much alike in appearance; very large stone 
buildings constructed in the most massive manner 
and entirely unlike anything in our country. I be 
lieve I am getting into a scrape by attempting a 
description of these strange, indescribable houses. To 
each one is attached a large church rich with statuary, 
paintings, gilding, and numerous votive offerings. 
</p><p>
These churches all have domes and tall spires which 
contain from eight to thirty-two large bells. Imagine 
what a clatter there is when they are all ringing 
together, which is not unusual, particularly on any 
favorite Saint s day. The main building of the 
Monastery of San Francisco they are all named 
after saints is a succession of rectangles, two or 
three stories high, surrounding areas or paved courts 
in the centre of which plays a never-ceasing fountain 
and in which are planted fruit and flowering trees and 
shrubs. Around each area are broad balconies supported on heavy, stone arches, into which open the 
dormitories and other apartments. These dormitories or cells are usually about fifteen feet square, 
having but one window. Between these rooms in the 
interior of the building are long, narrow halls, badly 
lighted and ventilated, branching off to the different 
suites of cells in the various rectangles. On all these 
halls open rooms as they do in one of our large hotels; 
halls and rooms seem to be never ending and form a 
perfect labyrinth. The main galleries and apartments 
contain hundreds of oil paintings. Around one of the 
areas I counted forty-eight pictures, eight by twelve 
feet in size, with figures the size of life, all of a religious character. In some, gods, angels, men, and 
devils are strangely mingled. Among so many paint 
ings there must be, of course, a number which are 
very indifferent, but others are well worthy of study 
and will bear criticism. The kitchens, stables, and 
various offices are arranged in the basements. To the 
San Franciscan Monastery there is a large garden 
tastefully arranged, with a stone summer house in the 
centre surmounted by a Moorish dome. On the ex 
terior of these buildings there are few or no windows, 
the massive walls and heavy gates completely cutting 
off the inmates from the world. It had a peculiar, old-world-like appearance to me when I first saw the 
monks (the lazy drones), in their long robes and deep 
hoods, noiselessly creeping through the dimly lighted 
galleries. I was officer of the day yesterday, and 
while on my rounds last night, a little after twelve, in 
passing through one of the back streets I was attracted 
by the sound of music accompanied by a strange kind 
of wailing which issued from the open door of rather 
an inferior house. I rode up to it and was much 
struck by the strange scene. The room was in a blaze 
of light from many candles. In its centre was a bier 
on which was extended the corpse of a girl apparently 
about seventeen, dressed in all the finery the family 
possessed, with flowers in her bosom, hair, and hands, 
and surrounded by gilded ornaments, probably borrowed from the churches. In one corner of the room 
was a group of old women, perfect hags, squatted 
round a furnace where a feast was cooking. They 
looked like so many witches round a cauldron. In the 
opposite corner was a display of liquors and drinking 
cups, which the appearance of the inmates proved had 
not been suffered to stand idle. Immediately round 
the corpse were several couples dancing a fandango 
to the merry fiddle, while ever and anon the witches 
round the cauldron, with their shrill, cracked voices, 
howled a chant in the Indian, Tlasculan-language. 
The whole was evidently a strange commingling of the 
Romish superstitions and the ancient Indian funeral 
rites. . . . 
</p><p>
August 6. . . . I hardly think you will ever see 
these pages, or the hand which guides the pen may 
be cold in death before they reach you. . . . One of 
the most brilliant affairs of the war occurred at the 
village of San Juan, which is about five miles from 
the National road to the north of Ojo de Agua. General C. F. Smith sent Captain Ruff with a party of 
eighty-two mounted rifles on a scout to this place. 
On entering the village he was fired upon from the 
houses and a church where two hundred Infantry and 
one hundred guerillas were strongly posted. Ruff 
immediately dismounted his men and leaving twenty- 
four with the horses led the rest to the attack - 
breaking into the houses sword in hand. The Mexicans were soon routed and fled leaving forty-three 
dead, and it is said over fifty wounded. Their stand 
ard was captured and the public stores and arms in 
the place destroyed. Captain Ruff took no prisoners, 
and in this short but bloody fight lost but one man. 
</p><p>
The order for the march to the Capital is published. 
The First division under Twiggs leaves on Saturday 
the eighth; the Second under Quitman the next day; 
ours, Worth s, on Monday the tenth, and the rest on 
Tuesday the eleventh. Altogether it is a feeble command for the work before it. Ten thousand troops to 
conquer a city containing near three hundred thousand inhabitants. We shall do it, but perhaps pay 
dearly for it. I think within ten days we shall have 
reached within striking distance, have made our dispositions, and commenced the attack. . . . 
</p><p>
August 8. I have been all day preparing for the 
march which commences at daylight tomorrow. I 
have been too busy to think and I am glad it is so, as 
I almost despair when I reflect upon the destitute 
situation in which you will be left, with the three 
children dependent upon you, should I fall in the 
coming battle. I shall certainly be much exposed, 
being in the leading battalion to Worth's division, 
and we confidently expect to commence the attack. 
I hope, however, to escape unscathed for which, more 
for your sake than my own, I fervently pray. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> with Uncle on his staff went forward 
this morning. The entire army is to unite at some 
point on the route, when in all probability our division 
will lead. I shall try every night to record the incidents of the march as they will interest you if they 
ever reach you. About twenty-five hundred sick are 
to be left here. Colonel Childs remains as command 
ing officer and governor. Dr. Wright has today been 
attached to our battalion, so I am pretty sure if I am 
to have a leg cut off that it will be done scientifically. 
</p><p>
August Q. At four this morning we arose and immediately after breakfast loaded the wagons and at 
six in the morning our battalion leading the Infantry 
of Worth's division marched out of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=puebla" rel="city">PUEBLA</a>. We followed a company of Dragoons and Duncan s light 
battery. Our route lay over the valley of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=puebla" rel="city">PUEBLA</a> to 
the right of Popocatepetl, our course northwest. The 
morning was clear and cold, as they always are in this 
climate, but as the sun approaches the zenith it be 
comes hot, though not oppressive as it is with you on 
a sultry summer day. We have marched all day be 
tween cultivated fields principally covered with corn 
which is standing in every stage of growth, from the 
young shoots a few inches high to fields of waving 
green with the ear nearly fit for harvest. The scenery 
on every side was beautiful in full view of the sublime 
mountains, their white, shining summits buried for 
thousands of feet in eternal snow and ice. On the left 
of the extensive plain dotted with white haciendas, 
each with its dome and tall spire, is the pyramid of 
Cholula and the extensive ruins of that large city. At 
half -past twelve we encamped at Aqua Freato. The 
camp is full of rumors in which, however, I place no 
faith. In the first place it is reported that Santa Anna 
has been killed in consequence of his correspondence 
with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a>; in the second place, that the 
Mexican trobps are fighting among themselves in the 
city under various opposing generals, and that we 
shall enter the Capital without a battle. The opinions 
on the subject are various, but my voice is still for 
war. I believe we shall have a severe, a desperate 
fight. Towards night we could see the smoke of 
General Quitman s camp far in our advance. 
</p><p>
August 10. Marched at seven, the country becoming richer and more thickly inhabited as we approached 
the mountains. All along the road, particularly at 
the watering places, the Mexican men and women 
were ready to receive us with various articles of marketing, such as fruits, vegetables, meats, etc. About 
twelve we arrived at the town of San Martin where 
we are quartered for the night. There are several 
churches, plazas, and fountains, and I should think 
from fifteen hundred to two thousand inhabitants. 
We had a strange and ridiculous scene this after 
noon. 
</p><p>
The main plaza was crowded with Mexican market 
people, our soldiers mingled among them, when some 
unaccountable fear produced an alarm, and they all ran 
in the most admirable confusion. The women with 
their hampers of truck and jars of milk and pulque 
tumbling over each other, scattering everything as 
they scattered themselves in all directions. The 
drums beat and all got under arms. Everything is 
quiet now and no one knows what caused the stampede. Adios. 
</p><p>
August 11. Marched from San Martin at half-past 
five. The morning was fine but it had rained during 
the night and the road was quite muddy. General 
Worth was informed that General Alvarez was a short 
distance on our left with fifteen thousand men, and 
some changes were consequently made in our order of 
march. A section of artillery was sent to the rear, 
the train closed up on the First Brigade, and the 
Second under Clarke immediately followed. Our road 
which was excellent passed through a rich and picturesque country rising rapidly towards the summit 
level between <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a> and Mexico, occasionally 
pitching suddenly into a deep ravine or verdant valley. 
After marching ten miles we descended a steep hill to 
the bridge of Temelucan, a fine stone work over a 
rapid mountain stream. Here commenced the Pass of 
Rio Frio, an extremely strong defile which the Mexicans would have defended, if they were a brave people. 
At this place Quitman was fired upon yesterday and 
had one man killed. Just as the rain began at three 
o clock, we reached the hacienda and tavern of Rio 
Frio, kept by a German and situated at the crossing 
of a mountain stream. We had marched nineteen 
miles and are now half way from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=puebla" rel="city">PUEBLA</a> to Mexico. 
</p><p>
The rear guard did not come up until dark. No news 
from the advance. . . . 
</p><p>
August 12. We marched from Rio Frio at six. The 
weather was very cold as it is always in this elevated 
region, though under a tropical sun. The broad, excellent road ran through a dense pine and cedar forest. 
In two hours we reached the summit of the mountain, 
ten thousand seven hundred feet above the sea. On 
our right and left were still loftier mountains towering 
high above us in the clouds. The change of vegetation 
from the tropical plants to those of the Arctic regions 
was distinctly perceptible as we advanced. The road 
plunged rapidly toward the plain and after descending 
a few miles the great valley of Mexico broke upon our 
view, a most glorious spectacle, which we beheld from 
the same point where Cortes first gazed upon it. Far 
to the right scarcely perceptible was the great city, 
and all over the vast plain spread out before us like a 
map were lakes, towns, haciendas, and large cultivated fields. We dipped into the valley by a winding 
road so steep as to be barely practicable for our 
wagons. At Cordova, just before we reached the plain, 
we found General Quitman and Shields with Tom 
Williams, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> s aid. From them we heard 
that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> was at Agotla six miles from El 
Pen on, a hill strongly fortified eight miles from the 
city, and that the engineers with a part of Twigg s 
division were reconnoitring that approach to the 
city. Quitman s division were encamped at Buena 
Vista [see map], a hacienda where the road forks, the 
right branch going direct to the city by the right of 
Lake Chalco, and the left by a longer route round the 
lake. We were ordered to the left and before night 
reached the town of Chalco, a dirty place nearly surrounded by marsh and mud. 
</p><p>
August 13, Chalco. We have not moved today. A 
reconnoissance has been going on around El Penon 
which is found to be an exceedingly strong work, so 
that if any other approach to the city can be found, 
no assault will be made upon it. It is reported that 
the Mexicans have between thirty and forty thousand 
troops to oppose our weak ten thousand. Our task is 
truly desperate, and many of us will, of course, be 
sacrificed before we take the city. Pillow's division 
arrived this afternoon. Boats have been collected 
today to enable us to cross Lake Chalco, and thus 
avoid the strong positions of El Penon and Guadalupe. About fifty scows have been found here which 
will carry forty men each and it is thought as many 
more are at Agotla. 
</p><p>
August 14. Means have been discovered to turn 
El Penon by land. A simultaneous attack is to be 
made by Worth's and Twigg s divisions on a place 
called Mexicalingo where it is supposed there are 
seventeen guns. In a reconnoissance yesterday, Lieutenant Schuyler Hamilton, Aid to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a>, and 
grandson of Alexander Hamilton, was desperately 
wounded by a lance. He was brought in this evening 
and it is thought he may recover. 
</p><p>
August 15. It has been decided to abandon entirely 
the route by El Penon and advance by the road to the 
left of Lakes Chalco and Xochimilco. We go to victory 
or death, we can only be defeated by annihilation. 
Our spirits and courage are good, we have confidence 
in ourselves, and confidence in our generals. We left 
Chalco at two o clock and proceeded round the head 
of the lake through vast corn fields. After marching 
five miles we struck the base of the mountain on the 
south of the valley, and after winding along its rugged 
side over a narrow, rough road for three miles, we 
bivouacked at a little village called Totalco. This 
morning we marched at seven continuing along the 
base of the mountain over the broken road with the 
valley and lakes on our right. We passed through 
several small villages on the marshy bank of Lake 
Xochamilco, which were completely embowered in 
olive orchards, the humble cottages built under the 
spreading branches. Far in our advance we could 
see San Augustine, Palapa, and other towns in the 
neighborhood of the city, and at one point a solitary 
spire of Mexico was visible. At eleven we were halted 
by an order brought from the rear by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> s 
Aide-de-Camp, who stated that a force of some five 
thousand of the enemy had shown themselves to the 
left of Chalco. I do not like to criticize the acts of 
the general, but think this a bad move. Having decided upon one point of attack, it seems to me we 
should have pushed on without delay, giving Santa Anna no time to strengthen his defences at a place 
where he evidently has not expected us. We are now 
bivouacked at San Gregario in an olive grove. This 
afternoon some few of the enemy have been seen by 
our pickets and tomorrow I think, if we advance, they 
must meet us. We are about fifteen miles from the 
city and must come upon some of their advanced 
batteries in the next ten or twelve miles. One should 
put his house in order with the prospect of death 
before him. . . . 
</p><p>
August 17. I am tired almost to death, but must 
say one word before I lie down. We marched this 
morning and immediately saw the enemy in our advance on the hills. Our battalion was sent forward 
to disperse them, and soon received their fire, we, 
however, rushed upon them and they fled. Our labor 
has been immense, climbing over precipices, through 
broken, craggy ground all day. We lost one poor fellow 
which was all the injury we received. After passing 
Xochimilco (pronounced Hokamilco) which we left on 
our right we saw a heavy force of infantry and cavalry 
on a point near the termination of the causeway which 
leads from that town to San Augustine. We, how 
ever, disappointed them by taking a crossroad when 
they had made every preparation for receiving us the 
other way. We slowly approached San Augustine 
which the enemy abandoned. In our skirmishes a 
few Mexicans were shot and the Governor of Mexico, 
who was heading some troops it is said, was mortally 
wounded. We entered the beautiful town of San 
Augustine about four in the afternoon. Santa Anna 
had left it a few hours before telling the inhabitants 
he could do nothing for them now but should if we 
had given him twenty-four hours more. To prove 
his kind feelings towards them he took every ounce 
of bread in the town to feed his troops. We advance 
again tomorrow and shall meet more serious opposition which must increase every step to the city. " One 
leg " vows to defend the Capital to the last extremity. 
I picked up a curious proclamation signed by him, 
written yesterday, to induce our men to desert. I 
shall enclose it in this. I saw Uncle Edmund today - 
he must needs come to the advance to try to get shot ! 
</p><p>
August 18. About nine we advanced from San 
Augustine on the direct road to Mexico via San Antonio. A squadron of Dragoons, supported by our 
battalion, moved forward with the engineers, Major 
Larkin Smith and Captain James L. Mason, to reconnoitre. The Dragoons in our front pushed forward 
rapidly and were a few hundred yards in advance of 
us when a heavy piece of artillery was discharged at 
them. Captain Thornton was instantly killed and 
the guide wounded. This occurred at ten in the morn 
ing not more than three hundred yards from where I 
am now. All day an extensive reconnoissance has been 
going on. I only came in at sunset. The result of our 
observations shows that the enemy are strongly 
posted, that the ground to the right and left is im 
practicable to artillery or Dragoons. It is possible 
we may turn their position by their right flank, and 
carry their batteries in reverse, but it must be done 
by infantry alone and against great odds. I think 
we shall try it tomorrow and we may have a bloody 
day. I am becoming anxious for the desperate effort. 
We are fairly committed Mexico must fall or we 
must all find a grave between this and the city. . . .
