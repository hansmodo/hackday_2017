THIS morning Queen Margaret, accompanied by her first 
maid of honour, Miss Franklin, set out for Rochester. Immediately on their departure, the whole street was in tears 
from a heavy shower of rain. It is whispered, that the new 
family administration, which took place on her Majesty's 
departure, promises, like all other new administrations, to 
govern much better than the old one. 
</p><p>
We hear, that the great person (so called from his enormous 
size), of a certain family in a certain street, is grievously 
affected at the late changes, and could hardly be comforted 
this morning, though the new ministry promised him a roasted 
shoulder of mutton and potatoes for his dinner. 
</p><p>
It is said, that the same great person intended to pay his 
respects to another great personage this day, at St. James's, 
it being coronation-day ; hoping thereby a little to amuse his 
grief ; but was prevented by an accident, Queen Margaret, or 
her maid of honour, having carried off the key of the drawers, 
so that the lady of the bed-chamber could not come at a 
laced shirt for his Highness. Great clamours were made on 
this occasion against her Majesty. 
</p><p>
Other accounts say, that the shirts were afterwards found, 
though too late, in another place. And some suspect, that the wanting a shirt from those drawers was only a ministerial 
pretence to excuse picking the locks, that the new administration might have every thing at command. 
</p><p>
We hear that the lady chamberlain of the household went 
to market this morning by her own self, gave the butcher whatever he asked for the mutton, and had no dispute with the 
potato-woman, to their great amazement at the change of times. 
</p><p>
It is confidently asserted, that this afternoon, the weather 
being wet, the great person a little chilly and nobody at home 
to find fault with the expense of fuel, he was indulged with 
a fire in his chamber. It seems the design is, to make him 
contented by degrees with the absence of the Queen. 
</p><p>
A project has been under consideration of government, 
to take the opportunity of her Majesty's absence for doing a 
thing she was always averse to, namely, fixing a new lock 
on the street door, or getting a key made to the old one; 
it being found extremely inconvenient, that one or other of 
the great officers of state should, whenever the maid goes out 
for a ha'penny worth of sand, or a pint of porter, be obliged 
to attend the door to let her in again. But opinions being 
divided, which of the two expedients to adopt, the project 
is, for the present, laid aside. 
</p><p>
We have good authority to assure our readers, that a Cabinet Council was held this afternoon at tea; the subject of 
which was a proposal for the reformation of manners, and a 
more strict observation of the Lord's day. The result was a 
unanimous resolution, that no meat should be dressed tomorrow ; whereby the cook and the first minister will both be 
at liberty to go to church, the one having nothing to do, and 
the other no roast to rule. It seems the cold shoulder of mutton, and the apple-pie, were thought sufficient for Sunday's dinner. All pious people applaud this measure, and 
it is thought the new ministry will soon become popular. 
</p><p>
We hear that Mr. Wilkes was at a certain house in Craven 
Street this day, and inquired after the absent Queen. His 
good lady and the children are well. 
</p><p>
The report, that Mr. Wilkes, the patriot, made the above 
visit, is without foundation, it being his brother, the courtier. 
</p><p>
Sunday, <a rel="month origin" value="9">September</a> 23. 
</p><p>
It is now found by sad experience, that good resolutions 
are easier made than executed. Notwithstanding yesterday's 
solemn order of Council, nobody went to church to-day. 
It seems the great person's broad-built bulk lay so long abed, 
that the breakfast was not over till it was too late to dress. 
At least this is the excuse. In fine, it seems a vain thing to 
hope reformation from the example of our great folks. 
</p><p>
The cook and the minister, however, both took advantage 
of the order so far, as to save themselves all trouble, and the 
clause of cold dinner was enforced, though the going to church 
was dispensed with; just as common working folks observe 
the commandments. The seventh day thou shall rest, they 
think a sacred injunction ; but the other six days thou shall 
labour is deemed a mere piece of advice, which they may practise when they want bread and are out of credit at the alehouse, and may neglect whenever they have money in their 
pockets. 
</p><p>
It must, nevertheless, be said, in justice to our court, that, 
whatever inclination they had to gaming, no cards were 
brought out to-day. Lord and Lady Hewson walked after 
dinner to Kensington, to pay their duty to the Dowager, and 
</p><p>
Dr. Fatsides made four hundred and sixty-nine turns in his 
dining-room, as the exact distance of a visit to the lovely 
Lady Barwell, whom he did not find at home ; so there was 
no struggle for and against a kiss, and he sat down to dream 
in the easy-chair, that he had it without any trouble. 
</p><p>
Monday, September 24. 
</p><p>
We are credibly informed, that the great person dined this 
day with the Club at the Cat and Bagpipes in the City, on 
cold round of boiled beef. This, it seems, he was under some 
necessity of doing (though he rather dislikes beef), because 
truly the ministers were to be all abroad somewhere to dine 
on hot roast venison. It is thought, that, if the Queen had 
been at home, he would not have been so slighted. And 
though he shows outwardly no marks of dissatisfaction, it is 
suspected, that he begins to wish for her Majesty's return. 
</p><p>
It is currently reported, that poor Nanny had nothing for 
dinner in the kitchen, for herself and puss, but the scrapings 
of the bones of Saturday's mutton. 
</p><p>
This evening there was high play at Craven Street House. 
The great person lost money. It is supposed the ministers, 
as is usually supposed of all ministers, shared the emoluments among them. 
</p><p>
Tuesday, Sept. 25. 
</p><p>
This Morning my good Lord Hutton call'd at CravenStreet House, and enquired very respectfully & affectionately 
concerning the Welfare of the Queen. He then imparted 
to the big Man a Piece of Intelligence important to them both, 
and but just communicated by Lady Hawkesworth, viz. 
that the amiable and delectable Companion, Miss D[orothea] 
B[lount], had made a Vow to marry absolutely him of the 
two whose Wife should first depart this Life. It is impossible 
to express the various Agitations of Mind appearing in both 
their Faces on this Occasion. Vanity at the Preference 
given them over the rest of Mankind; Abjection to their 
present Wives, Fear of losing them, Hope, if they must lose 
them, to obtain the proposed Comfort ; Jealousy of each other 
in case both Wives should die together, &c. &c. &c., all 
working at the same time jumbled their Features into inexplicable Confusion. They parted at length with Professions 
& outward Appearances indeed of ever-during Friendship, but 
it was shrewdly suspected that each of them sincerely wished 
Health & long Life to the other's Wife; & that however 
long either of these Friends might like to live himself, the 
other would be very well pleas'd to survive him. 
</p><p>
It is remarked, that the Skies have wept every Day in 
Craven Street, the Absence of the Queen. 
</p><p>
The Publick may be assured that this Morning a certain 
great Personage was asked very complaisantly by the Mistress 
of the Household, if he would chuse to have the Blade-Bone 
of Saturday's Mutton that had been kept for his Dinner to-day, 
broil' d or cold. He answer'd gravely, // there is any Flesh 
on it, it may be broil' d; if not, it may as well be cold. Orders 
were accordingly given for Broiling it. But when it came to 
Table, there was indeed so very little Flesh, or rather none, 
(Puss having din'd on it yesterday after Nanny) that if our 
new Administration had been as good Oeconomists as they 
would be thought, the Expence of Broiling might well have 
been saved to the Publick, and carried to the Sinking Fund. 
It is assured the great Person bears all with infinite Patience. 
But the Nation is astonish'd at the insolent Presumption, 
that dares treat so much Mildness in so cruel a manner ! 
</p><p>
A terrible Accident had like to have happened this Afternoon 
at Tea. The Boiler was set too near the End of the little 
square Table. The first Ministress was sitting at one End 
of the Table to administer the Tea; the great Person was 
about to sit down at the other End where the Boiler stood. 
By a sudden Motion the Lady gave the Table a Tilt. Had 
it gone over, the G. P. must have been scalded, perhaps to 
Death. Various are the Surmises and Observations on this 
Occasion. The Godly say it would have been a just Judgment on him, for preventing, by his Laziness, the Family's 
going to Church last Sunday. The Opposition do not stick 
to insinuate that there was a Design to scald him, prevented 
only by his quick Catching the Table. The Friends of the 
Ministry give it out, that he carelessly jogg'd the Table himself, & would have been inevitably scalded, had not the Ministress sav'd him. It is hard for the Publick to come at the 
Truth in these Cases. 
</p><p>
At six o'Clock this Afternoon, News came by the Post, that 
her Majesty arrived safely at Rochester on Saturday Night. 
The Bells immediately rang, for Candles to illuminate 
the Parlour, the Court went into Cribbidge, and the Evening 
concluded with every other Demonstration of Joy. 
</p><p>
It is reported that all the principal Officers of the State 
have received an Invitation from the Dutchess Dowager 
of Rochester to go down thither on Saturday next. But it 
is not yet known whether the great Affairs they have on their 
Hands will permit them to make this Excursion. 
</p><p>
We hear that from the Time of her Majesty's leaving 
Craven-Street House to this Day, no Care is taken to file the 
Newspapers; but they lie about in every Room in every 
Window, and on every Chair, just where the Great Person 
lays them when he reads them. It is impossible Government 
can long go on in such Hands.
