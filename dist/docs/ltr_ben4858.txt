SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city origin'>London</a>, <a rel="month origin" value="9">September</a> <a rel='day origin' value='3'>3</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1772' rel="origin">1772</a>. 
</p><p>
I write this line, just to acknowledge the receipt of your 
several favours of July i5th and i6th, containing the resolves 
of the House relating to the governor's salary, and the petition to the King. 
</p><p>
Lord Dartmouth, now our American minister, is at present 
in the country, and will probably not be in town till the season of business comes on. I shall then immediately put the 
petition into his hands, to be presented to his Majesty. I 
may be mistaken, but I imagine we shall not meet the same 
difficulty in transacting business with him, as with his predecessor, on whose removal I congratulate you and the Assembly most heartily. I shall write fully by some of the next 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ships; at present can only add, that, with the sincerest esteem and respect, I have the honour to be, &c. 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
