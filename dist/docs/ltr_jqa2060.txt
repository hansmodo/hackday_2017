THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, February 12, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Since the date of my last letter (December 21, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1794">1794</a>,) 
a revolution has taken place, the substance of which had 
been for some time expected, but the forms of which have 
been infinitely milder than had ever entered the imagination 
of any man. The French army of the North, after a brilliant and successful campaign from March till December, 
had at length reached the banks of the Waal, and was for 
several weeks arrested in its progress by the natural barriers 
which at all times have constituted the most important defence of these provinces. Just at that period a succession 
of weather almost without example both in point of severity 
and of duration fastened all the waters of the country, and 
while it constructed a safe and easy passage for the French 
Republicans into the heart of Holland, it rendered the re 
source of inundations impracticable to their enemies. 
</p><p>
The existing government of this Union was not prepared 
for an event like this. The troops of the Republic capable 
of opposing the march of the enemy were already reduced 
by the events of the war from 50,000 to less than 15,000 men. 
Of their allies the Austrians gave them but little assistance, 
the Prussians none at all, and the British were considered 
as a burthen rather than a defence. 
</p><p>
The prevalence of British councils was however unimpaired in the cabinet. It had been proposed as early as 
October to send commissioners to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> to negotiate a peace. 
A consent to receive them had already then been obtained, 
but the compliance of the British government with the 
measure was thought indispensable, and could not be obtained. 
</p><p>
It is presumed, however, that it was finally granted, as 
the measure was taken. Two Commissioners were dispatched to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, but their authority was not commensurate 
with the exigency of affairs. The speech of the King of 
Great Britain at the opening of his Parliament seems to 
disapprove the step, but his Ambassador here still continued his legislative functions, and two commissioners of 
the French Republic, who in consequence of his instructions 
had been kept in confinement since last May, were not liberated from prison, even after the departure of the deputies upon their pacific mission. 
</p><p>
The armistice which was the primary object of their 
negotiation could not be obtained. The Waal and the 
Rhine became passable upon the ice, and the passage of 
the former was accordingly effected by the French. On the 
8th of January, a council of war was held at Utrecht, consisting of the Austrian, Hanoverian, British and Dutch 
Generals, and the British Ambassador. The result of it 
was one more effort of resistance on the part of the allies. 
The actions of the 9th and loth were severe, but their 
issue only served to prove the insufficiency of the allied 
forces for the defence of this country. From that period 
they gave up the point, and have since then been employed 
in executing their retreat into Germany. The Province of 
Utrecht capitulated, and the French troops entered the city 
on the I yth. 
</p><p>
The next day the Stadtholder and his family left the 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, and embarked in fishing boats at Schevening for 
England. He had previously demanded and obtained of the 
States General the dismission of his two sons as Generals 
in the service of the Republic. He then requested and 
received from the States General and from the States of 
Holland leave of absence for an indefinite time, and declared 
his intention to return and resume the functions of his 
offices whenever circumstances may permit, and testified 
his regret that he had not been able hitherto to serve the 
Republic more effectually. 
</p><p>
The plan of operations at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, the execution of 
which had no doubt been previously concerted so as to avoid 
the appearance of a conquest, commenced on the day of the 
Stadtholder's departure from the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>. 
</p><p>
A Dutch officer appeared with an order from the General 
of the Batavian corps in the French service to the Commander 
of the garrison then in that city, directing him and his garri 
son to lay down their arms, and he exhibited to the Regency 
a commission constituting him Commandant of the place. 
The former garrison consisted altogether of troops who had 
already been made prisoners of war by the French upon the 
frontiers, and had stipulated not to serve against them during 
the war. The Regency, sensible that any further resistance 
to defend their authority could end only in their total destruction, directed the then commander to surrender according to the summons, and received the Batavian from the 
French army as commandant of the city. 
</p><p>
About thirty French hussars were then introduced within 
the walls who took their station before the Stadthouse on the 
morning of the 19th, the three-colored flag was hoisted on 
that building, the tree of liberty was erected before it, and 
an immense crowd of people had collected together about it. 
A revolutionary committee, consisting of ten persons self- 
constituted, or at least whose origin is traced no further, 
appeared in front of the house; one of their members read 
to the people there assembled a list of twenty-one names of 
persons, nominated by the revolutionary committee to 
constitute the Assembly of Provisional Representatives of 
the people of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>. He then demanded of the people, 
whether they approved the nomination, and was answered 
by a general shout of acquiescence. From that moment the 
Provisional Representatives deemed themselves vested with 
the whole power of the sovereign people of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> ; 
and they commenced their functions by sending word to 
the former Regency that the people had no further occasion 
for their services. 
</p><p>
Since that time they have distributed their accumulated 
powers into a variety of committees, for instance, of Public 
Safety, of General Vigilance, of Justice, of Finance, and of 
Trade and Navigation, besides constituting a mayor to super 
intend the police of the city. 
</p><p>
In all the other cities of the province a similar revolution 
was effected in the course of a few days. In all, the ancient 
regencies either did in fact, or by a revolutionary fiction 
were supposed to have surrendered, their authority into 
the hands of the people. A list of new names was always 
ready to be presented for acceptance, in order to substitute 
a provisional authority correspondent to that which was 
annihilated, and where the approbation of the audience was 
not testified by acclamations their silence was taken for 
consent. 
</p><p>
While this operation was going through the admission of 
the French troops was also taking place. The internal 
revolution at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> you will observe was effected on 
the 9th of the month. The next day the General of the 
Army l and the Commissaries of the National Convention 
arrived, and were received as friends. The latter immediately published a proclamation to the Batavian people. 
They declared that they came as friends and allies ; that 
they would respect the persons the property and the opinions 
of every individual ; that the independence of the Batavian 
people should not be violated ; that in the exercise of its 
sovereignty that people alone should reform or modify the 
government, and that all excesses between the inhabitants 
should be prevented. 
</p><p>
In this manner was a total revolution of the sovereignty 
within and the introduction of a foreign army of seventy 
thousand men effected in the province, within the course of 
a week, without blood, without violence, and almost without 
tumult. The crisis of transition lasted but a day, and was 
attended only with noise. Since then the usual tranquility 
has been uninterrupted, everything about us has the same 
appearance that it had before, excepting that instead of 
Orange flags, and cockades, and pictures, are substituted 
French soldiers, the three-colored riband, and the tree of liberty. 
</p><p>
But although the sovereign of the ancient constitution 
was no more, its deputations constituting the States of 
Holland and all their derivatives yet existed. The revolution was hitherto confined to the municipal establishments, 
and it became necessary to extend it to the provincial 
government. The fundamental principle of the new system 
was pursued as closely as could be without great inconvenience. The new municipal regencies in the several 
cities deputed from each of their own bodies three or four 
persons to meet together and administer the government of 
the Province. These deputies from ten or twelve cities 
(for the revolution was not then completed in all,) assembled 
at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, on the 26th of January. They took pos 
sion of the Hall where the States of Holland had always 
held their sessions, having first sent word to the Pensionary 
Van de Spiegel, and to all the former members of the 
equestrian order, that none of them would be admitted to 
their deliberations. They chose Peter Paulus of Rotterdam 
President for a fortnight, assumed the title of the Assembly 
of Provisional Representatives of the People of Holland, 
and made an express acknowledgment of the sovereignty 
of the people, and the rights of men and citizens. They 
also declared that as an immediate consequence from these 
principles, the States of Holland and West Friesland consisting of an equestrian order and voting cities, as also all 
hereditary offices of Stadtholder, Captain and Admiral- 
General, were annulled, and they determined that the votes 
in their Assembly should be personal, and not by cities. 
They abolished also the Gecommitteerde Raad, and divided 
their functions between three Committees of their own 
body. They recalled all the members of the Province in 
the Colleges of the Generality, and appointed three of their 
members to take the seat of the Province in the States 
General, and hold it as long as the present confederation 
shall continue. 
</p><p>
The example of this Province has been imitated in those 
of Utrecht, Guelders and Overyssel. Zeeland has capitulated, and as soon as the passage is opened for the French 
troops the new system will in all probability be adopted there. 
</p><p>
The troops of their friends are quartered upon the inhabit 
ants of the cities. The discipline of the army is rigorous 
and well observed. The only complaint I have heard against 
it is its being too severe. The examples of capital punishment, which have been inflicted in more than one of the 
cities upon soldiers guilty of the most trifling thefts, are 
painful to a people among whom the penalty of death is 
very seldom executed, and reserved for the most enormous crimes. 
</p><p>
The Pensionary Van de Spiegel, the Grand Bailiff of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, Bentinck, the deputy Greffier of the States General, Lelyveldt, two brothers of the Greffier Fagel, and three 
members of the Regency of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=leyden" rel="city">Leyden</a>, are under arrest. All 
the members of the Regencies [are] dismissed and forbidden 
upon the severest penalties to go out of the Province. Some 
of them are held to be responsible for considerable deficiencies in the public Treasuries, and others are supposed to be liable to criminal prosecutions. 
</p><p>
When the revolution shall have pervaded the seven 
Provinces it is expected that a Convention will be chosen 
to form a new Constitution. The sovereignty of the people, 
the equality of individuals, universal suffrage, a single 
Assembly and Committees, will form the basis of the 
future government. 
</p><p>
The communication with foreign countries is suspended, 
and that with France is not yet fully restored. We are 
therefore in a great measure deprived of external intelligence. 
</p><p>
The direct commerce with the United States will I hope 
be soon revived, and receive greater encouragements than 
it has ever yet had. Whatever the motives of the former 
government might be, it is certain that their regulations 
were very unfavorable to the navigation of our country. 
The friendly dispositions of those who have now succeeded 
are the more unequivocal, because they rest upon the foundation of their interest and even of their necessities. 
</p><p>
Among the members of the present administrations are 
many of your former friends. The President of the Provincial Assembly, Mr. Paulus, particularly requested me to 
present you the testimony of his remembrance. Even 
the cautious aversion of Mr. William Willink to public 
employment has been obliged to yield to the exigency of the 
times. He is upon the Committee of Finance at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, 
and reluctantly submitted to the established regulation 
which permits no man to decline the task of public service 
assigned to him. 
</p><p>
The apartments of the Princess of Orange are occupied 
by the Commissaries of the National Convention, who are 
styled the Representatives of the French people. They 
received the visit from the Minister of the United States 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, where he happened to be at the time of their 
arrival. They assured him that they considered it altogether as a fraternal visit, and expressed themselves in 
terms of the utmost civility towards the United States, 
their President and Vice President. They appear to be 
well pleased with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague">Mr. Monroe</a>, but as to his predecessor, 
they spoke of him too, more than once. 
</p><p>
The General in Chief of the Northern Army, Pichegru, 
is lodged in the building called the old Court. In the 
course of three years he has risen from the rank of a sergeant 
of artillery to that in which he now appears, and in which 
he has performed a campaign unparalleled in the history of 
Europe. He avoids as much as possible every appearance 
of public display ; his dispatches to the Convention are 
remarkable for the modest simplicity with which he relates 
the most important successes, and he appears to prefer 
conversing upon any subject rather than that connected 
with his own exploits. 
</p><p>
This disposition may be in some degree the result of a 
natural temper, but it may be partly attributed to a system 
taught by the fatal experience of so many preceding Generals. 
</p><p>
It is impossible to foresee what effect the events herein 
related will produce upon the system of Europe. The King 
of Prussia has a minister at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>. The Imperial Diet has 
determined upon a negotiation for peace. The people of 
England begin to be impatient for the same object. Spain 
is reduced to the last extremity and all Europe is exhausted 
and tired of the desolating war in which it has been so long 
involved. But the perseverance of the British Ministry, 
concurring with the inveteracy of the French nation, will 
produce one campaign more, and it is yet uncertain whether 
this Republic will be permitted to remain in future neutral, 
or whether it is only taken from one side of the scales to be 
thrown into the other. If she ceases to be a belligerent 
power, her present situation will open a very advantageous 
commerce to American enterprise. If she only changes 
sides in the war, an equally promising source of speculation 
will be opened, but will then depend partly upon the justice 
of another maritime power. The treaty signed on the 
19th of November last must before this have been the subject of discussion and of decision in America. Whether ratified or not, many important points and sources of difference will remain undecided. At present it is more than ever 
the interest of the island to avoid a serious misunderstand 
ing with the United States ; they on their part stand upon 
advantageous ground to resent any violation of their neutral 
rights. The present state of affairs will make their reclamations for entire justice compatible with prudence, and if it 
should be denied, the means of increasing their federative 
strength will perhaps be in their hands. 
I am, my Dear Sir, &c.
