YOUR letter from your sick chamber, if not from your 
sick bed, has made me so uneasy, that I must get 
away as soon as possible. Monday morning, at six, I 
am to set off in the stage, but how many days it will 
take to get home will depend on the roads or the 
winds. I don t believe Abby will go with me. Her 
husband is so proud of his wealth that he would not 
let her go&gt; I suppose, without a coach-and-four, and 
such monarchical trumpery I will in future have no 
thing to do with. I will never travel but by the stage, 
nor live at the seat of government but at lodgings, 
while they give me so despicable an allowance. 
Shiver my jib and start my planks if I do.

I will stay but one night at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. Smith 
says that my books are upon the table of every member of the committee for framing a constitution of 
government for France, except Tom Paine, and he is 
so conceited as to disdain to have any thing to do 
with books. Although I abused Smith a little above, 
he is very clever and agreeable : but I have been 
obliged to caution him against his disposition to boast 
ing. Tell not of your prosperity, because it will 
make two men mad to one glad ; nor of your adversity, for it will make two men glad to one sad. He 
boasts too much of having made his fortune, and 
placed himself at his ease, above all favors of government. This is a weakness, and betrays too little knowledge of the world ; too little penetration ; too little discretion. I wish, however, that my boys had a little 
more of his activity. I must soon treat them as the 
pigeons treat their squabs push them off the limb, 
and make them put out their wings or fall. Young 
pigeons will never fly till this is done. Smith has acquired the confidence of the French ministry and the 
better sort of the members of the national convention ; but the executive is too changeable in that 
country to be depended on, without the utmost caution.
