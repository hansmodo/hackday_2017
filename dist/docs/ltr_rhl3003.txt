DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The inclosed letter, from Colonel Pendleton, came to hand two days ago, and, as it will save a good deal of unnecessary writing, I send it to yon. 
</p><p>
The proclamation, there alluded to, we have seen. 
It proclaims martial law through Virginia, and orders freedom to all the slaves, calling their masters rebels, &c. It seems this unlucky triumph over Hutchings, 
with his less than half-armed militia, so dispirited the 
miserable wretches in that neighbourhood, that many 
have taken an oath of Lord Dunmore's prescribing. 
</p><p>
reprobating Congress, Committees, &c. Long before 
this, Colonel Woodford, with eight hundred good men, 
must be arrived in those parts ; and I make no doubt 
has forced his Lordship on board his ships again. 
All this would have been prevented, if our troops 
could have crossed James River, in proper time ; but 
they were obstructed, and forced to march high up, 
by the men-of-war; and indeed, such is the nature 
of our water-intersected country, that a small number 
of men, provided with naval force, can harass us extremely. 
</p><p>
I have good reason to hope, that in a few weeks 
the state of things in Virginia will be greatly altered 
for the better. I thank you for your list of armed 
vessels, but at present no use can be made of them. 
I hope some of them will be fortunate enough to 
meet with prizes eastward. 
</p><p>
I had not heard of your improvements on the 
Kanawha being destroyed, and unless Mr. Lund Washington has received very accurate information on 
this head, I am inclined to doubt it; because I see, 
in the treaty lately concluded with all the Ohio Indians, they first inform the Commissioners of the 
Kanawha fort being burnt by some of their rash 
young men ; but they promise to punish the offenders, 
and prevent repetition of the like offence. They are 
very precise in their information, and mention only 
the fort, as well as I remember. I hope, therefore, 
that your property may yet be safe. This treaty 
with the Indians is more likely to last, as Connolly, 
with his little corps of officers, is now in close custody in Maryland, having been arrested there, as they 
were stealing through the country to Pittsburg, from whence they were to proceed to Detroit, and with the troops in those western parts, Indians, &c. ? he was 
to have done wonders. This wonderful man is now in close jail.
</p><p>
I congratulate you on the surrender of Montreal ; 
and from <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague'>General Montgomery's</a> letter, giving an account of that event, I think we have room to expect 
that Quebec is fallen before now. A Committee of 
Congress, some time since sent to Canada, have direction to raise a regiment in that country, to invite 
delegates to this Congress, and give the strongest 
assurances of protection to their civil and religions 
rights. I am glad to hear of your getting Cobble Hill, and I hope it will prove useful to you. We 
are told that your enemy's troops are very uneasy 
on Bunker's Hill. God grant that their uneasiness 
may increase to their ruin. No accounts yet from 
England, but ships are daily expected. I am, with 
much esteem, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
