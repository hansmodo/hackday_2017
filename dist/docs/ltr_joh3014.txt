The Congress, for some time past, have had their 
attention occupied by one of the most interesting and 
important subjects, that could possibly come before 
them or any other assembly of men. 
</p><p>
Although it is not possible to foresee the consequences of human actions, yet it is, nevertheless, a 
duty we owe ourselves and posterity, in all our pub 
lic councils, to decide in the best manner we are 
able, and to leave the event to that Being who controls both causes and events, to bring about his own determinations. 
</p><p>
Impressed with this sentiment, and at the same time 
fully convinced that our affairs may take a more favorable turn, the Congress have judged it necessary 
to dissolve the connection between Great Britain and 
the American Colonies, and to declare them free and 
independent States, as you will perceive by the in 
closed DECLARATION, which I am directed by Congress 
to transmit to you, and to request you will have it 
proclaimed at the head of the army in the way you 
shall think most proper.
</p><p>
Agreeably to the request of Congress, the Committee of Safety of this Colony have forwarded to you 
ten thousand flints, and the Hints at Rhode Island are ordered to be sent to you immediately. 
</p><p>
It is with great pleasure I inform you, that the militia of this Colony, of Delaware Government, and 
Maryland, are, and will be every day in motion, to form the Flying Camp, and that all the militia of 
this Colony will soon be in the Jerseys, ready to receive such orders as you shall please to give them. 
</p><p>
I have written to <a href='/results.php?tla=nic' rel='colleague'>Governor Cooke</a>, to engage immediately, and send forward as fast as possible, fifty 
ship-carpenters to <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, for the purpose of building vessels on the Lakes. Fifty have already gone from hence on that business. 
</p><p>
The Congress having directed the arms, taken on board the Scotch transports, to be sent to you. I have 
written to the agents in Rhode Island and Massachusetts Bay, to forward them immediately. 
</p><p>
The inclosed copy of a letter from Mr. Green, I am directed to forward, by Congress, with a request that you will order such parts of the stores, therein 
mentioned, to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as you shall judge proper. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, Sir, with perfect esteem, your most obedient and very humble servant,
