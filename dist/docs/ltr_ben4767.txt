JUST come home from a Venison Feast, where I have drank more than a Philosopher ought, I find my dear Polly's chearful, chatty Letter, that exhilirates me more than all the Wine. 
</p><p>
Your good Mother says there is no Occasion for any Intercession of mine in your behalf. She is sensible that she is 
more in fault than her Daughter. She received an affectionate, tender Letter from you, and she has not answered it, 
tho' she intended to do it; but her Head, not her Heart, 
has been bad, and unfitted her for Writing. She owns, that 
she is not so good a Subject as you are, and that she is more 
unwilling to pay Tribute to Cesar, and has less Objection 
to Smuggling; but 'tis not, she says, mere Selfishness or 
Avarice ; 'tis rather an honest Resentment at the Waste of 
those Taxes in Pensions, Salaries, Perquisites, Contracts, 
and other Emoluments for the Benefit of People she does 
not love, and who do not deserve such Advantages, because I suppose because they are not of her Party. 
</p><p>
Present my Respects to your good Landlord and his Family. 
I honour them for their conscientious Aversion to illicit 
Trading. There are those in the World, who would not 
wrong a Neighbour, but make no Scruple of cheating the 
King. The Reverse, however, does not hold; for whoever 
scruples cheating the King, will certainly not wrong his 
Neighbour.

You ought not to wish yourself an Enthusiast. They 
have, indeed, their imaginary Satisfactions and Pleasures, 
but these are often ballanc'd by imaginary Pains and Mortifications. You can continue to be a good Girl, and thereby 
lay a solid Foundation for expected future Happiness, without 
the Enthusiasm that may perhaps be necessary to some others. 
As those Beings, who have a good sensible Instinct, have no 
need of Reason, so those, who have Reason to regulate their 
Actions, have no Occasion for Enthusiasm. However, there 
are certain Circumstances in Life, sometimes, wherein 'tis 
perhaps best not to hearken to Reason. For instance; possibly, if the Truth were known, I have Reason to be jealous 
of this same insinuating, handsome young Physician; but, 
as it flatters more my Vanity, and therefore gives me more 
Pleasure, to suppose you were in Spirits on ace' of my safe 
Return, I shall turn a deaf Ear to Reason in this Case, as 
I have done with Success in twenty others. But I am sure 
you will always give me Reason enough to continue ever your 
</p><p>
affectionate Friend, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. Our Love to Mrs. Tickell. We all long for your 
Return. Your Dolly was well last Tuesday; the Girls 
were there on a Visit to her; I mean at Bromley. Adieu. 
No time now to give you any ace of my French Journey.
