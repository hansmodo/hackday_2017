General Benton called and read me a letter which he had addressed to the people of Oregon, stating to them that the agitation of the slavery question had caused the rejection of the bill to organize a territorial government over them at the last session of Congress. I disapproved the letter, but knowing his domineering disposition and utter impatience of contradiction or difference of opinion, and knowing that I could not change his Opinions, I contented myself with simply stating very briefly my objections to the letter and expressing my doubts of sending such a letter. I feared it might deceive the people of Oregon, as to the real state of public opinion in the States in regard to them, and might incline them to set up an independent government of their own. General Benton then asked me to appoint his son-in-law, Mr. Jones, who married his daughter a few days ago, a chargé d'affaires abroad. I told him there was no vacancy, and gave him no encouragement. I told him that there was a place of the kind which might be vacant soon, but that there were some commitments in regard to it; and added that I did not see that it would be in my power to gratify his wishes. He said he merely wished to present the application, and leave the disposition of it  with me. Mr. Jones had made a similar application in person a few days ago (the day before he was married) and I gave him the same answer. I note this case, out of the thousands of applications which are made to me for office, because I predict if I do not appoint Mr. Jones that it will be the cause of a violent outbreak of opposition to me by General Benton. Mr. Jones has no claims upon me for this or any other office. He was but a short time ago the editor of a Federal paper in New Orleans.
