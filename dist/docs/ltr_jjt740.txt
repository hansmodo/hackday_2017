Dear Sister
</p><p>
Finally I have arrived at this station which is in sight of the city of New York. I have had some hopes of visiting you this fall but I have not been able to arrange my affairs here for that purpose and consequently I can not say when I will be able to visit those of whom I so frequently think and so much desire to be with. I presume that I could get home this winter by making sacrifices which I ought not to make, for instance if I should leave some other officer might be attached during my absence who would rank me in case of his remaining with the company after my return. I do not believe that Capt. Taylor would give his sanction to any officers coming to the company who would rank me, so long as I remain with the company or so long as there are officers enough with it, but my absence might reduce the number of officers so much as to render another officer necessary to the company.

But I am in hopes that next summer I shall be able to see you and if so I purpose on visiting the springs at several places and visiting those parts of Virginia most remarkable such as the Natural Bridge. You will please let me know the distance from Beverly to Staunton, & the time in which the stage [visits] it, and also the distance from Beverly to the White Sulphur Springs.

As yet I do not know where I will be stationed. I hope that ere this your eyes are perfectly recovered. I am still getting better. I have been brevetted a captain though as yet it is not published. Write frequently to your brother.
