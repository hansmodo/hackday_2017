Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to write to you on the twenty-ninth of April 
last. I shall not trouble you with a recital of events, which Mr Jefferson has, I know, communicated to the office of foreign 
affairs. But being now here on my way to London, and finding a vessel bound directly to New York, I take the opportunity 
to send some tables, which contain the political, military, pecuniary, and commercial state of this country. I believe them 
to be tolerably authentic as far as they go. 
</p><p>
I will also communicate a matter, which Mr Jefferson was 
not yet informed of, and which I could not tell him, because 
I was forbidden to mention it to any person here. You know, 
I dare say, that the Count de Moustiers has his conge. His 
successor will be Colonel Ternant. At first, in the character 
of Charge des Affaires, and when M. de Moustiers is otherwise 
placed, it is highly probable that Ternant may be made Minister ; but that will depend on the situation of the court at the 
time, so that there I only state probability. As to the other, 
you may rely on it, because my intelligence I know to be good. 
The important trait in this appointment is, that he is named as 
a person who will be agreeable to us. 
</p><p>
You may rely, also, on what I am about to mention, but 
which I pray you not to disclose. It is known to very few in 
this country, and may, perhaps, as it ought, be buried in oblivion. The King has actually formed the design of going off 
to Spain. Whether the measures set on foot to dissuade him 
will have, as I hope, the desired effect, time only can discover. His fears govern him absolutely, and they have of late 
been most strongly excited. He is a well meaning man, but extremely weak, and probably these circumstances will in every 
event secure him from personal injury. An able man would 
not have fallen into his situation, but I think that no ability 
can now extricate him. He must float along the current of 
events, being absolutely and entirely a cypher. If, however, 
he should fly, it would not be easy to predict the consequences, 
for this country is at present as near to anarchy as society can 
approach without dissolution. There are some able men in 
the National Assembly, yet the best heads among them would 
not be injured by experience, and unfortunately there are great 
numbers who, with much imagination, have little knowledge, 
judgment, or reflection. You may consider the revolution as 
complete, that is to say, the authority of the King and of the 
nobility is completely subdued ; yet I tremble for the constitution. They have all that romantic spirit, and all those 
romantic ideas of government, which happily for America we 
were cured of before it was too late. They are advancing 
rapidly. But I must check myself, or my reflections will occupy too much space both for you and for me.

One of the last persons I saw in Paris was M. de Lafayette. 
He had promised to trust me with a letter for you, but he must 
be excused, for he is as busy as a man can be. Not long 
since, speaking to him on his own subject, I told him some 
hints I had given, tending to make him governor of the Isle of 
France, which you know includes Paris. He declared that 
the command of the military in that city only was the utmost of 
his wishes. That he was satiated with power. He had his sovereign, during the late procession to Paris, completely within his 
authority. He had marched him where he pleased, measured 
out the degree of applause he should receive as he pleased, 
and if he pleased could have detained him prisoner. All this is 
strictly true. He commanded on that day at least eighty thou 
sand men, who, during the King's progress through them to the 
Hotel de Ville, shouted Vive la Nation, and only on his return cried Vive la Roi. 
</p><p>
I do not know whether you will be informed of the critical 
situation in which things were placed, just before the last ministry were turned out and the old one restored. My authority 
is very good, but yet I will not vouch for the truth. It was re 
solved to reduce Paris by famine, to take two hundred of the 
States-General prisoners, to dissolve that assembly, and to govern in the old-fashioned way. All this you will say was madness, and therefore improbable. But was it not equally mad 
to drive away Necker, and change the ministry at the time and 
in the manner, which were chosen for that purpose ? The men, 
weak enough for the one, were certainly mad enough for the 
other. Two German regiments, which were to be employed, 
were regaled by the Queen in the Orangerie at Versailles. 
They received promises and largesses, and were prevailed on to 
shout Vive la Reine, Vive le Comte d Jlrtois, Vive la Duchesse 
de Polignac. Afterwards their music played for hours under 
her Majesty's window. The Mareschal de Broglio endeavored, 
at the same time, to conciliate the artillery. But it was at 
length discovered, that, though the troops would shout and sing, 
yet they would not fight against their countrymen. All which 
might have been known long ago. At the moment when their 
intrigue was carrying on by the court, the Gardes du Corps 
and Gardes Fran^aises combined to defend the members of the 
National Assembly. I pass over those facts, which you cannot 
but know, to mention in one word, that the whole army of 
France have declared for liberty ; and that one reason why his 
Majesty has not taken the steps above mentioned, is, that he 
does not know a single regiment that would obey him. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear Sir. I write this letter in much hurry, and 
after much fatigue. Excuse in it everything inaccurate or 
inelegant, and pardon it, on the score of that sincere and affectionate respect, with which I am, &tc.
