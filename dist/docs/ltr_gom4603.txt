Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
1 had the honor to write to you on the fourth of last month. 
Two days after, I was informed that you had nominated me as 
minister to the court of France, but the latest advices from 
America, which come down to the tenth of January, show that 
the Senate had not then made their decision. Be that decision what it may, I shall ever gratefully esteem and acknowledge 
this mark of confidence from the person in the world, whose 
good opinion I consider most estimable. 
</p><p>
In my letter of the fourth, I gave you a picture of the French 
ministry, and a view of the measures pursued by different par 
ties, including the mission of the Bishop d Autun. As he has 
now got back to Paris, it may be well to communicate the result. His reception was bad, for three reasons. First, that 
the court looks with horror and apprehension at the scenes acting in France, of which they consider him as a prime mover. 
Secondly, that his reputation is offensive to persons, who pique 
themselves on decency of manners and deportment. And lastly, because he was so imprudent, when he first arrived, as to 
propagate the idea that he should corrupt the members of ad 
ministration, and afterwards by keeping company with leading 
characters among the dissenters, and other similar circumstances, he renewed the impression made before his departure 
from Paris, that he meant to intrigue with the discontented. 
His public reception, however, furnishes no clue to decide on 
the success of his mission; because the former might have been 
very bad, and the latter very good. 
</p><p>
The fact however is, that he could offer nothing worthy of 
their acceptance, and that what he asked was of a nature not 
to be granted. His offer was confined to the cession of Tobago, a demolition of the works of Cherburg, and an extension of 
the commercial treaty. He asked a strict neutrality in case of 
war with the Emperor. Now you will observe, that no court 
could prudently treat with France in her present situation, seeing that nobody can promise in her name otherwise than as god 
fathers and godmothers do at a christening ; and how such 
promises are kept everybody knows. Convinced of this, the 
Bishop never told his errand to Lord Gower, the British Ambassador at Paris, who mentioned that circumstance to me as 
extraordinary, but yet so far agreeable, as that he was glad 
not to have been called on for letters of introduction. 
</p><p>
Respecting Tobago I must make a digression. It is now a 
long time since it was mentioned to me in Paris, that some of 
the colonists of St Domingo had come hither to make overtures 
to Mr Pitt. Since that period, I learnt that the French minis 
try were in possession of documents to prove, not only that he 
fomented the disturbances in France, but that he was in deep 
intrigues with regard to that colony. The particular proofs 
were not shown to me, so that I cannot speak positively. 
Neither can I vouch for what T have learnt further on that subject within this month ; but I am assured, that it is Mr Pitt's 
intention to bring about, if he can, the independence of St Domingo. Mr Clarkson, the great negro advocate, is mentioned 
to me as his agent for this business at Paris, and the conduct 
of a part of the Assembly, in opposing succor to that island, 
seems corroborative of such an idea. This then being the case, 
or supposing it to be so, the offer of Tobago was too trifling to 
attract Mr Pitt's notice, even if unconnected with other circumstances. By the bye, my informant tells me also, that Mr Pitt 
means to coax us into the adoption of his plan respecting St 
Domingo. And I learn from another quarter, that he means 
to offer us his mediation for a peace with the Indians. If all 
this be true, his game is evident. The mediation is to be with iis a price for adopting his plans, and with the Indian tribes a 
means of constituting himself their patron and protector. It 
may be proper to combine all this with the late division of Can 
ada, and the present measures for military colonization of the 
upper country, and above all with what may come from Mr Hammond. 
</p><p>
I return to St Domingo. If such be Mr Pitt's scheme, 
although we shall not, I presume, engage in, or countenance 
it, yet the success will be entirely for our advantage, and a 
mere preliminary to something of the same sort, which must 
happen to Jamaica on the first change of wind in the political 
world. The destruction of the port of Cherburg is no present object with the British ministry, because they suppose it 
will be ruined by the elements before it can be completed ; 
and because the French Marine is, from the want of discipline, 
an object more of contempt than apprehension. The proffered extension of the commercial treaty amounts to nothing, be 
cause at present every part of France is open to contraband 
commerce, and because there is little reason to believe, that 
the stipulations in a treaty now made would be of any long 
duration. 
</p><p>
Thus it happens that neither of the objects offered were 
worthy of notice. But the neutrality required was of a most 
important nature. By leaving the Austrian Low Countries 
exposed to French invasion, it would have been a violation 
both of ancient and of recent treaties. Nor is this all, for (as 
I have already had occasion to remark) the annexation of those 
provinces to the French monarchy would prove almost, if not 
altogether, fatal to Great Britain. And when we consider 
that they are almost in revolt already, and that it is in fact their 
interest to become one with France, there is reason to 
suppose that a union might have been effected, in case of a 
war with the Emperor. 
</p><p>
So much then on the ground of good faith, and good policy. 
But there is still a farther cause, which, as the world goes, 
may be equal in its operation to all others. It seems to be a 
moot point whether it is the British or the Prussian cabinet 
which directs the other. Perhaps there may be a little of 
both ; but be all that as it may, it is certain that neither feels 
disposed to counteract the views of its ally, in any open 
manner. Now putting aside the personal feelings, which naturally agitate the sovereign of this, as well as of other kingdoms, in 
regard to the French revolution ; it is notorious that from the 
very dawn of it, agents were employed to foment a spirit of re 
volt in other States, particularly in Prussia. The king of Prussia therefore feels for the French revolutionists all the enmity 
of a proud, passionate, and offended German Prince. Add to 
this, that the Elector of Hanover, as such, cannot wish for a 
change in the government of Germany. If therefore it had 
been the interest of Great Britain to establish a free constitutlon in France, (which it certainly is not,) I am perfectly convinced that this court would never have made a single effort 
for the purpose. 
</p><p>
I stated to you, in my last, that the French ministry are 
extremely disjointed. It was too much so for any durable 
existence, besides which, the members took effectual means 
to precipitate each other's ruin. M. de Narbonne wished to 
get into the office of Foreign Affairs. This was desirable to 
him, it is said, on many accounts, but particularly so because 
it gives the command of large sums without account. What 
ever may have been his motives, the following seems to have 
been his conduct. He stood forth the advocate of all violent 
measures. This would naturally have excited suspicions with 
thinking men, but not so with the Assembly. He associated 
himself to the partizans of democracy, and while by these means 
he secured himself against their clamors, he took great care 
of his pecuniary affairs. This at least is affirmed to me, and 
with the addition that he had the imprudence to pay off his 
debts, although it is notorious that his estate, (which is in St 
Domingo,) is among those which are laid waste. It is further 
asserted, that in order to quiet the clamors of contractors who 
had given him money, and found themselves in the road to 
ruin, he agreed to compensate the depreciation of the Assignats. In order to remove a great obstacle to his proceedings, 
he joined in the intrigues against M. Bertrand, and at the 
same time fostered other intrigues against M. Delessart, with 
a view of getting his place. The proofs of all these things 
are said to be in the King's hands. 
</p><p>
M. Delessart's conduct I have already in part communicated. I must add that, afterwards, imagining that Brissot de Warville and Condorcet were omnipotent in the Assembly, he 
violated his engagements made with the Triumvirate, and wrote some despatches conformably to the views of those two gentle 
men. In consequence of this, it was resolved to displace him, and they were looking out for a successor. The person 
applied to was actually deliberating whether he should or should not accept, at the moment when Brissot brought about his impeachment and arrest. Tn this same moment M. de Narbonne 
was dismissed, and with him was to go M. de Gerville. The 
Chevalier de Graave succeeds M. de Narbonne. When I 
left Paris he was attached to the Triumvirate. He does not 
want understanding, but I think it almost impossible that he 
should succeed. Monsieur Bertrand, against whom an address 
from the Assembly was at length carried, has, I find, resigned. 
There is something at the bottom, which I cannot discover, 
without being on the spot, but you may rely on it he goes out 
with the full confidence of the King and Queen. 
</p><p>
My informations from Paris are previous to the news of the 
Emperor's death, which has probably occasioned the violent 
proceedings against poor DelesSart, by removing the fears of 
those who, in the midst of all their big words, were confoundedly frightened. What may be the consequences of this event 
it is impossible to determine, or even to conjecture. Much, 
very much, depends on the personal character of his successor, 
which I am not yet acquainted with. 
</p><p>
It is supposed by some here, that Mr Pitt is not strong in 
the cabinet at present, although the majority in Parliament was 
never more decisive, and this is said to arise from his refusing 
to ask money for the payment of the Prince of Wales's debts, 
which the King, it is said, was desirous of, and which his minister declined, with some offensive expressions. Mr Pitt's 
friends insist, on the other hand, that the whole story is false, 
from beginning to end. For my own part, I do not think he 
will be turned out, because I believe him to be very cunning, 
and although he has conducted Foreign Affairs but poorly, he 
manages all the little court and parliamentary intrigues with 
consummate address.
