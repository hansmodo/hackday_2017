DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
On the 12th instant <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a> arrived here. 
As he fell in with Hudson's River about twelve 
miles below this, I ordered the troops to halt at Fort 
Miller, having no kind of shelter for them at any 
other place, and not even a sufficiency of boards at 
that. What the number is that have arrived I have 
not yet been able to learn, as the greatest confusion 
imaginable prevails here. <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a> supposes 
about fifteen hundred. Nor can I say what militia 
are in this quarter. I do not, however, suppose that 
our whole strength, in this department, exceeds four 
thousand five hundred men. 
</p><p>
Colonel Warner, with the remains of his regiment, 
I have ordered to remain on what are commonly 
called the New Hampshire Grants, together with the 
militia from that part of this State. He has direction. to drive off all the cattle and carriages; but 
whether he will be able to effect it is a doubt, as I 
am informed a very great proportion of the inhabit 
ants are taking protections from <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'><a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a></a>, as 
most of those in this quarter are also willing to do. 
</p><p>
Two regiments of the militia from, the State of the 
Massachusetts, under the command of Learned and 
Wells, who were sent up to supply, in part, the deficiencies of the other regiments from that State, are, 
to a man, gone home. 
</p><p>
General Nixon arrived the night before last, with 
his brigade. From the slowness with which they 
moved from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> to this, being four days marching  forty-six miles, I was led to conclude that they were a formidable body; but to my great mortification, I find the whole to consist of five hundred 
and seventy-five, rank and file, fit for duty, and eleven sick. Several of these are negroes, and many 
of them young, small, and feeble boys. Desertion 
prevails, and disease gains ground ; nor is it to be 
wondered at, for we have neither tents, houses, barns, 
boards, or any shelter, except a little brush. Every 
rain that falls, and we have it in great abundance 
almost every day, wets the men to the skin. We 
are, besides, in great want of every kind of necessaries, provisions excepted. Camp-kettles we have so 
few, that we cannot afford above one to twenty men. 
Although we have near fifteen tons of powder, yet 
we have so little lead, that I could not give each 
man above fifteen rounds; and although I have saved 
about thirty pieces of light artillery, yet I have not 
a single carriage for them, so that my whole train 
of artillery consists of two iron field-pieces, which General Nixon brought up with his brigade. 
</p><p>
I have, indeed, written to Springfield for the can 
non which were there ; but the answer I got was, that 
they were all ordered another way. I have also 
written for a variety of articles to that place and to 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ; not that I expect any thing will be sent me, 
but that I may stand justified, for I have never yet 
been able to get much of any thing from thence. 
In this situation I have only to look up to your Excellency for relief ; and permit me to entreat you to 
send a reenforcement of troops, and such a supply 
of artillery, ammunition, and every other necessary, 
except provisions and powder, as an army ought to 
have, if it can possibly be spared. 
</p><p>
An express has passed through the country from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'><a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a></a> to General Howe. The latter will, probably, on receipt thereof, immediately move up Hudson's River. 
</p><p>
I inclose your Excellency copy of the proceedings 
of a Council of General Officers, held at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, 
a copy of which I beg you will transmit to congress, and be so good as to mention that I have not 
time to do myself the honor to write them. It contains the principles on which the evacuation of that 
fortress took place. 
</p><p>
If the enemy will permit us to pass unmolested, 
three days longer, to Fort George, I shall be able to 
bring away all the stores from thence, and then draw 
off the few troops we have there. 
</p><p>
Yesterday, accompanied by the General Officers and 
engineers, I examined the country, and found a very 
defensible spot about four miles below this, to which 
place we are this day moving part of the army, and 
our stores. I propose remaining here until Fort 
George is abandoned, and as much longer as the 
enemy will permit me. 
</p><p>
General Nixon, with his brigade, supported by 
about six hundred militia, is advanced to Fort Ann, 
to fell trees into Wood Creek, and into the road 
from Fort Ann to this place. I have also stationed 
a body of militia about five miles on this side of 
Fort George, to cover the retreat of the garrison 
now at that place. 
</p><p>
We are informed that part of the enemy are still 
at Skenesborough, and that a body is coming by the 
way of Lake George. I hope it will not be very 
soon. Adieu, my dear Sir; and believe me, unfeignedly, and with great respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
