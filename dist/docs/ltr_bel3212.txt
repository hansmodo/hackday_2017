GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
From a representation of the officers, and from my own observation, I find the men sent here from the county of <a href='/results.php?city=worcester' rel='city'>Worcester</a>, 
under the command of Colonel Gushing, left their homes in such 
haste, that they are by no means prepared to remain in camp 
any considerable time, and many of them had no opportunity to 
make that provision for their families left behind, which they 
would have done had they considered they were to have been 
long detained. <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a> hath repeatedly, in the most 
pressing terms, urged that all the troops in the Grants, excepting 
one small regiment, should join him. Colonel Cushing's regiment, 
excepting some who have deserted, are this day to march for 
Stillwater, which most of them cheerfully undertake, notwithstanding their peculiar situation. I hope that, as early as men can be 
raised for a time limited, these will be discharged. This, as they 
come out upon an alarm, they do expect, and I am sure it will 
give quiet, and I think, on the whole, much promote the general 
interest. 
</p><p>
The enemy have left the Grants. They collected their whole 
force at <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a>, and are moving down, and seem deter 
mined to possess themselves of <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. I hope they will meet 
with a check before they reach it; I presume they will, if the 
militia expected arrive in time. There never was an opportunity 
when we could act with so great a probability of success against 
them as the present, for they have penetrated, and are penetrating far into the country, and have left a very naked and uncovered rear ; therefore, never a greater call for the exertions of 
the people. 
</p><p>
I am very sorry that I am obliged to inform your Honors, that, 
notwithstanding the evident pressing necessity for men at Stillwater to support our brethren there, a number of Colonel Cushing's regiment left it, on finding the enemy had quitted the 
Grants, and have returned or are returning home, contrary to 
the orders and advice of their officers. 
</p><p>
They pretend to say, in their own justification, that they came 
out on an alarm, for a particular purpose, namely, to oppose the 
enemy on the Grants ; and that, as Burgoyne has withdrawn his 
troops from that quarter, they are no longer held. Would it not 
be best, whenever they are ordered out, to limit the time of their 
service, and prevent, if possible, their entertaining an idea that 
they are bound to act in any one of the United States rather 
than another? 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
