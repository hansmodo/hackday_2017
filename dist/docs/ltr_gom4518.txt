Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The British employ themselves about the evacuation of New York, but that business goes on slowly. I am however 
informed from tolerable authority, that they will be gone by the 
beginning of November. If, as you suppose, the British Ministry imagine that we cannot retaliate their restrictions, they 
are deceived, for their conduct will itself give Congress a power, which they might not otherwise be possessed of. Indeed, 
my friend, nothing can do us so much good, as to convince the 
Eastern and Southern States how necessary it is to give proper force to the federal government, and nothing will so soon 
operate that conviction as foreign efforts to restrain the navigation of the one, and the commerce of the other. 
</p><p>
But for my own part, I have no desire to retaliate commercial restrictions. It is my fixed opinion, that a nation can by 
such restrictions do nothing more than injure herself, nor is an 
injury the less so because it affects mope the remote members, 
than it does the head of an empire. The sovereign may collect and ought to have revenue from all his dominions, which 
are in condition to afford it, but he acts weakly, as well as 
wickedly , if he cramps one part of the community, that he may 
draw more easily the blood and juices from another part. 
The late prohibition to trade with the British Islands, unless in 
British bottoms, can do us no harm, and can do them no 
good. Our produce they must and will have, and if they 
employ half a million in carrying on the navigation at a great 
expense, which we should have performed at a less expense 
for two hundred thousand, our two hundred thousand will be 
left for other operations, even to speculate on their produce 
and our own, so as to make them pay the speculator a profit on every gallon of rum they sell, and every barrel of flour they 
buy in our ports. By making the subsistence of their people 
in the Islands more expensive, they aid the efforts of rival nations to furnish the commodities of their Islands to others, and 
even to their own subjects. This kind of policy is so bad, that 
I am persuaded the British Ministers cannot seriously intend 
the prohibition, although I am equally convinced, that a regard 
to the national prejudices renders it unavoidable at present. 
I do not, therefore, think we should labor to undo what is 
done, but leave things a while to their own course. And as to 
a treaty of commerce, I think the best way is to make no 
treaty for some time to come, and if we tell them that we 
will make no treaty, they will be much more desirous of it than we ought to be.

<a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met'>Mr Adams</a> seems to be in opinion with you, as to the necessity of sending a Minister to England, as indeed he does on 
some other points. He will, I suppose, be the man, for sundry 
reasons, which I might assign, but he will have serious cause 
to repent of the appointment under present circumstances. 
Nothing would have more unfavorable effects, than to send a 
Minister, who should feel himself attached or opposed to any of 
the parties, by which that nation is rent asunder. We should 
hold them in equal indifference of sentiment, with equal appearance of confidence, paying to the Ins a respect due to 
their places, but which neither Ins or Outs are, or can be, entitled to on the score of their merit and virtue, at least from us. 
As we may not easily find a man capable of this conduct, perhaps the best Minister is no Minister, for the want of one will 
show, that we are not precipitate in a desire of close connexion, and that, however the old mercantile habits may have revived commercial intercourse, the government has a proper 
jealousy and caution. This circumstance, also, must work favorably on our politics with other powers, and give weight 
and dignity lo the Ministers we do send. I am, &.c.
