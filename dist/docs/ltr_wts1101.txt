My Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
This is the most extraordinary place on earth. Large 
brick and granite houses fill the site where stood the 
poor, contemptible village ; wharves extend a mile out, 
along which lie ships and steamers of the largest class, 
discharging freight in a day that used to consume with 
scows a month. Yet amid all this business and bustle 
there is more poverty than in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. Not a day 
without distressed individuals ask for money. 
</p><p>
My business here is the best going, provided we have 
plenty of money. Without it, I stick to Uncle Sam, 
most emphatically. 
</p><p>
Your brother, 
</p><p>
