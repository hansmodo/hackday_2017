<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>, June 4, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1805">1805</a>. 
MY DEAREST <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="sibling met">Anna</a>, I write to you 
from my bed, to which I have been confined for ten days with a bad knee ; it has 
become very painful, and two doctors have applied caustic with the hope of getting 
me well, but Heaven only knows ! I feel as if I should never walk again. My dear 
husband insists upon taking me to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> to be under Dr. Physic s care, but 
he cannot stay with me, and I dread the separation. 
</p><p>
Yesterday we had brother George, Thornton, and Lawrence <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a> to 
spend the day, and I enjoyed the sound of Virginia hilarity echoing through the 
house ; George coughs incessantly, looks thin and hoarse, but has no idea of dying. 
Since I wrote you two days past, I have heard sad things of Tourreau, that he 
whips his wife, and abuses her dreadfully ; I pity her sincerely ; she is an amiable, 
sensible woman. A letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a> begging me to come there, but 
alas ! I shall walk no more. 
</p><p>
Yours ever, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=dol" rel="me">DOLLY </a>.
