<p>Executive Mansion,
Washington, April 30, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1864">1864</a>.
</p>
Lieutenant-General Grant,--
<p>
Not expecting to see you again before the spring campaign opens, I
wish to express, in this way, my entire satisfaction with what you
have done up to this time, so far as I understand it. The
particulars of your plans I neither know, or seek to know. You are
vigilant and self reliant; and, pleased with this, I wish not to
obtrude any constraints or restraints upon you. While I am very
anxious that any great disaster, or the capture of our men in great
numbers, shall be avoided, I know these points are less likely to
escape your attention than they would be mine. If there is anything
wanting which is within my power to give, do not fail to let me
know it.
</p><p>
And now with a brave Army, and a just cause, may God sustain you.
</p><p>
Yours very truly,
</p>
A. LINCOLN.
