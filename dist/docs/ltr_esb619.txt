 My Darling Hubbie:
</p><p>
Allow me to suggest that correspondence by telegraph is both public and expensive.
</p><p>
I feel as though that there must have been some terrible earthquake in your mind or at least a severe shock of some kind to produce two such peremptory telegrams as we have been in receipt of. Did you think that terrible and unknown dangers threatened to engulf me in that homeopathic hospital or that I should be suddenly cut off by cholera?
</p><p>
I was really confounded on reaching home last night to find a telegram from you awaiting me (I had left before the arrival of Lucy's word in Cleveland) and still again astonished by a fresh telegram today notwithstanding Lucy's telegram to you that she would send for me.
</p><p>
I am strongly inclined to be vexed but will try to suspend judgment until I receive your explanation.
</p><p>
I feel in better courage in regard to my own health than have done for your courage that I may recover real strength such as I need to have - If I have had ulceration all these years as I cannot doubt from the lecturing of this skillful physician like Dr. Sanders and Dr. Fitch of Maine. I think that it is quite wonderful that I have preserved as much strength as I have.
</p><p>
I think that the strength of constitution that has enabled me to bear its draining effects so long will if it is cured, give me my old strength and health again.
</p><p>
I brought from Cleveland medicine with directions how to care for myself by aid of which the Dr. thinks I may be able to recover without further treatment from a physician. If I could have had a skillful medical assistance soon after I was married I fully believe that I might have escaped all these years of increasing disability. If I am well when you go to East next Christmas I shall be a proud little wife. Baby has been slightly ill with diarrhea but I do not think it will prove serious. I bought some medicine from Dr. Sanders for complaints anticipating that she might have an attack because there is just now a great deal of that disease among children - should have been quite anxious about her if I had had her in Cleveland with me, there was a great deal of cholera infection among children there.
</p><p>
If she is well and my money reaches here in season I design to leave here on the 9th, which will be Saturday remain with my cousin at Swanton until Sunday and reach Chicago on Sunday night.
</p><p>
If sister meets me there and my friends hold out [...] to remain in Chicago until Wed. night in order to look about among the artists. Mr. Irving is waiting for my letter and I must close hastily.
</p><p>
Did you receive a letter from me urging you to get nasal douche like one which I have.
</p><p>
With loving kisses:
