Dear Brother : I am at length at home with sufficient 
leisure to think, but still somewhat jaded from a very 
laborious session. When I went into the Senate I anticipated quiet and dignified leisure with ample time to 
read, reflect and study such grave questions of politics as 
I chose to turn my attention to. Such thus far has not 
been my experience. The vast and complicated legislature required by war, demands of Senators an amount 
of labor in committees never before given. The Senate 
has become a laborious committee where bills are drawn 
as well as discussed. It has so happened that although 
a junior yet I have had to carry the most important 
financial bills, such as the Bank Loan and Tax Bills, 
subjects full of difficulty and detail. . . . 
</p><p>
The laws passed at the last session will be a monument of evil or of good. They cover such vast sums, 
delegate and regulate such vast powers, and are so farreaching in their effects, that generations will be affected 
well or ill by them. These measures are distinguished 
as much by what were omitted as by what were adopted. 
The negro was not legislated upon. The laws of confiscation, emancipation, &c., were left precisely upon the 
basis of previous laws, the proclamations of the President and ultimate decisions of the courts. The arming 
and employment of negroes is left upon the old law and 
mainly to the discretion of the President. There was 
but little speech-making and that mainly to the matter 
in hand. The Union or rather Republican members 
made scarcely a political speech in either house. They 
felt too constantly the pressure of practical measures 
demanding action. On the whole, the recent Congress 
may fairly appeal to their constituents for a favorable 
judgment upon the general aggregate of their acts. For 
myself, I do not reproach myself with any glaring fault. 
I opposed arbitrary arrests, general confiscation, the 
destruction of State lines and other extreme measures, 
and thereby have lost the confidence of some of my old 
friends. On the other hand, I have taken my full share 
in framing and supporting other great measures that 
have proved a success, and think I may fairly claim 
credit for many of the most valuable features of our 
financial system, which has been wonderfully sustained 
under enormous expenditure. I can also claim the paternity of the Bank Law yet to be tested by experience, 
and for the main features of the Conscription Law. 
This latter law is vital to our success, and although it 
was adopted with fear and trembling and only after all 
other expedients failed, yet I am confident it will be 
enforced with the/ general acquiescence of the people 
and that through i/t we see the road to peace. But after 
all, Congress cannot help us out of our difficulties. It 
may by its acts ajid omissions prolong the war, but there 
is no solution to it except through the military forces. 
The people have got beyond the first danger of the war. 
They no longer underrate the power of the Confederates 
and no longer expect a short or holiday war. When 
coming home at Philadelphia, and in the cars, and here 
among plain people I find a healthy feeling. They want 
peace. But very few would accept it on any other terms 
than the preservation of the Union. They know very 
well that the South will only yield to this after being 
thoroughly whipped, and this has not been done.

I am very much rejoiced that you did not act upon 
your hasty impressions about resigning. The history 
of your <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> expedition is now well understood 
and you stand well with all classes. 
</p><p>
Most of the papers who joined in the clamor against 
you have corrected their statements. You never lost the 
confidence of the department and especially of Stanton and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a>. . . .

Affectionately yours,
