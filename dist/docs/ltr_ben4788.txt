DEAR POLLY, 
</p><p>
I wrote a few lines to you last Week, in answer to yours 
of the 5th, since which I have been in the Country; and, 
returning yesterday, found your good Mother was come home, 
and had got a Letter from you of the 2oth. She has just put 
it into my hands, and desires me to write to you, as she is 
going into the City with Miss Barwell to buy things. Whether 
she will have time to write herself I cannot say, or whether, 
if she had, she would get over her natural Aversion to writing. 
I rather think she will content herself with your knowing 
what she should say, and would say, if she wrote ; and with 
my letting you know, that she is well, and very happy in 
hearing that you are so. 
</p><p>
Your Friends are all much pleas'd with your account of the 
agreable Family, their kind Reception and Entertainment 
of you, and the Respect shown you. Only Dolly and I, 
tho' we rejoice and shall do so in every thing that contributes 
to your Happiness, are now and then in low Spirits, supposing 
we have lost each a Friend. Barwell says she conceives 
nothing of this ; and that we must be two Simpletons to entertain such Imaginations. I showed her your Letter to your 
Mother, wherein you say, " Dolly is a naughty Girl, and, 
if she does not mend, I shall turn her off ; for I have got another Dolly now, and a very good Dolly too." She begg'd 
me not to communicate this to Dolly, for tho' said in jest, 
yet, in her present State of mind, it would hurt her. I suppose 
that it was for the same good-natur'd Reason, that she refus'd 
to show me a Paragraph of your Letter to Dolly, that had been 
communicated by Dolly to her. 
</p><p>
July 25. The above was written yesterday, but, being 
interrupted, I could not finish my Letter in time for the Post ; 
tho' I find I had little to add. Your Mother desires me to 
express abundance of Affection for you, and to Mr. Hewson ; 
and to say all the proper Things for her, with respect to the 
rest of your Friends there. But you can imagine better than 
I can write. Sally and little Temple ' join in best Wishes 
of Prosperity to you both. Make my sincere Respects 
acceptable to Mr. Hewson, whom, exclusive of his other 
Merits, I shall always esteem in proportion to the Regard 
he manifests for you. Barwell tells me, that your Aunt had 
receiv'd his Letter, and was highly pleas'd with it and him ; 
so I hope all will go well there ; and I shall take every Opportunity of cultivating her good Dispositions, in which I think 
you us'd to be sometimes a little backward, but you always 
had your Reasons. 
</p><p>
I am apt to love everybody that loves you, and therefore 
I suppose I shall in time love your new Mother, and new 
Sister, and your new Dolly. I find I begin to like them already, and, if you think proper, you may tell them so. But your old Dolly and I have agreed to love each other better 
than ever we did, to make up as much as we can our suppos'd 
Loss of you. We like your Assurances of continued Friendship, unimpair'd by your Change of Condition, and we believe you think as you write; but we fancy we know better 
than you. You know I once knew your Heart better than 
you did yourself. As a Proof that I am right, take notice, 
that you now think this the silliest Letter I ever wrote to you, 
and that Mr. Hewson confirms you in that Opinion. 
</p><p>
However, I am still what I have been so many Years, my 
dear good Girl, your sincerely affectionate Friend and Servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
