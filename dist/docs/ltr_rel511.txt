<p><i>[Biographers Note:On account of rheumatism, my mother was anxious to go to the Hot Springs
in Bath County.  She was now staying at Audley, Clarke County,
Virginia, with Mrs. Lorenzo Lewis, who had just sent her six sons into
the army.  Bath County was not very far from the seat of war in western
Virginia, and my father was asked as to the safety of the Hot Springs
from occupation by the enemy.  He writes as follows to my mother:]</i>

I have received, dearest Mary, your letter of August 18th from Audley,
and am very glad to get news of your whereabouts....  I am very glad
you are enabled to see so many of your friends.  I hope you have found
all well in your tour, and am very glad that our cousin Esther bears
the separation from all her sons so bravely.  I have no doubt they
will do good service in our Southern cause, and wish they could be
placed according to their fancies....  I fear you have postponed your
visit to the Hot too late.  It must be quite cold there now, judging
from the temperature here, and it has been raining in these mountains
since July 24th....  I see Fitzhugh quite often, though he is encamped
four miles from me.  He is very well and not at all harmed by the
campaign.

We have a great deal of sickness among the soldiers, and now those
on the sick-list would form an army.  The measles is still among them,
though I hope it is dying out.  But it is a disease which though light
in childhood is severe in manhood, and prepares the system for other
attacks.  The constant cold rains, with no shelter but tents, have
aggravated it.  All these drawbacks, with impassable roads, have
paralysed our efforts.  Still I think you will be safe at the Hot, for
the present.  We are right up to the enemy on three lines, and in the
Kanawha he has been pushed beyond the Gauley....  My poor little Rob
I never hear from scarcely.  He is busy, I suppose, and knows not
where to direct....
