My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your letters of the I st & 13th  ins f with two notes one by Majr Sparks 
accompanied by several interesting slips cut from different newspapers & 
the official organ have all reached me, the one of the I st last evening in 
consequence of some irregularity in our mails, & that of the 13th  some 
five or six days previously; both have been read with deep interest & 
great satisfaction, for which in addition to the Union, which I have not 
yet read for want of time, & the slips &c I tender you my most cordial 
thanks. I have no doubt the mistake about the draft in question origi 
nated with myself, I got two from the Q r Master Cap 1 Sibley at the same 
time, one for 400 hundred dollars intended for Mr s Taylor, the other five 
hundred intended for you ; they were enclosed in a great hurry in the 
night, the one for five was sent by mistake to Mr s T. & in like manner 
the one for four was sent to you. This will be all rectified the moment I 
hear of the arrival of the letter containing the same at Baton Rouge ; 
your letters or in fact any others do not reach here with anything like 
regularity, but when they do, they are read with interest & are a source 
of pleasure to me, so that you need make no apology as to number or 
length ; all that I ask of you is not to expect me to answer the whole of 
them, or to write very long as well, for really I have not the time to 
do so 
</p><p>
I think it was better to have Rob at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> than to have sent him 
contrary to his wishes to Kentucky, & hope he will attend closely to his 
studies & will prepare himself for college should you determine on send 
ing him to finish his education at one or to prepare him for any other 
pursuit. John I hope will get on to his place of destination without accident. I have no doubt he will pass his examination with credit, & I hope 
to live to see him occupying respecticable rank, & an ornament to the profession, & an honor to his country; which cannot fail to be the case, if he 
is sober, prudent & studious, which I am truly in hopes will be the case. 
I hope you will succeed in getting a good teacher for the girls, & that you 
will be able to have them well educated, substantially so, if not showy. 
At any rate they ought to be able to read & write & speak their own 
language correctly, in addition to fluency & ease. As Dick will leave for 
some of the watering places, I doubt if Betty will be able to make you the 
visit contemplated, as in that case her mother would be left alone.

I was aware there was many serious objections to your present 
position & pointed them out to you soon after you was assigned to the 
same, among the rest that a proper school for the children was referred 
to, in addition to the trouble & expense of removing Ann & the children 
to some healthy place should any contagious disease make its appearance 
at the Barracks during a part of the summer & autum, which I consider 
the greatest objection to the place, but it was "Hopsons choice," that or 
Mexico, the latter of course involving the separation with your family, to 
avoid the course you pursued I considered the most you could have 
pursued 
</p><p>
It seems to me as regards Mr 8 Dudley, while you or your family 
should make no advances for a reconciliation, yet if she thought proper 
to do so, I see no reason why it should not be met ; as I know nothing 
which she has done to bar the exchange of common courticies of life, 
even if there should be no intimacy among the parties; she Mr s Dudley 
done no more than most ambitious women would have done, under simi 
lar circumstances, & I was satisfied if she outlived her husband she would 
control his property, & leave it to her relatives; this should be no cause 
of quarrel or heart burning among you all, particularly so far as you was 
individually concerned, as you are not dependent on her, which let her 
see, by treating her on acct of what had passed with marked but dignified 
politeness should you ever meet her. There is no telling at what moment 
we may be called to another scene of action from which none return, & it 
is the part of wisdom to be always prepared for such an event, & the rear 
ing up our children & establishing them in life so that they can sustain 
themselves is in my opinion the most important of our duties 
</p><p>
I have read the copies of the enclosed letters referred to & feel greatly 
indebted both to Mr S. & Mr H. for the complimentary manner they 
have been pleased to notice my services, & their wishes on the subject of 
the presidency, & their views as to my course touching the same; as well 
as my obligations to Gen B. for communicating the views of the former, 
& to yourself for the way in which you replied to the latter. But I should 
regret any one spending a cent to secure my election, for if I enter the 
White House to occupy it, it must be by the spontaneous move of the 
people, & not by any agency of mine in the matter, as I am not at all 
anxious for the office under any circumstances, & will be <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">the President</a> of 
the people if at all, & not of a party; at the same time I regret the sub 
ject has been agitated so long before the election, as there will be many 
"Richmonds in the field" by the time or before the coming election, & 
of course much slang & abuse will be indulged in by the aspirants & their 
creatures to break down the most prominent for said office, much 
of which would have been avoided, had the cavas been put off until this 
time next year. I consider the wish of Dr B. to relieve you at your pres 
ent position without consultin your wishes was rather assuming too much 
& I certainly must thank Gen B. for his manly & soldierly course in this 
matter in sustaining you ; also for his good wishes as regards my reaching 
the first civil office in the country, all of which I wish you to present to 
him. I shall write nothing which if published will give me any concern ; 
courtesy will make it proper for me to reply to many of the numerous 
letters addressed me in relation to the office in question ; but my answers 
will be guarded, & in very Gen terms ; & those who do not like them 
may vote for who ever they please 
</p><p>
Was the election to come off this fall instead of the I make no doubt 
was the election at hand I would be elected to the highest of office in the 
gift of the people, which would be the most signal rebuke ever ministered 
to a party under similar circumstance ; but many changes may take place 
between now and Nov r 1 848 which may entirely change the tide of public 
opinion in favor of some other individual, as nothing is more uncertain 
than popular favor. I wish Col Nicholas had deferred the nomination 
referred to until the next session of their legislature 
</p><p>
I think I understand both Worth & Scott pretty well, they both 
operate considerably through their creatures, particularly the former; but 
it may be best to meet such people in accordance with their professions 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> in my opinion will be a candidate for the succession, &; 
may prove a very formidable one ; if the present party in power find them 
selves in a desperate situation they may take him up, which I think quite 
likely he giving certain pledges, which he will not hesitate to do; he will 
it seems to me carry with him a considerable portion of the Whig party, 
but whether enough to elect him time must determine You may be satisfied of one thing that if an other individual who is honest capable & faith 
ful to the constitution should be elevated to that office, than myself, it 
will give me not a moments concern, much less a moments pain ; on the 
contrary I shall rejoice that the republic possess a more capable & worthy 
citizen for that station than myself The <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a> Journal is an ably 
conducted paper, & devoted or will be to my interest for the presidency, 
if you have subscribed for it, I would be glad you would forward it to 
me, after reading it. The Union is regularly sent to us, so you need give 
yourself no trouble in sending it The city is & no doubt will be filled 
with officers & no doubt will continue so until the close of this war. 
</p><p>
I deeply regret to hear of Capt Swift s death, which will prove a 
dreadful blow to his parents & family 
</p><p>
Should this war continue I do not expect to be given a proper force 
to justify my marching into the heart of Mexico, the twelve months 
Volunteers will all in the course of five or six days, be on their way to 
their homes, which will leave me very weak on this line ; in fact it is so 
at present. I had calculated that the new regt s ordered to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Point Isabel" rel="city">Point Isabel</a>, 
would have formed a part of my com d but the last mail brought me an 
order from Washington directing Gen Cadwallader to proceed with the 
greater portion to Vera Cruz, & report to, or join <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a>, the latter 
had also ordered the same com d to join him, which order reached Brazos 
a few days before the one from Washington. Those arrangements leave 
me, with three of the new regt s of foot one of which I understand very 
little has been done toward filling its ranks ; Tibbats is one of them, & 
perhaps the 3 d dragoons to be mounted, so say the ad f Gen of the army. 
Col Taylor has been ordered out & I presume will be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> soon 
after this gets there. Jarvis has not yet arrived 
</p><p>
P. S. Just as I closed my note to you, the mail arrived a moment 
since & brought me your very acceptable letter of the i6 th & 2o th ins 
accompanied by papers & scraps for which as usual you have my most 
cordial thanks 
</p><p>
I can but feel gratified as to the complimentary terms your old 
acquaintance & friend Mr Shelton has thought proper to allude to my 
services &c for which I sincerely thank him. 
</p><p>
The brilliant illuminations in New Orleans & elsewhere on acct of 
the success of our armies shows that our citizens duly appreciate the labors, 
privations & dangers encountered in the public servants by those 
employed by them, which demonstration of respect & gratitude must be 
consoling in some degree to those who have lost relatives, health & 
friends during this contest ; but the marked distinction which has been 
shewn me in these illuminations, as in many other ways throughout the 
country, particularly as many of them has been connected with the presidency, will only have the effect of bringing on me the hatred, envy & 
abuse of all the aspirants & their creatures tools &c which is now making 
their appearance in some of the public journals & which will be doubtless 
greatly increased in number by the Scott party & partisans 
</p><p>
I notice your remarks about the advantages & disadvantages as a 
station so far as you & yours was concerned, & with one exception the 
first objection, which may be bourn with of your present station which 
I pointed out more than once to you 
</p><p>
Kendalls article was no doubt written by the direction or under the 
supervision of Scott, to laud him S. & the administration ; of which 
both are complete sycophants 
</p><p>
I have just rec d by special express from Washington several communications from the Secretary of War & the Adjt Gen of the army, 
replying to comt s addressed to the dep t sometime since, which alth re 
spectful enough, are not at all satisfactory ; as they contain promises 
which cannot be fulfilled, for the purpose of creating expectations on the 
part of the people of the country in regard to myself, which can never 
be realized. If my friends had not connected my name with the office 
of the presidency which I very much regret, I would at once retire from 
the service, & devote myself to the management of my private affairs, 
but I do not wish to take any steps or adopt any course which would 
meet with their disapprobation ; but however much I may dislike to disappoint them, I may & very probably to this course ; among other 
matters brought by the bearer of the despatches from Washington, is 
instructions placing me under the orders of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a>, which is in 
effect superseding me, & which seem to me ought to incline me to ask to 
be recalled, & to resign if not acceded to 
</p><p>
I was pleased to hear that Dick was on his way to the Arkensas 
Springs, & hope he will not missapply his time on the way there, but will 
get there without delay & give the water a fair trial Alth feeling 
great anxiety about him I was glad to learn that John was on his way 
to Annapolis, he carries with him my best wishes for his health & 
prosperity 
</p><p>
It was gratifying to me to know that the water had receded from the 
plantation as it may enable me to raise plenty of corn for the coming 
year.
