TO GENERAL U.S. GRANT.
</p><p>
EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,<br/>
October 21, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1862">1862</a>.
</p><p>
MAJOR-GENERAL U. S. GRANT:
</p><p>
The bearer of this, Thomas R. Smith, a citizen of Tennessee, goes to
that State seeking to have such of the people thereof as desire to
avoid the unsatisfactory prospect before them, and to have peace
again upon the old terms, under the Constitution of the United
States, to manifest such desire by elections of members to the
Congress of the United States particularly, and perhaps a
Legislature, State officers, and a United States senator friendly to
their object.
</p><p>
I shall be glad for you and each of you to aid him, and all others
acting for this object, as much as possible. In all available ways
give the people a show to express their wishes at these elections.
</p><p>
Follow law, and forms of law, as far as convenient, but at all events
get the expression of the largest number of the people possible. All
see how such action will connect with and affect the proclamation of
September 22. Of course the men elected should be gentlemen of
character, willing to swear support to the Constitution as of old,
and known to be above reasonable suspicion of duplicity.
</p><p>
Yours very respectfully,
</p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=abl" rel="me">A. LINCOLN.</a>
