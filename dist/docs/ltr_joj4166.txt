Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your letter of the 2d inst., and expected to have answered it this week in person. My health had so much mended, that on Friday last, I rode to Bedford 
for the first time since my return. That night, rheumatic pains in my head, neck, and shoulders came on. They have somewhat abated, but still confine me to the house, 
In our journey through life, as in other journeys, our wishes cannot always be gratified. Travellers must expect to live and fare like travellers. 
</p><p>
You have the gout, and you extract consolation from it ; this is good moral chymistry. My rheumatism and your gout may perhaps carry us home the farthest way round, 
but not in an easy chair. When we " ruminate past enjoyments," we taste that tincture of melancholy which their departure and other associated circumstances infuse : it 
nevertheless affords a kind of pleasure which, like some medical wine, is not only better than no wine, but perhaps 
in some respects more salutary than pure wine. The half a century you speak of, has given us some 
knowledge and experience, both of men and things. That experience leads me to concur cordially in your idea of 
cultivating sentiments of friendship ; and particularly to cherish those with which I am, 
</p><p>
Yours, very sincerely, 
</p><p>
