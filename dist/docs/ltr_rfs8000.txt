My Dear Commodore : It is very important to take <a href="/results.php?tla=jas" rel="adversary">General Castro</a> or to drive him out of the country. Until one or the other is done, I see no hope of restoring peace and good order to this territory. 
</p><p>
I wish to send the Cyane with <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague">Captain Fremont's</a> men to the southward, to head him off. and drive him back here. 
</p><p>
Had you not better send me an order to take command at once, and make my own arrangements ? 
</p><p>
It will facilitate operations, and relieve you from a great deal of trouble. 
</p><p>
Faithfully your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
(Signed) <a href="/results.php?tla=rfs" rel="me">R. F. Stockton</a>.

To Commodore J. D. Sloat, etc., etc., Flag-Ship Savannah.
