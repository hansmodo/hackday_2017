Sir, 
</p><p>
The Minister of France has written me a letter, of 
which the inclosed is a copy. As this crisis of affairs 
eminent support during the late war, and being for 
the purpose of quelling an internal rebellion, no foreign nation can take umbrage at the measure. As 
it can be afforded without impediment or injury to 
the public service, and, as all the stores in the arsenals are under your direction, as President of the 
United States and Commander-in-chief, I feel but 
little hesitation in submitting, as my opinion, that the 
circumstances of the case render it highly proper to 
afford the supplies requested, and that your authority 
is competent to the occasion. 
</p><p>
I am. Sir, with the highest respect, &c., 
</p><p>
