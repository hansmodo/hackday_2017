MY DEAR LORD, 
</p><p>
I received your obliging favour of January the ipth. You 
have kindly relieved me from the pain I had long been under. 
You are goodness itself. I ought to have answered yours 
of December 25. <a href='/results.php?year=1765'>1765</a>. I never received a letter that 
contained sentiments more suitable to my own. It found 
me under much agitation of mind on the very important 
subject it treated. It fortified me greatly in the judgment I 
was inclined to form (though contrary to the general vogue) 
on the then delicate and critical situation of affairs between 
Great Britain and her Colonies, and on that weighty point, 
their Union. You guessed aright in supposing that I would 
not be a mute in that play. I was extremely busy, attending 
Members of both Houses, informing, explaining, consulting, 
disputing, in a continual hurry from morning to night, till 
the affair was happily ended. During the course of it, being 
called before the House of Commons, I spoke my mind pretty 
freely. Inclosed I send you the imperfect account that was 
taken of that examination. " You will there see how entirely 
we agree, except in a point of fact, of which you could not but 
be misinformed ; the papers at that time being full of mistaken 
assertions, that the colonies had been the cause of the war, 
and had ungratefully refused to bear any part of the expence 
of it. 
</p><p>
I send it you now, because I apprehend some late incidents 
are likely to revive the contest between the two countries. I 
fear it will be a mischievous one. It becomes a matter of 
great importance that clear ideas should be formed on solid 
principles, both in Britain and America, of the true political 
relation between them, and the mutual duties belonging to 
that relation. Till this is done, they will be often jarring. 
I know none whose knowledge, sagacity and impartiality 
qualify him so thoroughly for such a service, as yours do you. 
I wish therefore you would consider it. You may thereby 
be the happy instrument of great good to the nation, and of 
preventing much mischief and bloodshed. I am fully persuaded with you, that a Consolidating Union, by a fair and 
equal representation of all the parts of this empire in Parliament, is the only firm basis on which its political grandeur 
and prosperity can be founded. Ireland once wished it, 
but now rejects it. The time has been, when the colonies 
might have been pleased with it: they are now indifferent 
about it; and if it is much longer delayed, they too will refuse it. But the pride of this people cannot bear the thought 
of it, and therefore it will be delayed. Every man in England seems to consider himself as a piece of a sovereign over 
America; seems to jostle himself into the throne with the 
King, and talks of our subjects in the Colonies. The Parliament cannot well and wisely make laws suited to the Colonies, 
without being properly and truly informed of their circumstances, abilities, temper, &c. This it cannot be, without 
representatives from thence : and yet it is fond of this power, 
and averse to the only means of acquiring the necessary knowledge for exercising it ; which is desiring to be omnipotent, without being omniscient. 
</p><p>
I have mentioned that the contest is likely to be revived. 
It is on this occasion. In the same session with the stamp 
act, an act was passed to regulate the quartering of soldiers 
in America; when the bill was first brought in, it contained 
a clause, empowering the officers to quarter their soldiers in 
private houses : this we warmly opposed, and got it omitted. 
The bill passed, however, with a clause, that empty houses, 
barns, &c., should be hired for them, and that the respective 
provinces where they were should pay the expence and furnish 
firing, bedding, drink, and some other articles to the soldiers 
gratis. There is no way for any province to do this, but 
by the Assembly's making a law to raise the money. The 
Pennsylvanian Assembly has made such a law: the New 
York Assembly has refused to do it: and now all the talk 
here is of sending a force to compel them. 
</p><p>
The reasons given by the Assembly to the Governor, for 
the refusal, are, that they understand the act to mean the 
furnishing such things to soldiers, only while on their march 
through the country, and not to great bodies of soldiers, to 
be fixt as at present, in the province; the burthen in the 
latter case being greater than the inhabitants can bear: 
That it would put it in the power of the Captain- General to oppress the province at pleasure, &c. But there is supposed to be another reason at bottom, which they intimate, 
though they do not plainly express it ; to wit, that it is of the 
nature of an internal tax laid on them by Parliament, which 
has no right so to do. Their refusal is here called Rebellion, 
and punishment is thought of. 
</p><p>
Now waving that point of right, and supposing the Legislatures in America subordinate to the Legislature of Great 
Britain, one might conceive, I think, a power in the superior 
Legislature to forbid the inferior Legislatures making particular laws ; but to enjoin it to make a particular law contrary to its own judgment, seems improper; an Assembly 
or Parliament not being an executive officer of Government, 
whose duty it is, in law-making, to obey orders, but a deliberative body, who are to consider what comes before them, 
its propriety, practicability, or possibility, and to determine 
accordingly : The very nature of a Parliament seems to be 
destroyed, by supposing it may be bound, and compelled 
by a law of a superior Parliament, to make a law contrary to 
its own judgment. 
</p><p>
Indeed, the act of Parliament in question has not, as in 
other acts, when a duty is enjoined, directed a penalty on 
neglect or refusal, and a mode of recovering that penalty. 
It seems, therefore, to the people in America as a mere 
requisition, which they are at liberty to comply with or not, 
as it may suit or not suit the different circumstances of different provinces. Pennsylvania has therefore voluntarily complied. <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as I said before, has refused. The 
Ministry that made the act, and all their adherents, call for 
vengeance. The present Ministry are perplext, and the 
measures they will finally take on the occasion, are yet unknown. But sure I am, that, if Force is used, great mischief 
will ensue; the affections of the people of America to this 
country will be alienated ; your commerce will be diminished ; 
and a total separation of interests be the final consequence. 
</p><p>
It is a common, but mistaken notion here, that the Colonies 
were planted at the expence of Parliament, and that therefore 
the Parliament has a right to tax them, &c. The truth is, 
they were planted at the expence of private adventurers, who 
went over there to settle, with leave of the King, given by 
charter. On receiving this leave, and those charters, the adventurers voluntarily engaged to remain the King's subjects, 
though in a foreign country ; a country which had not been 
conquered by either King or Parliament, but was possessed 
by a free people. 
</p><p>
When our planters arrived, they purchased the lands of 
the natives, without putting King or Parliament to any expence. Parliament had no hand in their settlement, was 
never so much as consulted about their constitution, and took 
no kind of notice of them, till many years after they were 
established. I except only the two modern Colonies, or 
rather attempts to make Colonies, (for they succeed but 
poorly, and as yet hardly deserve the name of Colonies), I 
mean Georgia and Nova Scotia, which have hitherto been 
little better than Parliamentary jobs. Thus all the colonies 
acknowledge the King as their sovereign; his Governors 
there represent his person : Laws are made by their Assemblies or little Parliaments, with the Governor's assent, subject still to the King's pleasure to confirm or annul them: 
Suits arising in the Colonies, and differences between Colony 
and Colony, are determined by the King in Council. In 
this view, they seem so many separate little states, subject 
to the same Prince. The sovereignty of the King is therefore 
easily understood. But nothing is more common here than 
to talk of the sovereignty of PARLIAMENT, and the sovereignty 
of THIS NATION over the Colonies; a kind of sovereignty, 
the idea of which is not so clear, nor does it clearly appear 
on what foundation it is established. On the other hand, it 
seems necessary for the common good of the empire, that a 
power be lodged somewhere, to regulate its general commerce : 
this can be placed nowhere so properly as in the Parliament 
of Great Britain; and therefore, though that power has in 
some instances been executed with great partiality to Britain, 
and prejudice to the Colonies, they have nevertheless always 
submitted to it. Custom-houses are established in all of 
them, by virtue of laws made here, and the duties constantly 
paid, except by a few smugglers, such as are here and in all 
countries; but internal taxes laid on them by Parliament, 
are still and ever will be objected to, for the reasons that you 
will see in the mentioned Examination. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, I have lived so great a part of my life in 
Britain, and have formed so many friendships in it, that I 
love it, and sincerely wish it prosperity ; and therefore wish 
to see that Union, on which alone I think it can be secured 
and established. As to America, the advantages of such a 
union to her are not so apparent. She may suffer at present 
under the arbitrary power of this country; she may suffer 
for a while in a separation from it ; but these are temporary 
evils that she will outgrow. Scotland and Ireland are differently circumstanced. Confined by the sea, they can scarcely 
increase in numbers, wealth and strength, so as to overbalance England. But America, an immense territory, 
favoured by Nature with all advantages of climate, soil, 
great navigable rivers, and lakes, &c. must become a great 
country, populous and mighty ; and will, in a less time than 
is generally conceived, be able to shake off any shackles that 
may be imposed on her, and perhaps place them on the imposers. In the mean time, every act of oppression will sour 
their tempers, lessen greatly, if not annihilate the profits of 
your commerce with them, and hasten their final revolt; 
for the seeds of liberty are universally found there, and nothing can eradicate them. And yet, there remains among 
that people, so much respect, veneration and affection for 
Britain, that, if cultivated prudently, with kind usage, and 
tenderness for their privileges, they might be easily governed 
still for ages, without force, or any considerable expence. 
But I do not see here a sufficient quantity of the wisdom, 
that is necessary to produce such a conduct, and I lament 
the want of it.

I borrowed at Millar's the new edition of your Principles 
o) Equity, and have read with great pleasure the preliminary 
discourse on the Principles of Morality. I have never before 
met with any thing so satisfactory on the subject. While 
reading it, I made a few remarks as I went along. They are 
not of much importance, but I send you the paper. 
</p><p>
I know the lady you mention ; ' having, when in England 
before, met her once or twice at Lord Bath's. I remember I 
then entertained the same opinion of her that you express. 
On the strength of your kind recommendation, I purpose 
soon to wait on her.

This is unexpectedly grown a long letter. The visit to 
Scotland, and the Art of Virtue, we will talk of hereafter. It 
is now time to say, that I am, with increasing esteem and 
affection, my dear friend, yours ever, B. FRANKLIN.
