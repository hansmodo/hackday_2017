DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your kind letter of October 18. I had before 
seen with great pleasure your name in the papers as chosen 
for the city of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
The instruction you mention, as proposed by a certain great 
man, was really a wild one. The reasons you made use of 
against it were clear and strong, and could not but prevail. 
It will be time enough to show a dislike to the coalition when it is proposed to us. Meanwhile we have all the advantage 
in the argument of taxation, which our not being represented 
will continue to give us. I think, indeed, that such an event 
is very remote. This nation is indeed too proud to propose 
admitting American representatives into their Parliament; 
and America is not so humble, or so fond of the honour, as to 
petition for it. In matrimonial matches 'tis said, when one 
party is willing the match is half made, but where neither 
party is willing there is no great danger of their coming 
together. And to be sure such an important business would 
never be treated of by agents unimpowered and uninstructed ; 
nor would government here act upon the private opinion of 
agents, which might be disowned by their constituents. 
</p><p>
The present ministry seem now likely to continue through 
this session; and this, as a new election approaches, gives 
them the advantage of getting so many of their friends chosen 
as may give a stability to their administration. I heartily 
wish it, because they are all well disposed towards America. 
</p><p>
With sincere esteem, I am, dear Sir, your affectionate friend 
and most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
