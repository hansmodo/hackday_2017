</p><p>
DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I expected to have been on my way to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> before this, 
but Mr. Hamilton is gone into the country, and I cannot be 
supplied with my instructions until he returns. He has been 
expected every hour these four days, and it is very possible 
that four days hence he may still be hourly expected. In the 
meanwhile I am here lolling away my time, and sweating 
away my person, with nothing to do and waiting with as 
much patience as I have at command. I am unable to say, 
therefore, when I shall leave this place, but hope it will be 
by the middle of this week. 
</p><p>
But I presume that my instructions after all will contain 
nothing very particular. The Secretary of State says that 
the mission is almost exclusively reduced to a pecuniary 
negotiation. 
</p><p>
To have nothing further to do but to borrow money and 
superintend the loans already existing, is an employment to 
which for a certain time I have no reluctance in submitting. 
It is a situation in which my services may be of some small 
utility to my country, and which may afford me a valuable 
opportunity to improve my information and talents ; but 
I cannot think of it with any satisfaction as a permanency, 
whether I consider it with reference to the public or to my 
self. 
</p><p>
As it respects the public, it is a situation of small trust 
and confidence under the present circumstances. The 
credit of the United States stands upon such ground that 
very little or none of their future success or failure will de 
pend upon the personal character or abilities of their representative there. And I presume the executive government 
of this country will not think it necessary to keep a Minister 
constantly resident at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a> for the sole purpose of 
occasionally borrowing a sum of money for the public at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>. 
</p><p>
Should that however be the policy of the government, and 
should it be at my option to continue from year to year in 
this state of nominal respectability and real insignificance, it 
is proper for me to determine how long I shall bear it. And 
this is a subject of much reflection and much anxiety to my 
mind. 
</p><p>
I have abandoned the profession upon which I have 
hitherto depended for a future subsistence. Abandoned it 
at a time when the tedious novitiate of hope and fear was 
nearly past ; when flattering and brightening prospects 
were every day opening more and more extensively to my 
view ; when I was at least upon a footing of equal advantage 
with any one of my own standing in the profession, and 
advancing if not rapidly at least with regular progression 
towards eminence ; when the reward of long and painful expectation began to unfold itself to my sight and give me a 
rational hope of future possession. At this critical moment, 
when all the materials for a valuable reputation at the bar 
were collected and had just begun to operate favorably for me, 
I have stopped short in my career, forsaken the path which 
would have led me to independence and security in private 
life, and stepped into a totally different direction. 
</p><p>
To that profession I can never return without losing many 
of the advantages which rendered its practice tolerable. The reputation which hitherto I had acquired was still very 
much confined and limited ; it was founded upon four years 
of constant application and attention to business. My 
absence will not only stop its growth, but will carry me back 
to that obscurity in which I began. The study of the common and statute law has nothing attractive to secure any 
attention to it unless some inducement of immediate interest 
serves as a stimulus. My business and my studies in the 
character which I am now to assume have very little affinity 
with those of a practising lawyer. I shall probably have 
but little leisure, and shall not be disposed to devote it to 
Kings Bench or Chancery Reports, to Littleton's Tenures 
or Coke's Commentaries. Yet these studies must essentially 
be uninterrupted to preserve the learning of a lawyer, and 
two or three years intermission will have the double effect 
of disgusting me with them, and of disqualifying me from 
the practise of the law without a redoubled application to them. 
</p><p>
In proportion as my own professional advancement will 
be checked that of my contemporaries, and particularly of 
those who started from the goal nearly at the same time 
with myself, will be promoted. They will continue to make 
their way, and will in a few years have reached the summit 
of reputation and of business. My juniors who are now 
just opening their offices, or are yet students, will then have 
reached the station from which I have departed, and thus 
after having been elevated to a public station much beyond 
my own wishes and expectations, and invested with a 
character more conspicuous than those of my fellow citizens of equal years and standing in the world, in returning 
to the bar I shall descend as much below the level of my 
ambition and pretensions as I have been by my present 
appointment raised above it. 
</p><p>
The profession, therefore, can be considered by me in no 
other light than that of a last resort, in case all other re 
sources should fail ; and yet I have no reason to suppose 
that anything more eligible will occur to me in case I should 
at the end of two or three years be destitute of public employment. 
</p><p>
Unpleasant however as this perspective is, I think it in 
finitely preferable to that of remaining in the public service 
to perform duties which may be executed equally well by 
any other man, and with the consciousness of holding a 
public office without confidence, without utility, and for no 
other purpose than barely to give me a subsistence. 
</p><p>
The idea of being many years absent from my country, 
from my family, my connections and friends, is so painful, 
that I feel a necessity for fixing upon some period to which 
I may look forward with an expectation of being restored to 
them. The distance between the two countries is so great 
and the communication of course so small, that it is hardly 
possible for an American to be long in Europe without losing 
in some measure his national character. The habits, the 
manners, and affections insensibly undergo an alteration, 
the common changes to which society is incident remove 
many of the friends and connections which he left behind 
him, and no others are substituted in their stead. His own 
propensities are so liable to follow the course of the stream 
into which he has been banished, that he gradually takes 
an European disposition, becomes a stranger to his own 
country, and, when at length he returns, finds himself an 
alien in the midst of his own fellow citizens. 
</p><p>
The attachment which I feel for my native land is not 
merely a sentiment of the heart, it is also a principle dictated 
by my reason. Independent of my feelings and inclinations, 
I hold it to be a duty of the most rigid obligation to make the place of my birth the centre of all my wishes, and the chief 
object of all my pursuits. Wherever my lot may be cast, I 
hope I shall always turn towards it with as much frequency of 
devotion and as constant veneration, as that with which the 
most faithful disciple of Mahomet presents his face towards 
the tomb of his prophet. I cannot therefore look forward 
with indifference to any situation that shall have a tendency 
to loosen the ties which connect me with my country. I 
cannot anticipate without concern a length of absence, 
which may give my inclinations a bias different from that of 
my duty. 
</p><p>
For these reasons I am convinced of the propriety there 
is in marking out for my own determination the limits of 
time for the duration of my present mission. It is very 
possible that I may have no occasion for any such limitation, 
and that my commission will be superseded by the will of the 
President, as soon or sooner than I shall desire ; but this is an 
event, which is wholly out of my control, and which there 
fore cannot enter into my calculations. 
</p><p>
If after three years residence at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a> I should see 
no particular object requiring my further continuance 
there; if the business of an American Minister there should 
continue to be the mere agency of a broker, and my office be 
of no benefit but to me, I shall feel myself under an obligation to return home and resume my profession, or any other 
employment in private life that shall afford me an honorable support. 
</p><p>
I have written very freely to you, Sir, upon this subject, 
because I wish to have the sanction of your opinion and your 
advice. The principle which I have adopted has been so 
consonant to your own practice, and has been in my mind so 
clearly the result of your instructions, that I think it cannot 
but meet with your approbation. Perhaps the time upon which I have fixed may not preserve so accurately the 
medium as I should wish, and if you are of that opinion, I 
must solicit you for the result of your reflections in writing, 
if it be not too inconvenient. Your kindness will excuse 
the unceasing egotism of this letter, which could admit of 
no apology, were it not directed to the indulgence of a parent, 
for the purpose of obtaining the guidance of paternal wis 
dom. . . .
