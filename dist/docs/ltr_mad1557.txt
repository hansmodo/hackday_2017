DEAR SIR, ******* 
We hear nothing from any of the other States on the subject 
of the federal Convention. The ice seems to have intercepted 
totally the Northern communication for a considerable time 
past. The Assembly have been much occupied of late with the 
bill for district Courts. On the final question there was a majority of one against it, in fact, though on the count a mistake 
made the division equal, and it fell to the Chair to decide, who 
passed the bill. The real majority, however, were sensible of 
the mistake, and refused to agree to the title, threatening a secession at the same time. The result was a compromise, that 
the question should be decided anew the next morning, when 
the bill was lost in a full house by a single voice. It is now 
proposed to extend the Session of the General Court so as to 
accelerate the business depending there. We hear that Maryland is much agitated on the score of paper money, the House 
of Delegates having decided in favour of an emission.
