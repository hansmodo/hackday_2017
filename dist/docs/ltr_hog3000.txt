SIR, 
</p><p>
Yesterday I had the honor to receive your Excellency's letter of the 14th instant, which is all I have 
been favored with since that of the 19th July. I 
have at length the satisfaction to send a pretty correct general return of the army in this part of the 
northern district of America. A copy of my last 
letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel=''>General Schuyler</a>, which is in the packet, 
will explain the return to your Excellency. I also 
inclose my orders and instructions to Lieutenant Whitcomb, who went from hence the 20th instant upon 
a scout towards St. John s, Chamblee, &c. The report of his last scout, which <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel=''>General Sullivan</a> sent 
him upon, has already been sent to <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel=''>General Schuyler</a>, who has doubtless transmitted it to your Excellency. 
</p><p>
As the smallpox is now perfectly removed from 
the army, I shall, in consequence of the intelligence 
received of the motions of the enemy, immediately 
assemble my principal strength to maintain this important pass ; and hope General Waterbury, in a 
week, at farthest, will be able to come with the 
three row-galleys to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and proceed, the instant they arrive and are fitted, to join General arnold upon the Lake. In the mean time, we are Exerting our utmost industry to fortify this post, a 
plan of which is inclosed. The weather of late has 
been so uncommonly wet and stormy for the season, 
that we are much retarded in our works. As the 
enemy feel alike the inclemency of the season, I 
hope we shall be prepared for them when they come. 
My orders to Brigadier-<a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel=''>General Arnold</a> your Excellency will find in the packet. lie read and entirely 
approved them before he left <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. I hope 
they are the sentiments of your Excellency, and the 
most Honorable the Congress, upon that momentous 
command. 
</p><p>
As the New Hampshire and Connecticut militia 
have come without tents, much time is lost, by those 
regiments, in covering themselves. It happens, very 
fortunately, that Mount Independence affords an ample supply of huts ; otherwise those corps must soon 
have felt great distress. The Massachusetts militia 
are arrived, well supplied with excellent tents, and a 
sufficiency of good camp utensils. This, in our present circumstances, is a great help to us, and does 
that Province much honor. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel=''>Governor Trumbull</a> acquaints me he has forwarded 
one thousand felling-axes and two loads of clothing. 
His Excellency has, from the beginning of the misfortunes of this army, done every thing in his power to 
establish it in health and power. Too much cannot 
be said in his praise. Your Excellency must, long 
ere this, have received from <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel=''>General Schuyler</a> the report of Major Bigelow, who returned with the flag of 
truce from <a href='/results.php?city=isle-aux-noix' rel='city'>Isle-aux-Noix</a>. As I constantly report 
every extraordinary occurrence to <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel=''>General Schuyler</a>, 
I take it for granted there is no delay with him in 
forwarding them to your Excellency and the congress. I have ordered Commissary A very to forward 
to Colonel Trumbull the returns and reports that are 
proper to be made in his department, and Dr. Morgan has, before this, shown your Excellency my letter to him of the 22d instant. 
</p><p>
I am pleased . at the account <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel=''>General Schuyler</a> 
gives me, of five hundred and thirteen thousand dollars being arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. It 
is much wanted both there and here, as the militia 
were promised their mileage and billeting-money at 
Number Four; but no money was sent there to pay 
them. This neglect caused much murmuring amongst 
them, and was very near stopping their march from 
thence. I wish good care was taken not to make 
any promises to troops but such as are punctually 
performed. I apprehend this promise was made by 
the Legislature at <a href='/results.php?city=watertown' rel='city'>Watertown</a>. I have the honor to 
be, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient, humble servant,
