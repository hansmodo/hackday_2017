ON BOARD BOAT CHARITON Thursday March 31, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1836">1836</a>
</p><p>
DEAR SlSTER JANE We did not leave last night as expected and the day being very pleasant gave me an opportunity of visiting the city. Received a call from an old acquaintance, Rev. Milton Kimball and with him visited the Cathedral. It was High Mass day. I wish I could describe the feelings I had in viewing their worship, if it may be so called. It appeared to me like idolatry. Their embroydered robes appeared to be of the richest material. Splendor and show characterized the place, and all their movements. But what was worse than all was to see young boys training in such a school of destruction. They appeared to be heaping all their honours upon one old man so far as I could understand their movements. Six boys dressed in white robes received each an article of dress of different discriptions at the hand of one of the priests, carried them in their arms one after the other to this old man who took them and with the assistance of one at his right hand loaded his person with them. While dressing some one stood before him with a looking-glass or a book. I could not distinkly see which, apparently very devout in all their movements. A censor completed the dress, and finally one bro't him a golden staff or rod. He took it, arose and walked to the altar, kneeled and seemed to be in the act of silent prayer, as he passed along his attendants and worshipers arose, to show their respect for the dignity of his station. His Holiness the Arch Bishop, I learned to be his title, after I left the house, from Br. Kimble. During the whole performance there was music of a character upon an organ very different from our church tunes and toward the last the Nuns sang the same strains in an unknown tongue. To us it seemed like sound without articulation. While sitting there and behold their idolatry, I thot of the "Whited Sepulcher which indeed appeared beautiful to men but within one full of dead mens bones and all uncleanness." I thot too of the many dellicate fingers that had been employed innocently perhaps, in all
manner of needle work preparing vestments for such hypocritical characters. What cause of gratitude, have I that I am not of the number who willfully shut my eyes to the truth, deceiving and being deceived.
</p><p>
We left the Cathedral after staying about an hour, called and made some purchases, then returned to the boat. Found that Mr. Lovejoy had called to give us an invitation to dinner with him. Felt to regret very much that I did not see him. My husband saw him. He wished to know when we were married beause he designed to publish it in the Observer. He still continues to edit his paper in St. Louis.
</p><p>
We left St. Louis immediately after dinner. Passed many delightful residences in Missouri, on the banks of the Mississippi, just as we leave the city. Dwellings situated upon mounds, and many remaining ones yet to be occupyed, Natural mounds in appearance like that in Amity, only much larger. One of them is the situation of a Female Academy, now in building. My next curiosity was Uncle Sam's Tooth Pullers. Two huge looking boats lying too. They fearlessly run into danger, search out difficulties, and remove them. I should like to see them in operation, but shall not expect too now.
</p><p>
Twilight had nearly gone when we entered the waters of the great Missouri. But the moon shone in her brightness. It was a beautiful evening. My husband and myself went upon the top of the boat to take a commanding view of the scenery. How majestic, how grand was the scene. The meeting of two such great waters. "Surely how admirable are thy works O Lord of Hosts." I could have dwelt upon the scene still longer with pleasure but Brother Spaulding called us to prayers and we left beholding the works of God for his immediate worship.
</p><p>
APRIL 1ST -- Nothing of much importance occured today. My eyes are satiated with the same beautiful scenery all along the coasts of this mighty river so peculiar to this western country. One year ago to day since my husband first arrived in St. Louis on his exploring route to the mountains. We are one week earlier passing up the river this spring than he was last year. While the boat stopt to take in wood, we went on shore, found some rushes, picked a branch of cedar, went to a spring for clean water (the river water is very rily at all times), rambled considerably in pursuit of new objects.
</p><p>
One of these circumstances I must mention, which was quite diverting to us. On the rocks near the river we found a great quantity of prickly pears. Husband knew from an experience the effects of handling them, and caution[ed] me against them, but I thot I could just take one & I put it in my India Rubber apron pocket and carry it to the boat. I did so, but after rambling a little, I thot to take it out and behold my pocket was filled with needles just like catterpiller's bristles. I became considerably anoyed with them. They covered my hands, and I have scarcely got rid of them yet.
</p><p>
My Husband would have laughed at me a little were it not for his own misfortune. He thot to discover what kind of mucilage it was by tasting it, cut one in two, bit it, and covered his lips completely. We then had to sympathize with each other and were glad to render mutual assistance in a case of extermination.
</p><p>
[APRIL] 2. Eve. ten o'clock. We have come on well since we left St. Louis, sailed all night last night which is a rare thing in this river on account of the snags and sand bars. We are now at Jefferson City, about half way to Liberty from St. L. How long we stop here, I do not know, perhaps all night.
</p><p>
MON. 4TH. We passed the wreck of the Steamboat Shiana to day about noon. It is indeed a melancholy sight. She was not quite a year old. She ran upon a snag and sank last winter. No lives lost. We stopped to day at Chariton about an hour. [I] We went on shore and visited a steam saw mill. It was quite a curiosity as well as the great engine that propells the boat upon the mighty waters. I forget and speak in the singular number when I should [say] we.
</p><p>
THURS. 7. Very pleasant but cold. This morning the thermometer stood at at nine o"clock. I have not seen any snow since we left the Allegany Mountains before the 15th of March. I should like to know about the snow in New York. Is it all gone? How did it go and the consequences? Mary, we have had a sick one with us all the way since we joined Doc. Satterlee. Mrs. Satterlee has had a very bad cough and cold which has left her feeble. 24 She is now recovering and is as well as can be expected. She is en famalle [sic]. The rest of us have been very well except feeling the effects of drinking the river water some. I am an exception however. My health is never better than since I have been on the river. I was weighed last week and came up to 136 pounds. I think I shall endure the journey well, perhaps better than any of the rest of us. Mrs. Spalding does not look nor feel quite healthy
enough for our enterprise. Riding affects her differently from what it does me. Everyone who sees me compliments me as being the best able to endure the journey over the mountains from my looks. Sister S. is very resolute, no shrinking with her. She possess good fortitude. I like her very much. She wears well upon acquaintance. She is a very suitable person for Mr. Spaulding, has the right temperment to match him. I think we shall get along very well together; we have so far. I have such a good place to shelter, under my husband's wings. He is so excellent. I love to confide in his judgment and act under him. He is just like Mother in telling me my failings. He does it in such a way that I like to have him, for it gives me a chance to improve. Jane if you want to be happy, get a good husband as I have got and be a missionary.
</p><p>
Mary, I wish you were with us. You would be happy as I am. The way looks pleasant notwithstanding we are so near encountering the difficulties of an unheard of journey for females. I think it would do your health good as well as Lyman and Brother J.G. too.
</p><p>
This letter is free plunder Jane. I will write to you again but on reflecting what I say to one I say to all. I should like to write to each of you separately but I wish to write so many ways that all my time is so occupied that I cannot write as much as I want to. Since have been here [I] we have made our tent. It is made of bed ticking in conical form, large enough for us all to sleep under, viz Mr. Spaulding and wife, Dr. Whitman and wife, Mr. Gray, Richard Takahtoo-ah-tis, and John Aits -- quite a little family, raised with a center pole and fasten down with pegs, covering a large circle. There we shall live, eat and sleep for the summer to come at least, perhaps longer. Mary, you inquired concerning my beds and beding. I will tell you. We five spread our Indian Rubber cloth on the ground, then our blankets and encamp for the night. We take plenty of Mackanaw blankets which answers for our bed and beding when we journey place them over our saddles and ride on them. I wish you could see our outfit.
</p><p>
I had made for me in Rushville a pair of Gentleman's boots in Brother Augustus shoe store and from there supplied ourselves with what shoes we wanted. We have each of us a life preserver so that if we fall into the water we shall not drown. They are made of India Rubber cloth, air tight and when filled with air and placed under the arms will prevent us from sinking. We take each of us a plate, knife and fork and a tin cup. Mary, when we are under way, I will describe the whole process to you. When I see it before my eyes & can
give a better description, for I shall have a better understanding. Husband has got me an excelent side saddle and a very easy horse. He made me a present of a mule to ride the other day, so I do not know which I shall like best. I have not tried the latter. Richard says, "Thats very bad mule, can't catch Buffaloe!" That is the test with him; their speed makes them good in his eye. I shall write you from Council Bluffs and every opportunity, especially when Mr. Parker returns. We have lately received a letter from Mrs. Parker. O what a spirit it breathes. When we were there, she said if we could not get a minister to go with us, we might keep Mr. Parker untill one came, if we would only go on and even now she has given permission for him to stay a year longer and visit another tribe to the south. I wish I could show you her letter.
</p><p>
You say Brother J.G. has been to Ithaca and wife. Why did he not go when I was there. . . He sent me the Missionary's Farewell by Dr. Satterlee, music by himself. Alas! my Husband dont come to night, the wind has blown so hard that I expect he has not been able to cross the river. Brother Gray is with him. I shall not feel so anxious about him on that account, so adieu for tonight. It is most ten o'clock and the families have all gone to rest.
</p><p>
I should like to tell you how the western people talk if I had room. Their language is so singular that I could scarcely understand them, yet very amusing. In speaking of quantity they say "heap of money, heap of water, she is heap sick, &c" "How does your wife do to day?" "O she is smartly better, I reckon, but she is powerful weak. She has been mighty bad. What's the matter with your eye?"
