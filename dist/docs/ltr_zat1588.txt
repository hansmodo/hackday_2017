HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF OCCUPATION OR INVASION,

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>, Mexico, November 9, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1846">1846</a>. 
<p></p>
MY DEAR ******* : Your very kind and acceptable letter of the 31st August, 
******** reached me only a short time since, for which I beg leave to tender you 
my sincere thanks. [A few confidential remarks on certain public transactions are 
here omitted.] 
<p></p>
After considerable apparent delay on the part of the Quartermasters Department, in 
getting steamboats into the Rio Grande adapted to its navigation, I succeeded, towards 
the latter part of August, in throwing forward to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a> (a town situated on the San 
Juan river, three miles from its junction with the Rio Grande, on the west side, nearly 
500 miles from Brasos Island by water, and 200 by land, and 140 from this place) a considerable depot of provisions, ordnance, ammunition, and forage, and then, having brought 
together an important portion of my command, I determined on moving on this place. 
Accordingly, after collecting 1,700 pack mules, with their attendants and conductors, in 
the enemy's country, (the principal means of transportation for our provisions, baggage, 
&c.,) I left, on the 5th of September, to join my advnnce, which had preceded me a few 
days to Seralvo, a small village 75 miles on the route, which I did on the 9th, and, after 
waiting there a few days for some of the corps to get up, moved on and reached here on 
the 19th, with 6,250 men 2,700 regulars, the balance volunteers. For what took place 
afterwards, I must refer you to my several reports particularly to my detailed one of the 
9th ultimo. 
<p></p>
I do not believe the authorities at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a> are at all satisfied with my conduct in 
regard to the terms of the capitulation entered into with the Mexican commander, which 
you no doubt have seen, as they have been made public through the official organ, and 
copied into various other newspapers. I have this moment recieved an answer (to my despatch an 
nouncing the surrender of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>, and the circumstances attending the same) from the Secretary 
of War, stating that " it was regretted by the President that it was not deemed advisable to insist 
on the terms I had proposed in my first communication to the Mexican commander in regard to giving 
up the city," adding that " the circumstances which dictated, no doubt justified the change." Although the terms of capitulation may be considered too liberal on our part by the President and his 
advisers, as well as by many others at a distance, particularly by those who do not understand the 
...position which we occupied, (otherwise they might come to a different conclusion in regard to the 
matter,) yet, on due reflection, I see nothing to induce me to regret the course I pursued. The proposition on the part of General Ampudia, which had much to do in determining my course in the 
matter, was based on the ground that our Government had proposed to his to settle the existing difficulties by negotiation, (which I knew was the case without knowing the result,) which was then 
under consideration by the proper authorities, and which he (General Ampudia) had no doubt would 
result favorably, as the whole of his people were in favor of peace. If so, I considered the further 
effusion of blood not only unnecessary but improper. Their force was also considerably larger than, 
ours, and, from the size and position of the place, we could not completely invest it ; so that the 
greater portion of their troops, if not the whole, had they been disposed to do so, could any night have 
abandoned the city, at once entered the mountain passes, and effected their retreat, do what we 
~could. Had we been put to the alternative of taking the place by storm, (which there is no doubt we 
should have succeeded in doing,) we should in all probability have lost fifty or a hundred men in killed, 
besides the wounded, which I wished to avoid, as there appeared to be a prospect of peace, even if a 
distant one. I also wished to avoid the destruction of women and children, which must have been 
very great had the storming process been resorted to. Besides, they had a very large and strong for 
tification a short distance from the city, which, if carried with the bayonet, must have been taken at 
great sacrifice of life, and, with our limited train of heavy or battering artillery, it would have required twenty or twenty-five days to take it by regular approaches. 
<p></p>
That they should have surrendered a place nearly as strong as Quebec, well fortified under the direction of skilful engineers their works garnished with forty-two pieces of artillery, abundantly 
supplied with ammunition, garrisoned with 7,000 regular and 2,000 irregular troops, in addition to 
some thousand citizens capable of (and no doubt actually) bearing arms, and aiding in its defence 
to an opposing force of half their number, scantily supplied with provisions, and with a light train of 
artillery, is among the unaccountable occurrences of the times. 
<p></p>
I am decidedly opposed to carrying the war beyond <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a> in this direction, which place has been 
entirely abandoned by the Mexican forces, all of whom have been concentrated at San Luis Potogi
and I shall lose no time in taking possession of the former as soon as the cessation of hostilities re 
ferred to expires which I have notified the Mexican authorities will be the case on the 13th instant, 
by direction of the President of the United States. 
<p></p>
If we are (in the language of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">Mr. Polk</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Scott</a>) under the necessity of " conquering 
a peace," and that by taking the capital of the country, we must go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a>, take that place, 
and then march on to the city of Mexico. To do so in any other direction I consider out of the 
question. But, admitting that we conquer a peace by doing so say at the end of the next twelve 
months will the amount of blood and treasure that must be expended in doing so be compensated 
by the same ? I think not especially if the country we subdue is to be given up ; and I imagine there are but few individuals in our country who think of annexing Mexico to the United States. 
<p></p>
I do not intend to carry on my operations (as previously stated) beyond <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a>, deeming it next 
to impracticable to do so. It then becomes a question as to what is best to be done. It seems to 
me that the' most judicious course to be pursued on our part would be to take possession at once of 
the line we would accept by negotiation, extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific, and occupy the same, or keep what we already have possession of; and that, with Tampeco, (which I hope 
to take in the course of the next month, or as soon as I can get the means of transportotion,) will 
give us all on this side of the Sierra Madre, and, as soon as I occupy <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a>, will include six or 
seven States as Provinces, thus holding Tampico, Victoria, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a>, Monclova, Chihuahua, 
(which I presume General Wool has possession of by this time,) Santa Fe, and the Californias, and 
say to Mexico," Drive us from the country" throwing on her the responsibility and expense of 
carrying on offensive war ; at the same time closely blockading all her ports on the Pacific and the 
Gulf. A course of this kind, if persevered in for a short time, would soon bring her to her proper 
senses, and compel her to sue for peace, provided there is a Government in the country sufficiently 
stable for us to treat with, which I fear will hardly be the case for many years to come. Without 
large reinforcements cf volunteers from the United States say ten or fifteen thousand, (those previously sent out having already been greatly reduced by sickness and other casualties,) I do not believe it 
would be advisable to march beyond <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a>, which is more than two hundred miles beyond our depots on the Rio Grande a very long line on which to keep up supplies, (over a land route in a country like this,) for a large force, and certain to be attended with an expense which will be frightful to 
Contemplate when closely looked into. 
<p></p>
From <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a> to San Louis Potosi, the next place of importance on the road to the city of Mexico, 
is three hundred miles ; one hundred and forty badly watered, where no supplies of any kind could 
be procured for men or horses. I have informed the War Department that 20,000 efficient men 
would be neeessary to ensure success if we move on that place, (a city containing a population of 
60,000. where the enemy could bring together and sustain, besides the citizens, an army of 50,000,) 
a force which. I apprehend, will hardly be collected by us, with the train necessary to feed it, as well 
as to transport various other supplies, particularly ordnance and munitions of war. 
<p></p>
In regard to the armistice, which would have expired by limitation in a few days, we lost nothing 
by it, as we could not move even now, had the enemy continued to occupy <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a> ; for, strange to 
say, the first wagon which has reached me since the declaration of war was on the 2d instant, the 
same day on which I received from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a> an ackdowledgment of my despatch announcing 
the taking of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> ; and then I received only one hundred and thirty-five; so that I have been, 
since May last, completely crippled, and am still so, for want of transportation. After raking and 
scraping the country for miles around <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a>, collecting every pack-mule and other means of 
transportation, I could bring here only 80,000 rations, (fifteen day's supply,) with a moderate supply 
of ordnance, ammunition, &.C., to do which all the corps had to leave behind a portion of their camp 
equipage necessary for their comfort; and, in some instances among the volunteers, their personal 
baggage. I moved in such a way, and with such limited means that, had I not succeeded, I 
should no doubt have been severely reprimanded, if nothing worse. I did so to sustain the Administration. * * * * 
<p></p>
Of the two regiments of mounted men from Tennessee and Kentucky, who left their respective 
States to join me in June, the latter has just reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a> ; the former had not got to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a> at the latest dates from there. Admitting that they will be as long in returning as in getting 
ijjere, (to say nothing of the time necessary to recruit their horses,) and were to be discharged in 
time to reach their homes, they could serve in Mexico but a very short time. 
<p></p>
The foregoing remarks are not made with the view of finding fault with any one, but to point out 
the difficulties with which I have had to contend. 
<p></p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>, the capital of New Leon, is situated on the San Juan river, where it comes out of the 
mountains the city (which contains a population of about twelve thousand) being in part surrounded by them at the head of a large and beautiful valley. The houses are of stone, in the Moorish 
style, with flat roofs, which, with their strongly enclosed yards and gardens in high stone walls, all 
looped for musketry, make them each a fortress within itself. It is the most important place in 
Northern Mexico, (or on the east side of Sierra Madre,) csmmanding the only pass or road for carriages from this side, between it and the Gulf of Mexico, to the table-lands of the Sierra, by or 
through which the city of Mexico can be reached. 
<p></p>
I much fear I shall have exhausted your patience before you get half through this long and uninteresting letter. If so, you can only commit it to the flames, and think no more about it, as I write 
in great haste, besides being interrupted every five minutes ; so that you must make great allowances for blots, interliniations, and blunders, as well as want of connexion in many parts of the same. 
Be so good as to present me most kindly to your excellent lady, and accept my sincere wishes for 
your good health, prosperity, and fame. 
<p></p>
I remain, truly and sincerely, 
<p></p>
your friend, 
<p></p>
