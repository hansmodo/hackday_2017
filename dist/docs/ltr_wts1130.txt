Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
I am still here at the Barracks doing my best to organize, 
equip, and prepare regiments for the coming Spring. . . . 
</p><p>
I believe an attempt will be made on the Forts on the 
Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers in co-operation with 
Buell who finds with his 120,000 men he still needs help. 
I rather think they will come up to my figures yet. 
Halleck is expected to send them from 30,000 to 50,000 
men. Had this been done early and promptly, the Confederates could not have made Bowling Green and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbia" rel="city">Columbia</a> next to impregnable. Until these places are 
reduced it will not do to advance far into Tennessee and 
I doubt if it will be done. East Tennessee cannot exercise much influence on the final result. West Tennessee 
is more important, as without the navigation of the Mississippi all commercial interests will lean to the Southern 
cause. If the Southern Confederacy can control the 
navigation of the lower Mississippi, and European nations 
from the mouths of the Mississippi, what can Missouri 
and Kentucky do ? These are, however, questions for the 
future. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately,
