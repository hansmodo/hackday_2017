Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It was not until within a week that I received your 
friendly letter of the 7th November last. It expresses sentiments of esteem and regard which, being mutual, excite 
agreeable recollections and emotions. 
</p><p>
" War in Disguise," of which you was so good as to 
enclose a copy, has given occasion to uneasiness relative to 
the matter and design of it. It contains marks of ability, 
but the author has not been entirely circumspect. I enclose 
an answer to it, written, as is supposed, and as I believe, 
by a gentleman of excellent talents and good dispositions.* [* Gouvemeur Morris.]
</p><p>
It appears to me, that every independent state has, as 
such, a perfect right at all times, whether at war or at 
peace, to make grants to and treaties with any other independent state ; but then those acts, in order to be valid, 
must consist with justice, and be in no respect fraudulent. 
To the validity of such grants and treaties, no third power, 
whether belligerent or neutral, can, in my opinion, have 
reasonable cause to object. 
</p><p>
When such acts are fraudulent, and injurious to others, 
those others are justifiable in regarding them as being 
what they are (that is, fraudulent), and in acting accordingly. When such acts are just and fair, but abused to the 
injury of others, those others have a right to complain of 
and to attack the abuse, but not the thing abused. 
</p><p>
Whether this or that particular act (of the description 
alluded to) be fair or fraudulent, is a question to be decided 
by evidence internal and external, according to the rules 
and maxims of the laws of nations relative to such cases. 
</p><p>
Believing these principles to be well founded, they do 
not permit me to adopt some of the opinions of this ingenious 
writer, nor to approve of all the latitude contended for by 
some of his opponents. To view in their various lights 
and relations, and to examine properly all the doctrines and 
positions in question, cannot be done within the compass of 
a letter. 
</p><p>
Your disposition and desire to promote good- will between 
our two countries exactly accord with my own. It is to 
be wished that each of them may ever be mindful, that the 
preservation of friendship between nations, as between individuals, requires justice and prudence always, and even forbearance sometimes ; for states, as well as persons, commit 
errors. It is our lot to live in perplexing and eventful 
times. The passions of men are not good counsellors, and 
never less so than when agitated and inflamed. 
</p><p>
We have seen concluded, with the treaty of Amiens, the 
first act of the astonishing tragedy which the French revolution has introduced on the theatre of the world. The 
present and succeeding acts will probably be highly interesting and impressive. In this prodigious drama, Great 
Britain still sustains a conspicuous and important part : 
perhaps she may be employed to restrain the " remainder of 
wrath." Whether this distant nation is to appear among 
the dramatis persona;, cannot now be known. We certainly do not desire it. 
</p><p>
The inconveniences apprehended from the death of Mr. Pitt will doubtless be diminished, if not obviated, by the 
general confidence reposed in your new administration. I 
am glad to find that <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a> holds a distinguished 
place in it. My respect and esteem for him continue undiminished. 
</p><p>
Very sincerely do I congratulate you on your domestic 
felicity. May it continue and increase. I thank you for 
what you have briefly remarked on that topic ; for you 
have given me pleasure, by letting me see how much reason you have to be pleased. 
</p><p>
With true esteem and regard, I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your faithful and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>.

P. S. As your letter was so long on the way, this answer 
will arrive, if it arrives at all, much later than you expected. 
Being anxious to remove appearances of inattention, I shall 
send a duplicate by another vessel. There will then be a 
double chance of its coming to your hands.
