My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I was exceedingly chagrined that public business 
prevented my writing to you from the field of battle, 
when the General sent his dispatches to Congress. 
The delay, however, will be attended with this advantage, that I shall be better able to give you an account 
of the enemy's loss ; tho I must now content myself 
with a very succinct relation of this affair. The 
situation of the two armies on Sunday was as follows : 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>Gen'l Washington</a>, with the main body of our army, 
was at 4 miles distance from English Town. Gen'l Lee, with a chosen advanced corps, was at that town. 
The enemy were retreating down the road which 
leads to Middle Town ; their flying army composed (as it was said), of 2 batallions of British grenadiers, 
1 Hessian grend'rs , 1 batallion of light infantry, 1 regiment of guards, 2 brigades of foot, 1 regt of dragoons 
and a number of mounted and dismounted Jagers. 
The enemy's rear was preparing to leave Monmouth 
village, which is 6 miles from this place, when our 
advanced corps was marching towards them. The 
militia of the country kept up a random running fire 
with the Hessian Jagers ; no mischief was done on 
either side. I was with a small party of horse, reconnoitering the enemy, in an open space before Mon 
mouth, when I perceived two parties of the enemy 
advancing by files in the woods on our right and left, 
with a view, as I imagined, of enveloping our small 
party, or preparing a way for a skirmish of their horse. 
I immediately wrote an account of what I had seen to 
the General, and expressed my anxiety on account of 
the languid appearance of the Continental troops 
under Gen'l Lee. 
</p><p>
Some person in the mean time reported to Gen'l Lee that the enemy were advancing upon us in two 
columns, and I was informed that he had, in consequence, ordered Varnum's brigade, which was in front, 
to repass a bridge which it had passed. I went my 
self, and assured him of the real state of the case ; his 
reply to me was, that his accounts had been so contradictory, that he was utterly at a loss what part to 
take. I repeated my account to him in positive distinct terms, and returned to make farther discoveries. 
I found that the two parties had been withdrawn 
from the wood, and that the enemy were preparing 
to leave Monmouth. I wrote a second time to <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>Gen'l Washington</a>. Gen'l Lee at length gave orders to 
advance. The enemy were forming themselves on 
the Middle Town road, with their light infantry in 
front, and cavalry on the left flank, while a scattering, 
distant fire was commenced between our flanking 
parties and theirs. I was impatient and uneasy at 
seeing that no disposition was made, and endeavoured 
to find out Gen'l Lee to inform him of what was doing, 
and know what was his disposition. He told me that 
he was going to order some troops to march below 
the enemy and cut oft their retreat. Two pieces of 
artillery were posted on our right without a single 
foot soldier to support them. Our men were formed 
piecemeal in front of the enemy, and there appeared 
to be no general plan or disposition calculated on that 
of the enemy ; the nature of the ground, or any of the 
other principles which generally govern in these cases. 
The enemy began a cannonade from two parts of 
their line ; their whole body of horse made a furious 
charge upon a small party of our cavalry and dissipated them, and drove them till the appearance of 
our infantry, and a judicious discharge or two of 
artillery made them retire precipitately. Three regiments of ours that had advanced in a plain open 
country towards the enemy's left flank, were ordered 
by Gen'l Lee to retire and occupy the village of Monmouth. They were no sooner formed there, than 
they were ordered to quit that post and gain the 
woods. One order succeeded another with a rapidity 
and indecision calculated to ruin us. The enemy 
had changed their front and were advancing in full 
march towards us ; our men were fatigued with the 
excessive heat. The artillery horses were not in 
condition to make a brisk retreat. A new position 
was ordered, but not generally communicated, for 
part of the troops were forming on the right of the 
ground, while others were marching away, and all 
the artillery driving off. The enemy, after a short 
halt, resumed their pursuit ; no cannon was left to 
check their progress. A regiment was ordered to 
form behind a fence, and as speedily commanded to 
retire. All this disgraceful retreating, passed without 
the firing of a musket, over ground which might have 
been disputed inch by inch. We passed a defile and 
arrived at an eminence beyond, which was defended 
on one hand by an impracticable fen, on the other by 
thick woods where our men would have fought to 
advantage. Here, fortunately for the honour of the 
army, and the welfare of America, <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>Gen'l Washington</a> 
met the troops retreating in disorder, and without any 
plan to make an opposition. He ordered some pieces 
of artillery to be brought up to defend the pass, and 
some troops to form and defend the pieces. The 
artillery was too distant to be brought up readily, so 
that there was but little opposition given here. A few 
shot though, and a little skirmishing in the wood 
checked the enemy's career. The Gen'l expressed his 
astonishment at this unaccountable retreat. Mr Lee 
indecently replied that the attack was contrary to his 
advice and opinion in council. We were obliged to 
retire to a position, which, though hastily reconnoitered, proved an excellent one. Two regiments were 
formed behind a fence in front of the position. The 
enemy's horse advanced in full charge with admirable 
bravery to the distance of forty paces, when a General discharge from these two regiments did great execution among them, and made them fly with the greatest precipitation. The grenadiers succeeded to the 
attack. At this time my horse was killed under me. 
In this spot the action was hottest, and there was 
considerable slaughter of British grenadiers. The 
General ordered Woodford's brigade with some artillery to take possession of an eminence on the enemy's 
left, and cannonade from thence. This produced an 
excellent effect. The enemy were prevented from 
advancing on us, and confined themselves to cannonade with a show of turning our left flank. Our 
artillery answered theirs with the greatest vigour. 
The General seeing that our left flank was secure, as 
the ground was open and commanded by it, so that 
the enemy could not attempt to turn it without exposing their own flank to a heavy fire from our artillery, 
and causing to pass in review before us, the force 
employed for turning us. In the mean time, Gen'l Lee continued retreating. <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron Steuben</a> was order'd to 
form the broken troops in the rear. The cannonade 
was incessant and the General ordered parties to 
advance from time to time and engage the British 
grenadiers and guards. The horse shewed themselves 
no more. The grenadiers showed their backs and 
retreated every where with precipitation. They re 
turned, however, again to the charge, and were again 
repulsed. They finally retreated and got over the 
strong pass, where, as I mentioned before, Gen'l "Washington first rallied the troops. We advanced 
in force and continued masters of the ground; the 
standards of liberty were planted in triumph on the 
field of battle. We remained looking at each other, 
with the defile between us, till dark, and they stole 
off in silence at midnight. We have buried of the 
enemy's slain, 233, principally grenadiers; forty odd 
of their wounded whom they left at Monmouth, fell 
into our hands. Several officers are our prisoners. 
Among their killed are Col. Moncton, a captain of the 
guards, and several captains of grenadiers. We have 
taken but a very inconsiderable number of prisoners, 
for want of a good body of horse. Deserters are 
coming in as usual. Our officers and men behaved 
with that bravery which becomes freemen, and have 
convinced the world that they can beat British grenadiers. To name any one in particular w'd be a kind 
of injustice to the rest. There are some, however, who came more immediately under my view, whom 
I will mention that you may know them. B. <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>Gen'l Wayne</a>, Col. Barber, Col. Stewart, Col. Livingston, 
Col. Oswald of the artillery, Capt. Doughty deserve well of their country, and distinguished themselves nobly. 
</p><p>
The enemy buried many of their dead that are not 
accounted for above, and carried off a great number 
of wounded. I have written diffusely, and yet I have 
not told you all. Gen'l Lee, I think, must be tried 
for misconduct. However, as this is a matter not 
generally known, tho it seems almost universally 
wished for, I would beg you, my dear father, to say 
nothing of it. 
</p><p>
You will oblige me much by excusing me to Mr Drayton for not writing to him. I congratulate you, 
my dear father, upon this seasonable victory, and am 
ever 
</p><p>
Your most dutiful and affectionate 
</p><p>

We have no returns of our loss as yet. The pro 
portion on the field of battle appeared but small. We 
have many good officers wounded.
