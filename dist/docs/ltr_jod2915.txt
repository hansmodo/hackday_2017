ENCLOSED with this you will have an Evening Post 
containing some of the tender mercies of the barbarians to their prisoners. If there is a man, woman or 
child in America who can read these depositions 
without resentment and horror, that person has no 
soul, or a very wicked one. Their treatment of prisoners last year, added to an act of Parliament, which 
they have made, to enable them to send prisoners to 
England, to be there murdered with still more relent 
less cruelty in prisons, will bring our officers and soldiers to the universal resolution to conquer or die. 
This maxim u CONQUEROR DIE " never failed to raise a people who adopted it to the head of mankind. An 
express from Portsmouth, last night, brought us news of the arrival of arms and ordnance enough to enable us to take vengeance of these foes of human nature.
