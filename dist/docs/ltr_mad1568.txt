DEAR Sir, No definitive steps are yet taken for the transportation of your furniture. I fear we shall be obliged to make 
use of a conveyance to Norfolk as soon as one shall offer. I 
have examined the workmanship of the man in Chappel street. 
The face of it is certainly superior to that of your workman. 
Whether it may prove much so for substantial purposes, I do not 
undertake to say. Should Mrs. Monroe not be pleased with the 
articles, I would recommend that you dispose of them, which 
may be done, probably, without loss, and send us a commission 
to replace them. I think we could please you both, and on terms 
not dearer than that of your purchase. We learn nothing yet 
of a remittance from S. Carolina. 
</p><p>
The business of the Mississippi will, I think, come to a point 
in a few days. You shall know the result in due time.

A motion was lately made to remove shortly to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>; 
six States would have been for it. Rhode Island was so at first, 
and would have been a seventh. One of the delegation was 
overpowered by exertions of his Eastern brethren. I need not 
rehearse to you the considerations which operated on both sides. 
Your conjectures will not mistake them. My own opinion is, 
that there are strong objections against the moment, [movement?] objections which nothing would supersede but the dim"culty of bringing the sense of the Union to an efficient vote 
in Congress, and the danger of losing altogether a proper 
measure by waiting for a proper time. A middle way would 
have been my choice; that is, to fix <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> for the meeting of the ensuing Congress, and to remain here in the mean 
time. This would have given time for all preliminary arrangements, would have steered clear of the Convention, and, by selecting a natural period for the event, and transferring the 
operation of it to our successors in office, all insinuations of 
suddenness, and of personal views, would have been repelled. 
</p><p>
I hear with great pleasure that you are to aid the deliberations of the next Assembly, and with much concern that paper 
money will probably be among the bad measures which you will 
have to battle. Wishing you success in this and all your other 
labours for the public and for yourself, I remain, with best respects to Mrs. Monroe, 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately.
