DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Ever since your letter to the President, of December last, I have had a great inclination to address a 
letter to Mr. Vanderkemp ; and, being now confined 
to my chamber, by an attack of the rheumatism, I 
find a leisure hour to address my friend in his solitude. 
</p><p>
And in the first place, to put him perfectly at his 
ease, I assure him that I make not any pretensions 
to the character of a learned lady, and therefore, 
according to his creed, I am entitled to his benevolence. I can say with Gay's hermit, 
</p><p>
" The little knowledge I have o-ained. 
Is all from simple nature drained." 
</p><p>
I agree with Mr. Vanderkemp, that, in declaring 
his opinion, he has expressed that of most gentlemen, the true cause of which I shall trace no farther 
than that they consider a companion more desirable 
than a rival. In reading the life of Madame de Stael, I learn that it was her superior talents and learning, 
perhaps too ostentatiously displayed, which produced 
that coldness, estrangement, and unhappiness, which 
marred all her pleasure with the Baron de Stael, 
soured every domestic enjoyment, and was the 
occasion of that sarcastic question to her by the 
Emperor Bonaparte. Upon some occasion, she had 
solicited an interview with him, and recommended 
to him some measure for him to pursue. He heard 
her, but made her no other reply than this ; " Madam, who educates your children ? " 
</p><p>
I like your portrait of female excellence. Solomon has also drawn one in the character of a virtuous woman ; but, if a sound understanding had not 
been united with virtuous habits and principles, is it 
probable that he would have represented the heart of 
her husband as safely trusting in her ? or that he 
would have derived so much lustre from her character, as to be known in the gates, when he sat with 
the elders of the land ? It is very certain, that a 
well-informed woman, conscious of her nature and 
dignity, is more capable of performing the relative 
duties of life, and of ena-agins; and retaining; the 
affections of a man of understanding, than one whose 
intellectual endowments rise not above the common 
level. 
</p><p>
There are so few women who may be really 
called learned, that I do not wonder they are considered as black swans. It requires such talents and 
such devotion of time and study, as to exclude the 
performance of most of the domestic cares and duties which exclusively fall to the lot of most females 
in this country. I believe nature has assigned to each 
sex their particular duties and sphere of action, and 
to act well their part, " there all the honor lies." 
</p><p>
Have you seen John Randolph's letter, and Mr. 
Lloyd's reply ? 
</p><p>
Present me in friendly terms to Mrs. Vanderkemp. Tell her, I wish we were neighbours. I 
should then have a pleasure which our residence in 
the country deprives us of, that of the society and 
converse of a gentleman of taste, science, and extensive information ; and, although much of his 
learning might be above my comprehension, his benevolence, politeness, and urbanity would render it 
grateful, and be in unison with the good-will and 
friendship entertained for him by 
</p><p>
Aeigail Adams.
