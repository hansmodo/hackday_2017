<a rel='month origin' value='12'>December</a> <a rel='day origin' value='21'>21st</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city origin'>CHARLESTON</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1860' rel="origin">1860</a>]. Mrs. Charles Lowndes was sitting with us to-day, when Mrs. Kirkland brought in a copy of the 
Secession Ordinance. I wonder if my face grew as white as hers. She said after a moment : "God help us. As our 
day, so shall our strength be." How grateful we were for this pious ejaculation of hers ! They say I had better take 
my last look at this beautiful place, Combahee. It is on the coast, open to gunboats.

We mean business this time, because of this convocation of the notables, this convention. In it are all our wisest 
and best. They really have tried to send the ablest men, the good men and true. South Carolina was never more 
splendidly represented. Patriotism aside, it makes society delightful. One need not regret having left Washington.
