<a rel='month origin' value='5'>May</a> <a rel='day origin' value='18'>18th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. Norfolk has been burned and the Merrimac 
sunk without striking a blow since her coup d etat in Hampton Roads. Read Milton. See the speech of Adam to Eve 
in a new light. Women will not stay at home ; will go out to see and be seen, even if it be by the devil himself.

Very encouraging letters from Hon. Mr. Memminger and from L. Q. Washington. They tell the same story in 
very different words. It amounts to this: " Not one foot of Virginia soil is to be given up without a bitter fight for 
it. We have one hundred and five thousand men in all, <a href='/results.php?tla=gbm' rel=''>McClellan</a> one hundred and ninety thousand. We can 
stand that disparity.

What things I have been said to have said! Mr. heard me make scoffing remarks about the Governor and the 
Council or he thinks he heard me. James Chesnut wrote him a note that my name was to be kept out of it indeed, 
that he was never to mention my name again under any possible circumstances. It was all preposterous nonsense, but it 
annoyed my husband amazingly. He said it was a scheme to use my chatter to his injury. He was very kind about it. 
He knows my real style so well that he can always tell my real impudence from what is fabricated for me.

There is said to be an order from Butler turning over the women of New Orleans to his soldiers. Thus is the 
measure of his iniquities filled. We thought that generals 
always restrained, by shot or sword if need be, the brutality of soldiers. This hideous, cross-eyed beast orders his 
men to treat the ladies of New Orleans as women of the town to punish them, he says, for their insolence.

Footprints on the boundaries of another world once more. Willie Taylor, before he left home for the army, 
fancied one day day, remember that he saw Albert Rhett standing by his side. He recoiled from the ghostly 
presence. " You need not do that, Willie. You will soon be as I am. Willie rushed into the next room to tell them 
what had happened, and fainted. It had a very depressing effect upon him. And now the other day he died in Virginia.
