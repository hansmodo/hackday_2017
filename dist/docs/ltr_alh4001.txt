Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Though I have not performed my promise of writing to 
you, which I made you when you left this country, yet I 
have not the less interested myself in your welfare and 
success. I have been witness with pleasure to every event 
which has had a tendency to advance you in the esteem of 
your country ; and I may assure you with sincerity that it 
is as high as you could possibly wish. All have united in 
the warmest approbation of your conduct. I cannot 
forbear telling you this, because my situation has given 
me access to the truth, and I gratify my friendship for you 
in communicating what cannot fail to gratify your sensibility. 
</p><p>
The peace, which exceeds in the goodness of its terms 
the expectations of the most sanguine, does the highest 
honour to those who made it. It is the more agreeable as 
the time was come when thinking men began to be seriously 
alarmed at the internal embarrassments and exhausted stair 
of this country. The New-England people talk of making 
you an animal fish-offering, as an acknowledgment of your 
exertions for the participation of the fisheries. 
</p><p>
We have now happily concluded the greal work of 
independence, but much remains to he done to reap the 
fruits of it. Our prospects are not fla Everyday proves the inefficacy of the present leration, ; el the common danger being removed, we are receding instead 
of advancing in a disposition to amend its defects. The 
road to popularity in each State is to inspire jealousies of 
the power of Congress, though nothing can be more apparent than that they have no power ; and that for the want 
of it, the resources of the country during the war could 
not be drawn out, and we at this moment experience all 
the mischiefs of a bankrupt and ruined credit. It is to be 
hoped that when prejudice and folly have run themselves 
out of breath, we may return to reason and correct our errors. 
</p><p>
After having served in the field during the war, I have 
been making a short apprenticeship in Congress ; but the 
evacuation of New-York approaching, I am preparing to 
take leave of public life, to enter into the practice of the 
law. Your country will continue to demand your services 
abroad. I beg you to present me most respectfully to Mrs. 
Jay, and to be assured of the affection and esteem of, 
</p><p>
Dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant,
