UNITED STATES SENATE CHAMBER, 
</p><p>
Feb. 23, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1868">1868</a>.

Dear Brother : I received your letters and telegrams, 
and did not answer because events were moving so rapidly that I could say nothing but might be upset before 
you got the letter. 
</p><p>
Now you can congratulate yourself upon being clear of 
the worst complications we have ever had. Impeachment 
seems to be a foregone conclusion so far as the House 
of Representatives is concerned, based upon the alleged 
forcible expulsion of Stanton. No one disputes the right, 
of the President to raise a question of law upon his right 
to remove Stanton, but the forcible removal of a man in 
office, claiming to be in lawfully, is like the forcible 
ejectment of a tenant when his right of possession is in 
dispute. It is a trespass, an assault, a riot, or a crime, 
according to the result of the force. It is strange the 
President can contemplate such a thing, when Stanton 
is already stripped of power, and the courts are open to 
the President to try his right of removal. The President is acting very badly with respect to you. He 
creates the impression that you acted disingenuously 
with him. He has published your short private note 
before you went to Annapolis, and yet refuses to publish 
your formal one subsequently sent him, because it was 
"private." The truth is, he is a slave to his passions 
and resentments. No man can confide in him, and you 
ought to feel happy at your extrication from all near 
connection with him. . . . Grant is anxious to have 
your letters published, since the note referred to was 
published. I will see Grant and the President this 
evening, and if the latter freely consents, I will do it 
informally ; but if he doubts or hesitates, I will not without your expressed directions. In these times of loose 
confidence, it is better to submit for a time to a wrong 
construction, than to betray confidential communications. Grant will, unquestionably, be nominated. 
Chase acquiesces, and I see no reason to doubt his election. . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately,
