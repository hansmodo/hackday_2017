I was sick, very sick, but feeling better, I ate a very hearty breakfast of fresh bread, the first we have had since leaving the Capes. I was hungry at supper last night, but could not eat our mush, which had been about half boiled for breakfast and then warmed instead of fried for supper.

I am sorry we have not a clergyman on board for if it would do no other good, it would at least give us a little variety and drive the dull sameness of every day away, at least once a week. However, we have plenty of good stories told, and some talk is made of establishing a debating society. I hope it will be done. It would not only afford amusement, but also an opportunity for improvement.

We are getting along very handsomely on our course, making 4 to 6 knots per hour and 153 miles in the last 24 hours. Two vessels were in sight yesterday but they distanced us in the afternoon. Another vessel in sight this morning neared us towards noon. We hoisted our flag and she did likewise. We flew up our name and she raised hers. Presently she came within speaking distance and crossed our bows. Our Captain had stationed himself at a proper place, with his speaking trumpet, and hailed her with, "Where bound?" She answered, "California." "Where you from, pray?" "Boston." "How long out?" "Twelve dayswith fair wind." She asked us similar questions and was answered. Her name was John Parker. She then gave us three cheers and we returned six. She had
but few passengers on board. We saw two ladies on deck. It will be seen that she has made an equal distance with ourselves, but she had fair winds while we were becalmed several days, and head winds several more. This is the second vessel we have spoken.

It will be a long while before I forget that Monday is the day of all others in the week for work in the old Record office. I suppose that tomorrow my old comrades in arms will be dispatching business at a rapid rate, and perhaps my services would be acceptable for an hour or two. But I cannot be here and there, too. Their memory cannot be forgotten and I hope I will not be. But I must not allow myself to get to musing in this way, as it might lead to disastrous results, and supper will soon be ready. We will have boiled mush and molasses, salt pork, tea, coffee.
