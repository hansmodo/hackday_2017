COMMITTEE OF FINANCE,

U. S. SENATE, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, Jan. 26, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1872">1872</a>.

Dear Brother: . . . Congress is going on with its 
usual round of debate and delay. I am quite busy with 
taxes and tariff, and spend most of the time in committee. My re-election has got to be an old story. As 
the session approached, the opposition to me in my own 
party died away, and I received the unanimous vote. 
Still there were five or six Republicans who were disposed 
to enter into the new party movement, among them Howard and certain <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a> members. They disavowed 
any hostility to me, but were inclined to support Cox as 
an Anti-Grant or new departure candidate. Perhaps if 
the whole body of the Democrats had gone into this movement it might have resulted in my defeat ; but this was 
found impracticable, and so I was elected by seven majority over all. I think <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> has found out that 
my strength in Ohio was equal to his own. I was in Columbus for one week, but was not put to either unusual 
trouble or expense, and now hold the office as independent in promise as any member of the Senate. . . . You 
are to have a grand trip. Your movements are observed 
and commented upon here kindly. By all means take it 
easy and don't hurry. . . . 
</p><p>
Your affectionate brother, 
</p><p>
