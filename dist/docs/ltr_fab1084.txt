Father leaves this afternoon at five and will tell you all the news when he gets home. I am very sorry Joseph did not come with him. It seems as though he was afraid to venture any farther than Boston.

The evenings for a week past have been most delightful, excepting the heat which is most intense. You can't endure any clothing. Cravats and vests are all out of
date and the Southern dress all the fashion (viz: a shirt collar and spurs).

I went down to Arthur's farm last week with Tim Smith and got our full of cherries. He raises cartloads. Strawberries are about done. We have had them every night for a fortnight. I am glad to hear you are getting along so well down East. Father looks fat and is in good spirits. Tell Mother I am greatly obliged to her for those shirts. That was more than I expected. I supposed that they had done clothing me. However, they will be very acceptable.

I send you a book which is a pretty good story. I thought of buying some present but I am too poor to get anything worth while so you must wait until I get more salary. I think just as much of you and send it with the same feelings that I should a thousand dollars.

Tim and I went to the Park the other night to hear the beautiful opera of Norma. This is a better company than the one I heard last winter. Tedesco is the greatest singer I ever heard. This is all the place of amusement I have attended in a long time and will be the last for some time. I had been expecting a great treat ever since I heard of them in Boston and was not disappointed. To anyone that likes music this is the kind I think you would be perfectly charmed with if you could hear it.

Give my respects to Ed Kirk and tell him I should like to hear from him, yourself ditto. Sarah is already now to have you come out here and make a visit. Arthur thinks of going down East this summer. John cut his whiskers off yesterday, and I remain yours perspiringly.
