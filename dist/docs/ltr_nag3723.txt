Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since I wrote your Excellency, by Colonel Morris, 
nothing very material has taken place, except the 
hanging of Colonel Hayne, one of our militia Colonels, whom the enemy hung in <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, a little 
time since, as a traitor, as they call him. He was a 
man of a most amiable character, highly respected, 
and of a most extensive influence. This insult, offered 
to the good people of this country, and to the business of exchange, it being a most flagrant violation 
of the cartel, I am determined to retaliate ; and, as 
the enemy are indifferent about their militia officers, 
I mean to retaliate on the British officers, as the 
surest way of putting a stop to a practice that can 
only serve to gratify private revenge. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a> and Colonel Lee have taken a few 
prisoners since I wrote before, in the whole between 
twenty and thirty, three or four of whom are officers. 
The rivers have been so high, owing to the great 
rains, as has prevented parties passing them with 
sufficient ease to attempt surprises. We are endeavouring to draw a body of militia together at Friday's Ferry, and are on our march to that place to 
combine our forces, and make an attack on the enemy at McCord's Ferry, if our force will authorize the 
attempt when we are collected. 
</p><p>
I am much at a loss, what are Lord Cornwallis's 
intentions in Virginia. I have directed the Marquis 
to govern his motions by the enemy's, and to detach 
here, if they detach largely from there, and not without. I am totally ignorant of what is going on at 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, having heard nothing from your Excellency since June, which induces me to believe your 
despatches are intercepted. I pray God the expedition against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> may succeed, and prove the 
corner-stone of American independence, as it undoubtedly would. I wait with impatience for intelligence, 
by which I mean to govern my own operations. If 
things are flattering in the north, I will hazard less 
in the south ; but, if otherwise there, we must risk 
more here. With every wish for your Excellency's safety, glory, and success, I am, with great esteem 
and regard. 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
