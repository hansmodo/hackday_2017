<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>, the 19th February, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1778">1778</a>.
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>Dear General</a>,--Why am I so far from you and what business had the board
of war to hurry me through the ice and snow without knowing what I
should do, neither what they were doing themselves? You have thought,
perhaps, that their project would be attended with some difficulty,
that some means had been neglected, that I could not obtain all the
success and the immensity of laurels which they had promised to me; but
I defy your excellency to conceive any idea of what I have seen since I
left the place where I was quiet and near my friends, to run myself
through all the blunders of madness or treachery (God knows what). Let
me begin the journal of my fine and glorious campaign.
</p><p>
According to Lord Stirling's advice, I went by Corich-ferry to Ringo's
tavern, where Mr. Duer had given me a rendezvous; but there no Duer was
to be found, and they did never hear from him.
</p><p>
From thence I proceeded by the State of New York, and had the pleasure
of seeing the friends of America, as warm in their love for the
commander-in-chief as his best friend could wish. I spoke to Governor
Clinton, and was much satisfied with that gentleman. At length I met
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>, the 17th, though I was not expected before the 25th. General
Conway had been here only three days before me, and I must confess I
found him very active and looking as if he had good intentions; but we
know a great deal upon that subject. His first word has been that the
expedition is quite impossible. I was at first very diffident of this
report, but have found that he was right. Such is, at least, the idea I
can form of this ill-concerted operation within these two days.
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='co-worker'>General Schuyler</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='co-worker met'>General Lincoln</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='co-worker'>General Arnold</a>, had written, before
my arrival, to General Conway, in the most expressive terms, that, in
our present circumstances, there was no possibility to begin, now, an
enterprise into Canada. Hay, deputy quarter-master-general; Cuyler,
deputy commissary-general; Mearsin, deputy clothier-general, in what
they call the northern department, are entirely of the same opinion.
Colonel Hazen, who has been appointed to a place which interferes with
the three others above mentioned, was the most desirous of going there.
The reasons of such an order I think I may attribute to other motives.
The same Hazen confesses we are not strong enough to think of the
expedition in this moment. As to the troops, they are disgusted, and
(if you except some Hazen's Canadians) reluctant, to the utmost degree,
to begin a winter incursion in a so cold country. I have consulted
everybody, and everybody answers me that it would be madness to
undertake this operation.
</p><p>
I have been deceived by the board of war; they have, by the strongest
expressions, promised to me one thousand, and (what is more to be
depended upon) they have assured to me in writing, "two thou-sand and
five hundred combatants, at a low estimate". Now, Sir, I do not believe
I can find, "in all", twelve hundred fit for duty, and most part of
those very men are naked, even for a summer's campaign. I was to find
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhs' rel='co-worker'>General Stark</a> with a large body, and indeed <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='co-worker'>General Gates</a> had told to
me, "<a href='/results.php?tla=jhs' rel='co-worker'>General Stark</a> will have burnt the fleet before your arrival ".
Well, the first letter I receive in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a> is from <a href='/results.php?tla=jhs' rel='co-worker'>General Stark</a>, who
wishes to know "what number of men, from whence, for what time, for
what rendezvous, I desire him to raise". Colonel Biveld, who was to
rise too, would have done something "had he received money". One asks,
what encouragement his people will have, the other has no clothes; not
one of them has received a dollar of what was due to them. I have
applied to every body, I have begged at every door I could these two
days, and I see that I could do something were the expedition to be
begun in five weeks. But you know we have not an hour to lose, and
indeed it is now rather too late, had we every thing in readiness.
</p><p>
There is a spirit of dissatisfaction prevailing among the soldiers, and
even the officers, which is owing to their not being paid for some time
since. This department is much indebted, and as near as I can
ascertain, for so short a time, I have already discovered near eight
hundred thousand dollars due to the continental troops, some militia,
the quartermaster's department, &c. &c. &c. It was with four hundred
thousand dollars, only the half of which is arrived to day, that I was
to undertake the operation, and satisfy the men under my commands. I
send to congress the account of those debts. Some clothes, by Colonel Hazen's activity, are arrived from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, but not enough by far, and
the greatest part is cut off.
</p><p>
We have had intelligence from a deserter, who makes the enemy stronger
than I thought. There is no such thing "as straw on board the vessels
to burn them". I have sent to congress a full account of the matter; I
hope it will open their eyes. What they will resolve upon I do not
know, but I think I must wait here for their answer. I have inclosed to
the president, copies of the most important letters I had received. It
would be tedious for your excellency, were I to undertake the minutest
detail of everything; it will be sufficient to say that the want of
men, clothes, money, and the want of time, deprives me of all hopes as
to this excursion. If it may begin again in the month of June, by the
east, I cannot venture to assure; but for the present moment such is
the idea I conceive of the famous incursion, as far as I may be
informed, in a so short time.
</p><p>
Your excellency may judge that I am very distressed by this
disappointment. My being appointed to the command of the expedition is
known through the continent, it will be soon known in Europe, as I have
been desired, by members of congress, to write to my friends; my being
at the head of an army, people will be in great expectations, and what
shall I answer?
</p><p>
I am afraid it will reflect on my reputation, and I shall be laughed
at. My fears upon that subject are so strong, that I would choose to
become again only a volunteer, unless congress offers the means of
mending this ugly business by some glorious operation; but I am very
far from giving to them the least notice upon that matter. <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='co-worker'>General Arnold</a> seems very fond of a diversion against New York, and he is too
sick to take the field before four or five months. I should be happy if
something was proposed to me in that way, but I will never ask, nor
even seem desirous, of anything directly from congress; for you, dear
general, I know very well, that you will do everything to procure me
the only thing I am ambitious of--glory.
</p><p>
I think your excellency will approve of my staying here till further
orders, and of my taking the liberty of sending my despatches to
congress by a very quick occasion, without going through the hands of
my general; but I was desirous to acquaint them early of my
disagreeable and ridiculous situation.
</p><p>
With the greatest affection and respect, I have the honour to be, &c.
