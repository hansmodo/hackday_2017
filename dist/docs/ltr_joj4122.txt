Dear Sin, 
</p><p>
I had last week the pleasure of receiving from you a few 
lines by Mr. Blaney. You will receive this letter by the 
hands of <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Morris</a>. He will also be the bearer of my 
despatches to Mr. Randolph. They will be voluminous, 
particular, and. in many respects, interesting. It should not 
be forgotten that there is irritation here as well as in 
America, and that our party processions, toasts, rejoicings, 
&c. &c, have not been well calculated to produce goodwill and good-humour. The government, nevertheless, 
distinguish between national acts and party effusions, and 
have entertained hitherto an opinion and belief that the 
president and our government and nation in general, were 
really desirous of an amicable settlement of differences, 
and of laying a foundation for friendship as well as peace 
between the two countries. 
</p><p>
The secretary's letters by <a href='/results.php?tla=jam' rel='colleague'>Mr. Monroe</a>, and his speech 
on his introduction to the Convention, have appeared in the 
English papers. Their impression in this country may 
easily be conjectured. I wish they had both been more 
guarded. The language of the United States at Paris and 
London should correspond with their neutrality. These 
things are not favourable to my mission. A speedy conclusion to the negotiation is problematical, though not highly 
improbable. If I should be able to conclude the business 
on admissible terms, I shall do it and risk consequences, 
rather than by the delay of waiting fur and governing myself 
by opinions and instructions, hazard a change in the disposition of this court ; for it seems our country, or rather some 
part- of it, will not forbear asperities. I hear that Virginia 
is taking British property by escheat ; and other things 
which in the present moment are unseasonable, are here 
reported. 
As the proposed articles are under consideration â€” as they 
have already undergone some alterations, and as I am not 
without hopes of other and further amendments, I really 
think they ought not to be published in their present crude 
state, especially as in the course of a few weeks I expect 
to be able to communicate their ultimate form. If they 
should not appear to me to be such as I ought to sign, I 
will transmit them, and wait for further instructions. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear sir, 
</p><p>
Yours, sincerely, 
</p><p>
