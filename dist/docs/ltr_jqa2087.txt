</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I received two days ago your letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> of 
June 29. It gratified my highest ambition, as it testifies 
the approbation of the President and the Secretaries upon 
my conduct and correspondence, and my strongest affections, 
as it informed me of the health of my dearest friends. 
</p><p>
At the same time I received a letter from my brother 
Charles, and papers with accounts of popular movements 
in opposition to the treaty, which give me great anxiety. 
They were not indeed unexpected to me, because I have 
long since been satisfied that the most powerful engines of 
influence among us would be set at work upon this occasion. 
My letters from the month of May to this time will give you 
my opinions and conjectures on the subject; they are corroborated by the accounts that we now receive from America, 
and they give me great solicitude, as they renew the danger 
of war, which I had hopes was blown over for the present. 
It is a danger so much the more formidable, because I believe the intention is to draw the United States into it, 
merely to make tools of them, in order to procure advantageous terms for others, who would leave us in the well, 
after using our weight to get themselves out of it. It would 
be a war in which we should have everything to lose and 
nothing to gain ; a war commenced against the will of al 
most the whole people, and which therefore under such a 
government as ours could not be carried on with success. 
The chain of consequences which present themselves to 
my mind as inevitable from such a source can afford but a 
wretched contemplation, and my greatest hopes of a more 
favorable futurity arise from firmness and resolution of the government. 
</p><p>
The conduct of the British government is so well adapted 
to increasing our danger of war, that I cannot but suppose 
they are secretly inclined to produce it. An American can 
not know, without seeing Europe to witness the fact, with 
</p><p>
not think of retiring from the walk he is in. His prospects, if he continues in it are 
fair, and I shall be much mistaken if, in as short a period as can well be expected* 
he is not found at the head of the diplomatic corps, let the government be administered by whomsoever the people may choose." Ms. 
what pleasure and exultation all the partizans of monarchy 
receive accounts of any popular commotions in America. 
The insurrection of the last summer was a delicious feast 
for them, and they did not fail to make the most liberal use 
of it ; they will undoubtedly do the same upon this occasion. 
They are all inimical to the government of the United States, 
because it furnishes a constant example to those who maintain the superior excellence of a Republican system. They 
wish to see some proof of extravagance or folly in America, 
which they can have the pleasure of attributing to the prevalence of republicanism, as they have done very success 
fully with respect to the frenzies of France. 
</p><p>
As to the treaty itself, the objection to the condition of 
the twelfth article appears to be well grounded ; it was not 
in the plan which was shown to me when I was in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, 
and of which I wrote you from thence, and I should have 
been surprised had it been submitted to on any account 
whatever. But in every other respect it still appears to me 
as it did at that time preferable to a war. I will even add 
at present, that it is in my mind preferable to no agreement 
at all, upon the principal subjects to which it refers. But 
when people among us talk of Britain's being at her last 
gasp, and of her being totally ruined if the United States 
should fall upon her, we can but hope for the credit of the speaker, that his assertion is only unfounded and the result of ignorance. 
</p><p>
The force of Great Britain is so far from being exhausted, that her maritime power was never at any period so great 
as it is at present. Her naval superiority is everywhere so indisputably established that in the Mediterranean, on the 
ocean, in the channel, or in the North sea, a French or a Dutch armed vessel can scarce venture out of an harbor with 
out being intercepted. Scarce a week passes by without the coasts of this country's being insulted by her men of war, 
and in France there is not the smallest resistance attempted against the landing of emigrant expeditions from England, 
although one considerable corps of them has been exterminated after their descent was effected. The French frigates which during the last season were very successful 
against their British commerce have all been taken, or dare not keep the sea, and for several months past there has been 
scarce a single capture made by them, while all the ships of the Dutch East India Company are falling into the hands of 
their enemies, the helpless victims of the maritime impotence opposed against the British power. 
</p><p>
The state of their finances is equally far from being exhausted, and equally superior to those of France or of Holland. A loan of twenty-four millions sterling for the present 
year does not even diminish the price of their funds a single 
farthing. They have kept up to the present time, when 
the season is almost past, and if twenty-four millions more 
should be called for in the course of three or .four months, 
they will be found with the same facility. This profusion 
will be ruinous and destructive in its consequences I believe ; 
but for the present it gives them a mischievous strength with 
which it would not be safe to contend, and the only good 
American policy is to keep as much as possible out of its 
reach, to remain aloof while the convulsive energy is operating, and to wait for the inevitable moment of subsequent weakness. 
</p><p>
The acting Government has likewise a power within the country which meets with no control. The parliamentary 
opposition has scarcely gained a fraction since the beginning of the war ; and although there is a party in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> and in 
some other commercial towns restless and which may be come formidable, yet in general throughout the country the 
popular voice is unequivocally favorable to the ministerial system. 
</p><p>
On the other hand I am very doubtful whether the French government would be disposed to contract any engagements 
which would bind them to a common cause with us. They would give us as many fair words as we could wish, but 
would stipulate nothing without a consideration more than adequate to it. But if they should even tempt us by the 
most unlimited obligations of inseparable participation, the 
present state of their affairs is such as can inspire but little confidence in the permanency of their cooperation. They 
continue still to be victorious by land, and they may perhaps 
make advantageous treaties of peace with all the powers with 
which they are still at war, except Britain. But their internal situation is as unsettled, the parties among them are 
as numerous, as violent, and as ready to extinguish one 
another in blood as they have ever been. There is no confidence in the new Constitution by any of the parties, and 
the popular opinions are so wide from the present system of 
government, that the Convention appear to place all their 
dependance in the armies. The intention to employ them to 
the purpose of containing the people is attributed to the 
Convention, and has been in some measure acknowledged 
by some of the governing members. The tendency of their 
politics is towards a military government, but it will certainly not be firmly established without numerous struggles 
and violent convulsions. The policy pursued by all the 
European powers with whom they are now at peace is to 
live with them in a simple state of peace, but to form with 
them no engagements the validity of which would depend 
upon the permanency of the present order of things. Their 
future prospects exhibit a mere chaos of uncertainty, and 
it is not possible to form a rational opinion whether they will 
settle into any quiet and peaceable course of government, 
or whether they will continue to float alternately between 
anarchy and despotism, as the breath of their successive 
factions shall impel them. One thing alone is indubitable. 
It is that their present state will not be permanent. The 
only safe connection that can exist with them is that which 
would not be liable to follow the fate of their internal revolutions. 
</p><p>
I inclose herewith a copy of their Constitution as it has been agreed to by the Convention, and is now before the 
people and the armies for acceptance. It is presumed it 
will be adopted. You will observe that it has exploded many 
of the doctrines which but two or three years since were 
articles of political faith, that were not even susceptible of 
discussion. The sacred duty of insurrection has disappeared, 
the popular societies are constitutionally annihilated, the 
legislature is divided. The executive is invested with pomp, 
and splendor, and power, and even the heresy of checks and 
balances is very near becoming an article of orthodox creed. 
The Constitution is indeed not so absurd as the two former, 
but it will meet with the same fate. In America the great 
difficulty is to unite the people in the acceptance of a Constitution, but when once accepted it has at least some force 
and operation. In France nothing is easier than to procure the adoption of a Constitution, but this adoption is the only effect it produces. 
</p><p>
The present Convention, however, in establishing this Constitution intend to continue themselves in possession 
of the legislative power, and the primary assemblies are commanded to choose two-thirds of the members into the first 
legislature. This decree is said to be extremely unpopular, not so much because it is violating every constitutional principle by the first act with which the Constitution is to commence, as because there are said not to be two-thirds, nor a 
tenth part, of that number, among the members of the Convention who possess any of the confidence of the people. It 
is scarcely possible indeed to conceal how unpopular the 
Assembly is with all parties, and the most conspicuous members at this time are not more exempt from the public censure than the rest. 
</p><p>
Their arms have not ceased to be victorious however, and within these few days they have effected the passage of the 
Rhine, which has long been expected, and taken Diisseldorf. 
They have also recently concluded and ratified a treaty of 
peace with the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel. 
</p><p>
The state of affairs in this country is equally unsettled, 
and depends entirely upon the nature of the changes that 
may take place in France. The great object of solicitude 
here is the formation of a National Convention; as this 
measure would by the simple fact dissolve the federal union 
of their old Constitution, it meets with great opposition in 
some of the provinces. The parties have grown warm, and 
by mutual irritation will soon kindle into factions. In this 
Province the antifederal party is almost unanimous, and the 
word of federalist is rendered as odious as it has been in 
France, or as the opposite word has been in America. 
</p><p>
The present government, which has from necessity connected its fate with the success of the French, lives in constant terror of Prussia on the one side, and of Britain on the 
other. They are doomed to see their lot ascertained by the 
progress of events in which they have no participation, and 
to expect in helpless imbecility the issue which shall proscribe 
them as culprits, or fix them in their seats as the rulers of the 
land. The hundred millions of florins they are paying to 
France absorb all the supplies derived from the extreme re 
sources to which they have already recurred. They have 
made what they call a junction of their naval forces, that is 
of the squadrons of the Texel and of Zeeland ; their news 
papers say that the whole number of their armament thus 
united amounted to upwards of twenty vessels great and 
small, but I have been assured that most of them were mere 
hulks that could scarcely keep above water, and they have 
long since taken refuge in the Texel from the danger of an English fleet, which now cruises on the coast and is frequently 
seen from the shore at Schevening [Scheveningen]. 
</p><p>
A Minister Plenipotentiary from the French Republic 
has arrived here a few days since. We have hitherto 
visited only by cards, in the style of etiquette still preserved 
in their diplomacy, so that I have not seen him. The corps diplomatique here is already very much reduced. The 
Minister from Denmark is already gone, those of Portugal 
and Sweden will soon follow; they go upon various pre 
texts, but the real motive in all probability is to avoid the 
necessity of acknowledging the Convention that is impend 
ing. I shall then be the only accredited Minister remaining, 
but I have my instructions and shall therefore be at ease. 
</p><p>
They have determined here to recall Mr. Van Berckel, 
who is to be directed to take leave in the most friendly manner, giving the express assurance that his recall is owing 
solely to the intention of their High Mightinesses to send 
another person in his stead. That other person is a Mr. 
Van Polanen, a Zeeland Patriot, who is already in America, 
having some years ago found a refuge there from public oppression and private misfortune. I have seen his lady here, 
who is much esteemed ; he is also as well spoken of as the virulence of parties will admit. 
</p><p>
Mr. Van Berckel's recall I understand is owing to his having dismissed or suspended a Dutch consul, for rejoicing at 
the emancipation of this country. At least that is the reason given. But they have in general recalled all their ministers who were attached to the former government. 
</p><p>
Mr. Van Lynden, who was Ambassador at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, is now appointed to the Court of Denmark. 
</p><p>
Mr. Dumas has finally obtained from the States General a resolution for erasing from their registers that which 
was formerly passed containing a censure upon him, and the present resolution bears honorable testimony to his 
patriotism and his irreproachable conduct. He intends to send you this vindication of his integrity himself. He is now ready to say his nunc dimittis. 
</p><p>
I remain &c.
