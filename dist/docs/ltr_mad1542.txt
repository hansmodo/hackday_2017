DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 31st ult. did not come to hand 
till two days ago. As I expect to see you in a short time, I 
will suspend the full communication of my ideas on the subject 
of it till I have that pleasure. 
</p><p>
I cannot, however, forbear in the mean time expressing my 
amazement that a thought should be entertained of surrendering the Mississippi, and of guarantying the possessions of Spain 
in America. In the first place, has not Virginia, have not Congress themselves, and the Ministers of Congress by their orders, 
asserv.d the right of those who live on the waters of the Mississippi to use it as the high road given by nature to the sea ? 
This being the case, have Congress any more authority to say 
that the Western citizens of Virginia shall not pass through 
the capes of the Mississippi than to say that her Eastern citizens shall not pass through the capes Henry and Charles ? It 
should be remembered that the United States are not now extricating themselves from war a crisis which often knows no 
law but that of necessity. The measure in question would be a 
voluntary barter, in time of profound peace, of the rights of 
one part of the empire to the interests of another part. What 
would Massachusetts say to a proposition for ceding to Britain 
her right of fishery as the price of some stipulations in favor 
of Tobacco? 
</p><p>
Again : can there be a more short-sighted or dishonorable 
policy than to concur with Spain in frustrating the benevolent 
views of nature, to sell the affections of our ultra-montane 
brethren, to depreciate the richest fund we possess, to distrust 
an ally we know to be able to befriend us, and to have an interest in doing it against the only nation whose enmity we can 
dread, and at the same time to court by the most precious 
sacrifices the alliance of a nation whose impotency is notorious, 
who has given no proof of regard for us, and the genius of 
whose Government, religion, and manners, unfits them of all the 
nations in Christendom for a coalition with this country? Can 
anything, too, as you well observ. be more unequal than a 
stipulation which is to open all our ports to her, and some only, 
and those the least valuable, of hers to us ; and which places 
the commercial freedom of our ports against the fettered regulations of those in Spain ? I always thought the stipulation 
with France and Holland of the privileges of the most favoured 
nation unequal, and only to be justified by the influence which 
the treaties could not fail to have on the event of the war. A 
stipulation putting Spanish subjects on the same footing with 
our own citizens is carrying the evil still farther, without the 
same pretext for it, and is the more to be dreaded, as by 
making her the most favored nation it would let in the other 
nation with whom we are now connected to the same privileges, 
whenever they may find it their interest to make the same 
compensation for them, whilst we have not a reciprocal right 
to force them into such an arrangement in case our interest 
should dictate it. 
</p><p>
A guaranty is, if possible, still more objectionable. If it be 
insidious, we plunge ourselves into infamy; if sincere, into obligations the extent of which cannot easity be determined. In 
either case we get farther into the labyrinth of European politics, from which we ought religiously to keep ourselves as free 
as possible. And what is to be gained by such a rash step? 
Will any man in his senses pretend that our territory needs 
such a safeguard, or that, if it were in danger, it is the arm of 
Spain that is to save it? Viewing the matter in this light, I 
cannot but flatter myself that if the attempt you apprehend 
should be made, it will be rejected with becoming indignation. 
</p><p>
I am less sanguine as to the issue of the other matter contained in your letter. I know the mutual prejudices which 
impede every overture towards a just and final settlement of 
claims and accounts. I persist in the opinion that a proper 
and speedy adjustment is unattainable from any assembly constituted as Congress is, and acting under the impulse which 
they must. I need not repeat to you the plan which has always 
appeared to me most likely to answer the purpose. In the 
mean time it is mortifying to see the other States, or rather 
their Representatives, pursuing a course which will make the 
case more and more difficult, and putting arms into the hands 
of the enemies to every amendment of our federal system. God 
knows that they are formidable enough in this State without 
such an advantage. With it, their triumph will be certain and 
easy. But I have been led much farther already than I proposed, and will only that 
</p><p>
I am with the sincerest affection, your friend and serv.
