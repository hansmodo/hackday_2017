Yesterday we took leave of our friends and the many pleasant acquaintances we had made at Carson City, and returned by stage to Reno, in time to take the night train going west. We had an exciting ride. The stage team consisted of six horses, fat, sleek and fast. The famous Hank Monk held the ribbons--the same chap who drove Horace Greeley over the mountain road to Placerville, a few years ago, in time to lecture. On entering the coach, I alluded to the fact, and requested a specimen of his skill; but remarked that I was a good democrat and didn't think I deserved, on the score of political sins, so hard a jolting as he gave Greeley. But we had no sooner started than the speed began to increase, until the jolts became so intolerable that I implored moderation. "Hank" replied to me as he did to Horace, "Keep your seat, sir." This I tried to do, but the
more I tried the more I couldn't, and the result was, we reached Reno, a distance of thirty-three miles, an hour and a half ahead of time. The moment "Hank" entered the hotel, I congratulated him, extolled the speed of his horses and his horsemanship, and gave the barkeeper an intimation that put Hank in good spirits, or rather good spirits into Hank, a compliment which he acknowledged with a very low, conciliatory bow; and thereupon we parted, exchanging a profusion of kind wishes for each other's success in the journey of life.

Reno is an important railroad station, extemporized of canvas and rough boards, contains six or seven hundred inhabitants, and takes its name from Gen. Reno, who was killed in battle at South Mountain. It is built without much regard to order; yet is rapidly advancing in wealth and population, and promises to become the leading city of the mountains. It is located within a rich and extensive mining district, and only twenty miles from Virginia City. Almost every mushroom town, though not much but a railroad station, is dignified with the name of a city in this region of the country. Truckee is the great lumber mart of the mountains, and the largest city on the Central. It has a population of nearly five thousand. Not far from here you pass

Donner Lake. It is a beautiful, rock-rimmed basin of water, pure as liquid silver; yet there is connected with it a very sad story of human suffering.
</p><p>
In <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1846">1846</a>, late in the fall, a party of emigrants, who had crossed the plains, arrived at this lake and camped for the night on its borders. They brought with them horses, wagons, and a few head of horned cattle, but their provisions were nearly exhausted. The party consisted of sixteen persons, among whom were Mr. Donner, his <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ted">wife</a> and four children. During the night there came on a violent snow storm, which continued for three days, and completely blockaded every avenue of escape. Their situation became alarming, and the prospect of relief, at so late a period in the season, seemed entirely hopeless; and yet, if they attempted to remain for the winter, they knew they must perish of cold and hunger.
</p><p>
In view of this fearful state of things, the strong men of the party resolved to make an effort to reach the valley on the coast, and for this purpose saddled the horses, and invited the entire party to join them. But Mr. Donner, being unwell, declined. His wife concluded to remain with him, but permitted her children to go. After the party had mounted their horses, and were about to start, one of them, a stout Dutchman, dismounted and declared his intention to remain
with Donner and his wife. The party then started on their perilous journey, and, after severe struggles and much suffering, reached the valley in safety. Soon after their departure, the cattle and horses left at the camp, escaped, and were lost in the mountains. The remaining scanty supply of provisions in camp were soon exhausted. Starvation came with all its horrors. It is supposed that Donner and the Dutchman cast lots to determine which of the two should lose his life to become food for the others. The lot fell on the Dutchman; but in the conflict, he killed Donner, and when the food thus furnished was consumed, he killed Mrs. Donner. This is probably the truth; for in the spring, when the party in the valley returned to the mountains, with a view to relieve the sufferers, they found the Dutchman in the cabin, greedily gnawing the roasted flesh from a human arm, which had been severed from the body. On searching, they found the mutilated remains of Mrs. Donner, buried in the snow near the cabin. The indications were that she had been murdered. The cannibal was seized, taken to the valley and imprisoned, but refused to give any account of the matter. A few words written on a slip of paper, by Mrs. Donner, and found in the cabin, revealed the manner in which her husband had been killed. In addition to this,
a large sum of money, known to have belonged to Mr. Donner, was found secreted on the Dutchman's person. This was taken from him and awarded to the Donner orphans; but the cannibal was finally acquitted of the crimes charged against him, for want of sufficient legal testimony. He still lives, it is said, and wears the brand of a murderer--a cannibal--burning on his brow. Such is the terrible tragedy, which gave the name of Donner to that beautiful mountain lake.

The highest point on the route over the Sierras, is Summit Station, seven thousand and forty-two feet above the level of the sea. In crossing, we ran through some dozen tunnels, the longest of which is seventeen hundred feet. Some of the bridges that span the gorges, are six to seven stories high, all built of trussel work. They creak and tremble under the weight of the cars, and if you look down into the chasms below, you may expect your head to swim with a dizzy sensation. The immense chasm, called Cape Horn, is, perhaps, the most terrific. Not only its fearful depth, but its sweep of breadth and extent, and its awful overhanging crags of rocks, all combine to make it one of the grandest and most entrancing views of natural scenery anywhere to be found. In this part of the route there are sixty miles of snowsheds, erected to protect the road from snow-slides
that descend from the higher parts of the mountains, and snow drifts that would otherwise accumulate on the track. The sheds are constructed of heavy timber, secured by iron bolts, and roofed with plank, so as to correspond with the slope of the mountain-sides. The side of the sheds over-looking the descent, is boarded up leaving here and there a window space, covered with a board-blind, hung on hinges, which is lifted and left open in the milder portions of the year, so as to allow passengers to catch a view of the passing scenery. The train, like a huge anaconda, seems to leap the chasms, and wind itself around the mountain sides, gliding with a terrific hiss through the dark snow-sheds and dismal tunnels, as if in pursuit of prey, or frightened by some implacable enemy.

In the vicinity of Gold Run, a small town in the mountains, we saw abundant evidences of surface mining for gold. The soil for miles has been dug over and upturned by the miners. On both sides of the road there are long lines of flumes, constructed of plank or boards, conducting currents of water to suit the several localities of the diggings. Cleats or strips of board are nailed across the bottom plank of the flume, to arrest the particles of gold as they float, which are heavier than the drifting soil, and therefore sink and lodge against the cleats or stops. Large
amounts of gold-dust have been obtained in this simple way. The same method is adopted in hundreds of other localities, but has become much less remunerative than formerly, owing to the exhaustion of the surface mines, so far as they have yet been discovered. The quartz rock mines, where mills are employed, are now regarded as much the most reliable, as well as the most productive. Near this is Colfax, a very pretty town, which exhibits much good taste in the style of its buildings, especially its public buildings. It takes its name from Schuyler Colfax, now Vice-President of the United States, and has about twelve hundred inhabitants.

The descent down the western slope of the Sierras is comparatively steep and rapid, and soon accomplished. The "Junction" at the foot is the last eating station going west. It is so called because the Central connects here with the Sacramento and Oregon Railroad. It is here we first entered the great coast valley of California. From here the country is generally level in the direction of the Pacific, and the plains begin to widen as you proceed. They are rich in point of soil, and here and there you will see herds of cattle and horses roaming at will. There are no fences. In the winter and spring months, California, they say, may justly be called "The Flowery Kingdom,"
nor do I pretend to doubt it; but, at this particular season of the year, it looks like a vast desert. At least, it so appeared to me, as I saw it in this, my first vision of the Sacramento valley. There is nothing green to be seen. Everything is dry as a husk, far and near, except gardens and other spots irrigated by artificial means.

The City of Sacramento, where we arrived at noon, is situated on the east side of the river, bearing the same name. It is quite a large city, famous for its enterprise and great wealth. The leading men here are not men of straw, but men of pluck and of enlarged views. Nothing, however formidable, seems too much for them to undertake. A few years ago the city was but a hamlet, a mere outpost on the borders of the mining district; but now, though nearly destroyed several times by fire and flood, it has become a rich and flourishing city, containing some thirty thousand inhabitants. It is the capital of California, and within a hundred and twenty-six miles of San Francisco. Its leading hotels and public edifices are built on a large scale and in magnificent style. It is the grand centre of railroads and machine shops, and manufacturing establishments, of almost every kind. The shops belonging to the Pacific Central cover twenty acres of ground. These shops are supplied with water by artesian
wells. The car-shop alone employs three hundred and seventy men. In connection with the shops there is a hospital, built by the railroad company, for the care of sick and disabled workmen. Of all the American cities I have yet seen, I think Sacramento not only the most enterprising, but possessed of the most solid wealth, considering its population.
