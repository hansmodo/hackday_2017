MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
IN this country, as in all others, men are much addicted to " hobby horses." These nags are called in 
the language of the Dutch " Liefhebbery," as they are 
called in French " Marotte." I had rather ride a 
Dutch hobby horse than an English one, or a French. 
It is the wholesomest exercise in the world. They 
live to great age by the strength of it. 
</p><p>
My meaning is this. They pitch in early life upon 
some domestic amusement, which they follow all their 
days at leisure hours. I shall give you the history of 
several. yesterday made a visit to one, aM. Lionet, 
a venerable old man of seventy-five, in full health, 
strength and vivacity, respectable for several offices 
which he holds, but more so for vast learning in various kinds, and great ingenuity. His hobby horse has 
been natural knowledge. We went to see a collection of marine shells. We were two hours, and had 
not got half through. The infinite variety of figures 
and colors is astonishing. 
</p><p>
But his curiosity has not been confined to shells. 
It has extended to insects, and he has had it in contemplation to write as full an account of these, as Buffon has written of birds, beasts and fishes. But 
beginning with caterpillars, he has filled a folio upon 
that species, and he drew and engraved the plates 
himself. Thus he rode his hobby horse and lived. 
Without it he would have died fifty years ago. Have 
you an inclination to read and inspect cuts of the 
anatomy of caterpillars their nerves, blood, juices, 
bones, hair, senses, intellects, &c., &c., their moral 
sense, their laws, government, manners and customs. I 
don t know whether he teaches the manner of destroying them and saving the apple tree. I doubt not 
the book is worth studying. All nature is so. But I 
have too much to do to study men and their mischievous designs upon apple trees and other things, ever to 
be very intimate with Monsieur Lionet (whom I respect 
very much, however,) or his book. 
</p><p>
Adieu.
