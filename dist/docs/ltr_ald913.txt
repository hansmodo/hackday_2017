. . .AS FOR the aristocracy of wealth, I don't know what it is here, nor the aristocracy of employment, and that is one of the good features of the country. Look at that rough-looking customer driving a dray, and now look into that eating house or hotel, at that plainly dressed woman behind the counter or waiting upon the table. How do you know but that the drayman has been a member of Congress, is a gentleman of education and distinction, or the woman a lady of refined manners, reared in the lap of luxury, and with a high order of talents? Go to an evening party; they may be the life and soul of as elite, as polished a circle as you ever saw. What would you think of a man selling newspapers about the streets of Ottawa? Would your aristocrats make him at home in their circles? I tell you (for I know him well) that a more polished gentleman does not exist. His acquirements are of the highest order, and he could fascinate you with his intellectual conversation, and no one man in California possesses more influence with the mass, who is more courted or more trusted than he, and all doors are open to receive him. He can be the madman or the critic as he pleases, and he knows what he is about! Yet selling newspapers in the streets of this city is his employment
</p><p>
Intellect is the true aristocracy as yet, and "birds of a feather flock together." Sans hat, shoes or shirts. If employment were to drive a man from kindred association where the d--l should I find company?

Since I have been a citizen of this ilk, I have actually and bona fide been teamster, cook, canal digger, engineer, doctor, merchant, mule driver, miner, artist, and speculator, mended my own clothes, washed my own shirts, the last a confounded mean job, and I always mentally exclaimed, God help the poor women! as I was rubbing in the soap, and went barefoot for two weeks.
</p><p>
Really though, if I was going to a party either in Illinois or Sacramento, I would sew up the holes in my pants and get a pair of shoes or not go, just to save the feelings of my friends who might be a little scrupulous, for in "Turkey you must do as the Turkeys do" and gobble accordingly. When I lived with the Indians, I paid a decent regard to their feelings and customs, and in extreme hot days only wore my shirt, and the only remark it occasioned was the ridiculous whiteness of my legs; but they called me "tope Wanamah" (good fellow) and seemed to regard me as one of their own kind.
</p><p>
I am at this moment a citizen of the world with nothing to do. Desirous of a little relaxation I came here on a visit to my friend Colonel Grant, and he has invited me to go to San Francisco with him. We leave at noon to return in three days, and I promise myself a feast as well from his companionship as from a new view of the Pacific. When I return, it will be "work, work, work" like Robin Rougham "Nothing in the world but work," but whether it will be in the preaching line, blacking boots, selling matches or pork and potatoes, I cannot tell. There are two questions which always puzzle me to answer. Where I live and what my business is. It is just anywhere and anything which turns up. If you want to go into a speculation come out and I will give you a share (thirty lots) in Yateston or Hamilton. If you want business you may go snucks with my Indians in catching salmon or crickets.

Cholera is here, thirty to sixty deaths per day Gamblers beginning to be frightened and many leaving. Business falling off rapidly. There appears to be a greasing up of the clouds and we begin to look for the rains. I have seen none of the Ottawa boys lately except Robert Brown. He told me that all whom he had heard from who were engaged in damming the rivers had lost money. I have not seen Fredenburg nor B. K. Thorn since I parted from them last fall and have only two or three times heard from them indirectly. I do not know where they are or what their success has been. It is strange I do not get the Free Trader. I have received only five numbers, but letters come now with much regularity. How many of you citizens may we expect next year?

The great wealth obtained by those who came out last year, the exquisite pleasure of the trip enjoyed by those who came this summer, together with the brilliant prospects before them this winter, will induce another heavy emigration. Plenty of gold dust in the mountains, boys; only get it.
