EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,

December 20, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1862">1862</a>.
</p><p>
HON. WILLIAM H. SEWARD AND HON. SALMON P. CHASE.
</p><p>
GENTLEMEN:--You have respectively tendered me your resignations as
Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury of the United
States.  I am apprised of the circumstances which may render this
course personally desirable to each of you; but after most anxious
consideration my deliberate judgment is that the public interest does
not admit of it. I therefore have to request that you will resume
the duties of your departments respectively.
</p><p>
Your obedient servant,
</p>
