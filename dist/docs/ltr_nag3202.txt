SIR, 
</p><p>
The growing extravagance of the people, and the 
increasing demand for the article of forage in this 
quarter, have become a very alarming affair. Hay is 
from sixty to eighty dollars a ton, and upon the 
rise.* Corn is ten dollars a bushel, and oats four; 
and every thing else, that will answer for forage, in 
that proportion. Carting is nine shillings a mile by 
the ton, and people much dissatisfied with the price. 
I have represented to the States of Rhode Island 
and Connecticut the absolute necessity of legislative 
interposition, to settle the prices of things upon some 
reasonable footing, of all such articles and services as 
are necessary for the use of the public in my department. I am going to do the same to the Council of this State. What effect it will have, I cannot 
say; but, if there is not something done to check 
the extravagance of the people, there are no funds 
in the universe that will equal the expense. 
</p><p>
The late affray that happened in this place, between the people of the town and those of the fleet, 
has been found to originate from a parcel of soldiers 
belonging to the Convention troops, and a party of 
British sailors which were engaged on board a privateer. The secret enemies to our cause, and the British officers in the neighbourhood of this place, are 
endeavouring to sow the seeds of discord as much as possible between the inhabitants of the place and the 
French belonging to the fleet. The French officers are 
well satisfied this is the state of the case, and it 
fills them with double resentment against the British. 
The Admiral and all the French officers are now 
upon an exceeding good footing with the gentlemen 
of the town. <a href='/results.php?tla=joh' rel='colleague'>General Hancock</a> takes unwearied pains 
to promote a good understanding with the French 
officers. His house is full from morning till night. 
</p><p>
I had a letter from the Marquis, day before yester 
day. He writes me he is endeavouring to represent 
every thing in the most favorable colors to the Court 
of France, in order to wipe away the prejudices that 
the letters of some of the more indiscreet may make 
upon that Court, All the French officers are extravagantly fond of your Excellency; but the Admiral 
more so than any of the rest. They all speak of you 
with the highest reverence and respect. General 
Hancock made the Admiral a present of your picture. 
He was going to receive it on board the fleet by 
the firing a royal salute. But <a href='/results.php?tla=joh' rel='colleague'>General Hancock</a> 
thought it might furnish a handle for some of the 
speculative politicians to remark the danger of characters becoming too important. He therefore dissuaded the Admiral from carrying the matter into 
execution. 
</p><p>
I find, by your Excellency's letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a>, that you expect the enemy are going to evacuate <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and that it is probable they are 
coming eastward. I can hardly think they mean to 
make an attempt upon <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, notwithstanding the 
object is important; and, unless they attack <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>,there is no other object worthy their attention in 
New England. I am rather inclined to think they 
mean to leave the United States altogether. What 
they hold here now, they hold at a great risk and 
expense. But, suppose they actually intend to quit 
the Continent, they will endeavour to mislead our attention, and that of our allies, until they can get 
clear of the coast. The Admiral is fortifying for the 
security of his fleet; but I am told his batteries are 
all open in the rear, which will be but a poor security against a land force. <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='colleague'>General Heath</a> thinks there ought to be some Continental troops sent here : 
but the Council will not turn out the militia; they 
are so confident the enemy are not coming here. If 
your Excellency thinks the enemy really design an 
attack upon <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, it may not be useless for you 
to write your opinion to the Council Board, for I 
suspect they think the General here has taken the 
alarm without sufficient reasons. The fortifications 
round this place are very incomplete, and little or 
nothing doing upon them. I have given General 
Heath my opinion what parts to take possession of, 
if the enemy should attempt the place before the 
Continental army gets up. From four to five hundred troops have arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>; their collective 
strength will make a formidable army. 
</p><p>
I wish to know your Excellency's pleasure about 
my returning to camp. I expect Mrs. Greene will 
be put to bed every day. She is very desirous of 
my stay until that event; and, as she has set her 
heart so much upon it, I could wish to gratify her, 
for fear of some disagreeable consequences, as women 
sometimes, under such circumstances, receive great 
injury by being disappointed. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> granted me leave to come here 
upon the business of my department. I expect to 
return in a few days. Major Gibbs is with me, and 
is going to Portsmouth. 
This is the third letter I have wrote since I have 
had a line from your Excellency. Should be glad to 
hear from you when at leisure. 
</p><p>
I am your Excellency's obedient servant, 
</p><p>
