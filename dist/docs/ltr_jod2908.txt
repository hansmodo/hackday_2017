ENCLOSED with this, you have a correspondence between the two Generals concerning the cartel for the 
exchange of prisoners. Washington is in the right, 
and has maintained his argument with a delicacy and 
dignity, which do him much honor, lie has hinted at 
the flagitious conduct of the two Howes towards their 
prisoners in so plain and clear a manner that he can 
not be misunderstood, but yet a decency and a delicacy are preserved, which is the more to be applauded, because the natural resentment of such atrocious 
cruelties renders it very difficult to avoid a more 
pointed language in describing them. They might, 
indeed, without much impropriety have been painted 
in crimson colors of a deeper die. If Mr. Howe's 
heart is not callous, what must be his feelings when he recollects the standings, the freezings, the pestilential diseases, with which he coolly and deliberately 
destroyed the lives of so many unhappy men ! If 
his conscience is not seared, how will he bear its 
lashes when he remembers his breach of honor, his 
breach of faith, his offence against humanity and divinity, his neighbor, and his God (if he thinks there is 
any such Supreme Being,) in impairing health that he 
ought to have cherished, and in putting an end to lives 
that he ought to have preserved, and in choosing the 
most slow, lingering and torturing death that he could 
have devised. I charitably suppose, however, that he 
would have chosen the shortest course and would have 
put every man to the sword or bayonet, and thereby 
have put an end to their sufferings at once, if he could 
have done it without detection. But this would have 
been easily proved upon him, both by friends and enemies, whereas, by hunger, frost and disease he might 
commit the murders with equal certainty, and yet be 
able to deny that he had done it. He might lay it to 
hurry, to confusion, to the fault of commissaries and 
other officers; nay, might deny that they were 
starved, frozen, and infected. He was determined to 
put them out of the way and yet to deny it ; to get 
rid of his enemies and yet save his reputation. But his reputation is ruined forever.

The two brothers will be ranked by posterity with Pizarro, with Borgia, with Alva, and with others in 
the annals of infamy, whose memories are entitled to the hisses and execrations of all virtuous men. These two unprincipled men are the more detestable, because 
they were in the opposition at home, their connexions, friendships and interest lay with the opposition ; 
to the opposition they owed their rise, promotion and importance. Yet they have basely deserted their 
friends and party, and have made themselves the servile tools of the worst of men in the worst of causes. 
But what will not desperate circumstances tempt men to do, who are without principle and who have a 
strong, aspiring ambition, a towering pride and a tormenting avarice ? These two Howes were very poor, 
and they have spent the little fortunes they had in bribery at elections, and having obtained scats in Parliament, and having some reputation as brave men, they had nothing to do but to carry their votes and their valor to market, and, it is very true, they have sold them at a high price.

Are titles of honor the reward of infamy ? Is gold a compensation for vice ? Can the one or the other 
give that pleasure to the heart, that comfort to the mind, which it derives from doing good ? from a consciousness of acting upon upright and generous principles, of promoting the cause of right, freedom and the happiness of men ? Can wealth, or titles soften 
the pains of the mind upon reflecting that a man has done evil and endeavored to do evil to millions, that 
lie has destroyed free governments, and established tyrannies? I would not be a Howe for all the empires 
of the earth and all the riches and glories thereof. Who would not rather be brave even though unfortunate in the cause of liberty ? who would not rather be 
Sidney than Monk ? However, if I am not deceived, misfortune as well 
as infamy awaits these men. They are doomed to defeat and destruction. It may take time to effect it, 
but it will certainly come. America is universally convinced of the necessity of meeting them in the field in firm battalion, and American fire is terrible.
