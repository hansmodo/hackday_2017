Sir, 
</p><p>
I hasten to reply to the letter, which you did me the honor 
to write to me on the nineteenth instant. 
</p><p>
Infinitely pained at the afflicting details contained in that 
letter, I thought it my duty to communicate it immediately to 
the Comite de Salut Public, a copy of whose report I send 
herewith. You will here find a sincere expression of sentiments, which I approve, and of the opinion of the Executive 
Provisory Council. I have the honor to be, &c. 
</p><p>

Report of the Comite de Salut Public. 
</p><p>
The Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States has just 
exhibited complaints of a very serious nature against a violation of the right of nations, and of treaties concluded with free 
Americans. 
</p><p>
If the statements set forth therein are accurate, it is not only the interest of the Republic, but the part of honor and justice, to avenge this atrocious violation of all law, and to give 
to the captain of the Little Cherub every satisfaction, which 
is due to him. This crime is so much the more punishable , 
as the captain had sailed from Havre, for the purpose of taking 
from that place a large number of our brethren inhumanly 
driven from Spain, and thus the captures have, in his case, in 
fringed not only the laws of war, but those of hospitality and 
gratitude. 
The Minister of the United States makes complaint, also, 
that the decree of the twenty-third of May, which orders that 
ships of the United States shall not be comprised in the dispositions of that of the ninth of May, has been repealed by the 
decree of the twenty-eighth, and that a definitive report, 
which, by the terms of the decree, ought to have been made 
three days afterwards by the Comite de Salut Public, and that 
of the Marine united, has not yet been presented. The con 
sequence of this delay is, that several American vessels, and, 
among others, one with a very rich cargo, have been sequestered, to the great prejudice of the owners and masters. 
</p><p>
The Minister of Foreign Affairs thinks it his duty to insist 
strenuously on a prompt decision, concerning these complaints 
of the American Minister. He observes, that, besides the 
ties of fraternity, which unite the two nations, the Republic has 
the strongest interest to favor the free Americans, and to take 
their vessels under its special protection. The United States 
are becoming more and more the granary of France and her 
colonies ; they manifest the best dispositions to aid us ; and 
the courage which they have manifested in formally recognizing the French Republic, in spite of the menaces and intrigues 
of England, prove that their friendship for us is above all political and interested views, which might be thought to incline 
them to follow the direction which England, Spain, and Holland have vainly endeavored to give them. 
</p><p>
In view of these consideration it is evident, that the murder 
committed on board the Little Cherub ought to be severely 
punished ; that the captain should receive ample indemnity, as 
well for the loss and injury sustained on board, as for the de 
lays he experienced ; and that, in conformity with the sixteenth article of the treaty of commerce between France and 
the United States, American vessels should enjoy fully, and 
without any exception, the advantage which results from their 
neutrality, in as much as this neutrality facilitates the supplies 
of provisions to the Republic and to her colonies.
