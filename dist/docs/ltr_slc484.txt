                     To Mrs. Clemens, in Hartford:
</p><p>
                                   PALMER HOUSE, CHICAGO, Nov. 11.
</p><p>
Livy darling, I am getting a trifle leg-weary.  Dr. Jackson called and
dragged me out of bed at noon, yesterday, and then went off.  I went down
stairs and was introduced to some scores of people, and among them an
elderly German gentleman named Raster, who said his wife owed her life to
me--hurt in Chicago fire and lay menaced with death a long time, but the
Innocents Abroad kept her mind in a cheerful attitude, and so, with the
doctor's help for the body she pulled through....  They drove me to Dr.
Jackson's and I had an hour's visit with Mrs. Jackson.  Started to walk
down Michigan Avenue, got a few steps on my way and met an erect,
soldierly looking young gentleman who offered his hand; said, "Mr.
Clemens, I believe--I wish to introduce myself--you were pointed out to
me yesterday as I was driving down street--my name is Grant."
</p><p>
"Col. Fred Grant?"
</p><p>
"Yes.  My house is not ten steps away, and I would like you to come and
have a talk and a pipe, and let me introduce my wife."
</p><p>
So we turned back and entered the house next to Jackson's and talked
something more than an hour and smoked many pipes and had a sociable good
time.  His wife is very gentle and intelligent and pretty, and they have
a cunning little girl nearly as big as Bay but only three years old.
They wanted me to come in and spend an evening, after the banquet, with
them and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Gen. Grant</a>, after this grand pow-wow is over, but I said I was
going home Friday.  Then they asked me to come Friday afternoon, when
they and the general will receive a few friends, and I said I would.
Col. Grant said he and Gen. Sherman used the Innocents Abroad as their
guide book when they were on their travels.
</p><p>
I stepped in next door and took Dr. Jackson to the hotel and we played
billiards from 7 to 11.30 P.M.  and then went to a beer-mill to meet some
twenty Chicago journalists--talked, sang songs and made speeches till 6
o'clock this morning.  Nobody got in the least degree "under the
influence," and we had a pleasant time.  Read awhile in bed, slept till
11, shaved, went to breakfast at noon, and by mistake got into the
servants' hall.  I remained there and breakfasted with twenty or thirty
male and female servants, though I had a table to myself.
</p><p>
A temporary structure, clothed and canopied with flags, has been erected
at the hotel front, and connected with the second-story windows of a
drawing-room.  It was for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Gen. Grant</a> to stand on and review the
procession.  Sixteen persons, besides reporters, had tickets for this
place, and a seventeenth was issued for me.  I was there, looking down on
the packed and struggling crowd when Gen. Grant came forward and was
saluted by the cheers of the multitude and the waving of ladies'
handkerchiefs--for the windows and roofs of all neighboring buildings
were massed full of life.  Gen. Grant bowed to the people two or three
times, then approached my side of the platform and the mayor pulled me
forward and introduced me.  It was dreadfully conspicuous.  The General
said a word or so--I replied, and then said, "But I'll step back,
General, I don't want to interrupt your speech."
</p><p>
"But I'm not going to make any--stay where you are--I'll get you to make
it for me."
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wts" rel="met">General Sherman</a> came on the platform wearing the uniform of a full
General, and you should have heard the cheers.  Gen. Logan was going to
introduce me, but I didn't want any more conspicuousness.
</p><p>
When the head of the procession passed it was grand to see <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=phs" rel="met">Sheridan</a>, in
his military cloak and his plumed chapeau, sitting as erect and rigid as
a statue on his immense black horse--by far the most martial figure I
ever saw.  And the crowd roared again.
</p><p>
It was chilly, and Gen. Deems lent me his overcoat until night.  He came
a few minutes ago--5.45 P.M., and got it, but brought Gen. Willard, who
lent me his for the rest of my stay, and will get another for himself
when he goes home to dinner.  Mine is much too heavy for this warm
weather.
</p><p>
I have a seat on the stage at Haverley's Theatre, tonight, where the Army
of the Tennessee will receive <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Gen. Grant</a>, and where Gen. Sherman will
make a speech.  At midnight I am to attend a meeting of the Owl Club.
</p><p>
I love you ever so much, my darling, and am hoping to
get a word from you yet.
</p>
                                   SAML.
