Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have already written to you a letter this day on the cur 
rent affairs. This will be devoted to a different object. I 
have lately seen in a gazette your report on the inquiries received from the belligerent powers, and also some debates in 
our House of Representatives on a discrimination between 
those nations with whom we have a commercial treaty, and 
those with whom we have none. I observe that some frigates 
are to be built for the protection of our trade. These things 
have suggested, or rather recalled, ideas which I will venture 
to communicate at the risk of tiring your patience. 
</p><p>
While I had the honor to sit in Congress during the war, it 
was my lot to oppose what then appeared to me a rage for 
treaties ; and yet the respectability, which our cause was sup 
posed to acquire by the acknowledgment of European Potentates, militated in favor of those, who wished to extend our 
diplomacy. At the peace, however, that ground of argument 
was removed. Moreover, we found ourselves in a situation 
unfavorable to the forming of treaties, because there was no 
constitutional authority to enforce the observance of them. 
Those powers, therefore, who might contract with us, were 
exposed not only to the common danger of a wilful violation 
on our part, but to that also of a general non-performance and 
of individual injury, without the permission, and beyond 
the control, of government. The obligations, therefore, not 
being equal, it was not deemed prudent by some to enter into 
engagements with the United States ; and thus we fell our selves sinking beneath the level of national character. 
</p><p>
Our new Constitution made ample provision on that subject ; and,, if I mistake not, a steady adherence to its principles will place us first in dignity, as in good faith, among 
political societies. Our treaties now form the supreme law of 
the land, and therefore our situation, in respect to foreign 
powers, is reversed ; for they can violate their contracts with 
us, but we cannot violate our contracts with them ; neither 
have we, perhaps, any constitutional means of annulling our 
obligations, when they shall have broken their engagements, 
I will not here inquire how far it would be proper to make 
a provision of that sort, as an amendment to the Constitution, 
nor whether it would not in effect destroy the clause, which 
has rendered treaties on our part inviolable ; but I will venture to infer from this our relative position, that we should 
be cautious what treaties we form,, and with whom. What 
treaties, because, if contingent engagements become onerous 
to us, we must comply with them ; whereas, should they be 
come onerous to those with whom we have contracted, they 
may release themselves. We should be cautious also with 
whom we treat, because in the contingency last stated, some 
nations will release themselves, and others will not. Now, in 
political as in natural bodies, decisions of the will depend, so 
far as good faith is concerned, on moral character and constitution. 
</p><p>
We have at present to complain, that both Britain and 
France have violated their treaties with us. Yet I can by no 
= means consider the cases equal ; for as to Britain, the act 
proceeded from cool meditation of regular government ; but 
in France, it is one among many bad effects of that extraordinary situation into which she is thrown. Without dwelling 
farther on this distinction, I shall endeavor to state those 
objections to the multiplication of treaties, which formerly 
swayed my opinion ; and, first, it is no small one, that we 
should be thereby drawn into the vortex of European politics, 
which we should, I think, avoid as much as possible. Not 
that we should be wholly unmindful of what passes in this 
hemisphere ; on the contrary, I am persuaded that we ought 
to be extremely watchful ; but I would draw a strong broad 
line between vigilance and activity. 
</p><p>
Secondly, it has always appeared to me, that the less we 
are fettered by diplomatic engagements, the better shall we be 
able to preserve a firm and equal conduct in difficult cases. 
The law of nations may be likened to the common law, in that 
all cases heretofore doubtful have been settled by able judges ; 
whereas each treaty, like a new statute, gives rise to intricate 
questions, and the ultimate mode of determining them makes a 
good mind shudder. 
</p><p>
Thirdly, it has also appeared to me, that in most controversies between European powers, we should preserve an exact 
neutrality. We may safely leave them to adjust their balance of power in their own way, because, if either of the 
scales should prove too heavy for us, the means of lightening it are at hand, and completely within our grasp. Now 
I am convinced that a neutrality may be most easily preserved, 
when no belligerent power can rightfully claim any privilege ; 
because, by conferring such privilege at our pleasure, we can 
sufficiently punish either of the parties for the injuries and 
indignities we may have cause to complain of. 
</p><p>
Lastly, I cannot but think that our present, compared with our future situation, is such that in treating now, we must make 
bad bargains, even were there any tribunal to enforce the performance in a peaceable way. The paucity of our numbers, 
the apparent feebleness of our pecuniary resources, the want of naval and military force, even the extent of our dominion, 
which is, from that circumstance, of difficult defence and easy invasion, will prevent others from granting, will even prevent 
us from asking, what we ought to have, in order that a treaty made now should be reasonable in ten years, or tolerable in 
twenty. Whatever may be the intrinsic worth of these reasons, certainly they derive weight from that morality of our national 
constitution, which has been already noticed. 
</p><p>
This constitution was made subsequent to our existent treaties, and even after the violation by Great Britain of that which 
concluded the war. Happily she has hitherto eluded a compliance, and thereby prevented the forming of a commercial 
treaty. I say happily, because I am persuaded that in a few years we shall have occasion to rejoice, and the British to regret, that perversity of counsels, which prevented their Ministers from meeting our advances. 
</p><p>
We complain justly also, that France has broken her treaty 
with us, more especially to confiscate goods of her enemies on 
board our ships. This decree is evidently against her own 
interest ; but, in my opinion, the clause in our treaty, thereby 
annulled, was injurious to our interest. As to the maxim, that 
free ships make free goods, the arguments pro and con are 
familiar to us, and, therefore, I shall not enter into them. But 
the fair conclusion of those in favor of it goes to a protection 
of all commercial property on the ocean. Therefore, the 
maxim, even were it just, would not be generally admitted until the practice of making prizes were wholly abandoned. 
Then all such clauses in a treaty would be superfluous, and 
until then, unless enforced by a strong marine, they will be 
nugatory. 
</p><p>
But it seems to me, from the view which I am enabled to 
take of our commerce, that however the transportation, in our 
ships, of goods belonging to subjects of a belligerent power, 
might prove a momentary advantage to our merchants, it must 
be injurious to our general interests. I take it for ganted, that 
our shipping is not sufficient to pursue the fisheries and to carry our own produce to market. But if it were, I should con 
sider those as the proper employments, and I should reason 
thus. By putting half of the navigation employed in transporting our own productions into this neutral carrying trade, half 
of those productions must remain on hand, or be transported 
by the belligerent powers, and in either case our agricultural 
interests must suffer ; for, as to other neutrals, their shipping 
will be employed in the same neutral carrying trade. Now if 
this reasoning be just, on the ground that we had a sufficiency 
of shipping, how much more forcible is it in the fact of an in 
sufficiency. But it may be said, that the neutral carrying 
trade, by giving encouragement to our shipping, would greatly 
increase the amount. I answer, of our fictitious shipping, 
yes; of our real shipping, no; and merchants will understand 
me. 
</p><p>
Moreover, I state hypothetically, either we have the tonnage 
needful for I our commerce, or we have not. If we have not, 
the increased freight of our own commodities will, in time of 
war, be a sufficient encouragement, and draw into that channel 
as much of the national strength and wealth as is consistent 
with the general welfare, and more perhaps, if we extend our 
views to all the moral effects of commerce, especially when it 
engages a disproportionate part of the society. If our navigation be equal to the employment our commerce can give it, 
any increase would be doubly pernicious. First, because 
throwing the surplus out of employ would occasion loss to 
owners in general, since they would be forced to underwork 
each other, till, by the ruin of some, things would return to 
their natural level. And secondly, because, whatever difference there may be in opinions, as to the propriety of taking 
men from the plough, in a thinly peopled country, to ply the 
loom or bend the sail, while manufactures and navigation are 
unequal to the demand, no man of sound mind will contend, 
that we should leave our fields untilled to rival populous countries in the carrying trade. In our vast territory, a fertile soil 
and excellent clime invite to rural and domestic bliss, the 
source of a vigorous and virtuous population. Why then 
should we imitate those who, by the severity of nature, are 
driven to seek on the ocean a subsistence, which the land denies, and who find, in the casualties of that dangerous element, 
a resource against excessive numbers ? 
</p><p>
Having said thus much on treaties, I come now to their 
sanction, an American marine. Whatever apprehensions may 
be entertained from a standing army, nothing is to be feared 
from a standing navy ; wherefore, I think we should not fol 
low the European example of building ships to lie idle, until a 
war calls them into action, at a great increase of expense, and 
by great injury to commerce. This may suit the ambitious, 
who wish to extend their possessions ; but a peaceable nation, 
placed as we are, should, I think, make perpetual provision 
for every ship that is built, and her fleet should be annually manned, victualed, and equipped, and should cruise during the fine season. I believe that we could now maintain 
twelve ships of the line, perhaps twenty, with a due proportion of frigates and smaller vessels. And I am tolerably certain, that while the United States of America pursue a just 
and liberal conduct, with twenty sail of the line at sea, no nation on earth will dare to insult them. I believe also that, not 
to mention individual losses, five years of war would involve 
more national expense, than the support of a navy for twenty 
years. One thing I am thoroughly convinced of, that, if we 
do not render ourselves respectable, we shall continue to be 
insulted. And let it not be supposed, that a remedy for our 
weakness can be found in Conventions with other powers for 
preserving neutrality. In such Conventions there are often 
dupes, and it is the weaker who go to the wall. 
</p><p>
During the last war, no sooner had the Dutch acceded to 
the armed neutrality, than Great Britain fell upon them, and 
those who set the plan a going looked on with all imaginable 
composure. In the late treaty between Denmark and Sweden, you will observe that time is given to the belligerent powers for repentance and amendment, before any hostile act of 
resentment by the contracting parties. You will observe, also, 
that the period specified is sufficient to permit the arrestation 
of all supplies shipped for this country, during the present sea 
son. Thus the next autumn and winter are left clear for negotiation, should the Mies be unsuccessful in this campaign. 
That treaty, therefore, may be considered as a demonstration 
of a force and temper, which do not exist ; and no one in this 
quarter is the dupe of such appearances. 
</p><p>
But what can be done by the weak, to preserve their little 
air of dignity ? They do not wish to join the coalition, and 
they dare not connect their fortunes with the French Republic, lest in a sudden change of government she should join 
those now acting against her. All that is left, therefore, is to 
temporize with the best grace they can. 
</p><p>
It is time to conclude this too long letter. Believe, I pray 
you, in the sincerity of that esteem and respect, with which I 
have the honor to be, &c.
