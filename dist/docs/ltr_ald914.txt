DIG, dig, dig, and so I did, till I dug two thousand dollars and over, but hang me if I didn't dig it out of pocket instead of in. I prospected through spectacles and cañons with spectacles and without, and such spectacles as I saw of men who had dug and worked till their faces were gaunt and their nether garments were dilapidated, with pockets torn off, proved the truth of the old saw that "all is not gold that glitters." So I came to the conclusion that if I was made for the mountains the mountains were not made for me to get rich in. I had heard, too, that to make money a man must go where people are, for there the money is. I had been where people were not, and I knew it didn't pay, so I commenced prospecting in new diggings.

When I left Marysville I had no more idea of going below Sacramento City than you have of going to the moon, but I wanted to see Colonel Grant. You know him--so do I, like a book--Mem., keep a copy of that book always on hand.

Now, how he treated me I shan't say, only that if he has many such hangers-on, he'll be ruined; from which, and from his multitude of friends, "God deliver him." If he had only one shirt he'd tear it in two and give the half to a friend. He was going to San Francisco and invited me to accompany him, an offer which my modesty could not resist, especially as the True Delta is, somehow, a password not to be questioned by steamboat men on the Sacramento when it comes through his lips. I had heard of San Francisco, a kind of out-of-the-way place in the lowlands, where barbarians from all countries congregated, where the fulsomeness of their ridiculous fashions, manners, and customs offends the eye, and I determined to go, even at the expense of losing caste. You know I came across the plains, that I have lived chiefly in the mountains, that I have sung of the native beauties in their grass aprons and costumes à la Nature, that I have praised the noble-hearted miners with their flowing beards, that I have described the scenery of the hills, and that my experience in the world above (I mean up the River) is such that I can see and judge without prejudice, however different things may be from what I have been accustomed to. Pshaw! there's no egotism in that--not here, anyhow--so don't pucker your mouth yet; you'll pucker it worse by and by.

Did you ever hear of the New World? Not Captain Columbus's nor any of the islands about New Orleans. I mean the steamboat on the Sacramento, Captain Wakeman--ain't she a crack boat, and ain't the Captain some? Everything on board goes like clockwork except the engine, and that goes by steam, and the boat goes like a locomotive. Everything in tip-top style, cabins, tables, staterooms, magnificent; cook, steward, chamber- boy, and waiter, civil and obliging, and the Captain's a gentleman. Can I say more? It will pay a man to lay over a week just to make a trip on her. Well, we went on board. The cholera was bad at Sacramento, and Colonel Grant was not well. A rumbling in the lower regions was a premonitory symptom, and knowing that No. 6 was good for the epidemic, he wisely took stateroom No. 6, which with a free use of morphine, cayenne pepper, and camphor finally quieted the symptomatic indication of volcanic eruption. This is a horrible volcanic country about these days. I found the country as we passed along most tediously level, and I sighed for fifty pounds' weight on my back and a mountain to climb. How awfully dull it was, not a hill which would make a greenhorn puff, and the poor engine had to do it all.

We arrived at San Francisco before daylight, and I sallied out
after sunrise to view a scene which to me was entirely new. How sadly was I disappointed. I had heard the beauty of the Bay described, its capacity to hold thousands of ships, and the town as a city. Why, gentlemen, I couldn't see the Bay at all, for the ships, jammed together like a vast forest of dead pines, hid it entirely, and I "couldn't see the town for houses." Now there isn't a single ranchería in California that you can't see the whole at a glance with all the women and children; and here you couldn't begin--it was abominable. A stranger would require a guide to find his way to any point along the trails, and had it not been for the kind care of Colonel Grant, I should have been prospecting up to this time--a lost miner in the gulches. All the people, and the trails were full as if they had found new diggings, wore clothes--actually fine white shirts, dress coats, and whole pants, with hair combed and brushed like new wigs, boots blacked, and you could scarcely find a check or red flannel shirt in the whole crowd. And then there were carts, drays, candy stands, bookracks, newsboys, and the Lord knows what all in the trails, so plenty that it kept me on a dogtrot to elbow my way through and keep up with the Colonel. Why, I actually saw a woman, at least the Colonel said it was one, with a parasol over her head, a bonnet on, and hang me if she wasn't dressed all over in silk. Thinks I to myself, she never drove team on the sand plain nor made acorn bread in a ranch, poor thing. Here she is cooped up in town without knowing anything of the beauties of nature! I pitied her from my soul.

Everybody knew Colonel Grant just as if he had always lived in the mountains, and they all seemed glad to see him, shaking hands till his arm ached, and finally they got to shaking hands with his shadow. I was his shadow, for the tall houses hid the sun so that he couldn't have any other. So I shook hands till my legs ached, and I finally told the Colonel he must get another shadow, for I was used up. "Well," says he, "let's go to sea." "Go to see who?" says I. "Pshaw! I mean prospecting on the Bay." "Very well," said I, "I'm ready, pick in hand; lead, I'll follow your trail." So he made tracks for a wherry, and after pulling a long way out, we brought up at the foot of the barque Constance, Captain Barry, from Salem Here was a relief--we couldn't go on board without climbing, and I began to feel at home. Climbing the side of a tall ship was no ways equal to climbing a hill five miles high, and the time it took was ridiculously small, but it rested me exceedingly, although it was
prospecting on an entirely new trail. We were met on deck by Captain Barry, whose frank and cordial hospitality was equal to that of an old miner. I somehow felt at home at once, on being ushered into the cabin. That perhaps is not strange, for I have lived in cabins or tents nearly all the time I have been in California, and the fashion of climbing to get into it was much more agreeable than that of stepping off of a flagstone into a hotel; and here, too, I could see a check shirt and a tarpaulin hat without that everlasting bowing and scraping of the barbarians on shore, and the masts, so trim and straight, put me in mind of the glorious old pines of the mountains. Thinks I to myself, this going to sea is not so bad after all. The sea-faring hombres are a civilized race with souls as large as their ships.

We met several captains of other ships on board, and somehow, between tales of the ocean and tales of the mountains and desert, the time slipped like a mountain slide, and it was tea time before a gulch was tested. "Captain," says Grant, "shall you have any griddle cakes for supper?" "I do not think my cook knows how to make them," replied Captain Barry. "Come, D., roll up your sleeves and go into the cookroom and go at it," said G. The captains all laughed at the idea--"He cook? What does he know about cooking? No, no, that's breaking ground a little too strong." "I tell you what," said G., "I must have griddle cakes for supper, and he can make them--I know it." "Captain," says I, rising and throwing off my coat and cap, "don't you know that I came across the plains and have lived in the mountains? Did you ever see a miner who could not cook, wash, mend, make shoes, prospect, and spin yarns? Tell the cook to tote up the flour, and I'll tote up the cakes." We had griddle cakes for tea--I made 'em, and G. said they were better than those I made for him last fall on Mud Hill.

Captain Welsh, of the Merlin, was on board, and he gave a most interesting account of a recent visit to Loo Choo, one of the dependencies of Japan It seemed to me that there were many particulars connected with his visit which would be of importance to our government to know, but as the recital is his own private property, I shall not touch it. He is a gentleman of talents and can make out (as he intends doing) a highly interesting document respecting that strange and peculiar people. I hope you will get his letter, and I promise you a rich treat from its perusal.
</p><p>
We passed two nights on shipboard enjoying the hospitality of Captain Barry, whom I shall long remember, spending our days among the barbarians on shore. I might give you a labored description of San Francisco, but I have hardly time now to go into particulars. I don't think you have got a clear idea of it from any
description which I have read, nor of the manners and customs of the natives. The town is abominably crowded with people, all dressed from top to toe. I haven't seen a naked man or woman in the streets, and their ways are as outré as their appearance. The buildings are overgrown things with doorways so large that you can walk in without getting on your hands and knees. Beef and bread are so ruinously cheap that the very dogs are fed on it, and when a man uses salt, he piles it up to waste just as if it cost nothing, and I actually saw a little boy throw away a piece of bread which he could not eat at once. Just think of the poor starving souls on the plains. Water is of no more account than if a spring lay in every gulch, and--well, well, live and learn--notwithstanding my repugnance, I have about been persuaded to spend this winter here.
