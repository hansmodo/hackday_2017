DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Soon after I had despatched the letter, which I did 
myself the honor to address to your Excellency from 
Stillwater, I met with Lieutenant-Colonel Hay, deputy Quartermaster-General, who was at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. 
lie informs me, that on Saturday it had been agreed 
upon to retreat from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> and Mount Independence ; that between two and three o clock on 
Sunday morning, <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a>, with the rest of 
the General Officers, and the army, marched out of 
the lines at Mount Independence ; that Colonel Long, 
with about six hundred men, embarked on board our 
few vessels, and in. bateaux; that, just before they 
arrived at Skenesborough, they were overtaken by 
the enemy's vessels and gunboats, and were obliged 
to abandon the vessels, in which we lost all our ammunition. Indeed, Colonel Hay assures me that not 
one earthly thing has been saved. 
</p><p>
The troops under Colonel Long are arrived at Fort Ann. Where <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a> is, with the main 
body, I have not yet learnt. Colonel Hay imagined 
he would come by the way of Skenesborough. If so, 
he will fall in with the enemy, who have taken possession there. Captain Dantignac, who is just arrived here, confirms Colonel Hay's account, except 
as to <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a>, who he understood was to 
march to Number Four. This is not likely. I have 
despatched an officer to meet <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a>, and 
requested that he should march, by the shortest route, 
to Fort Edward. As I have related the above from 
memory, I may have omitted some, and misapprehended other circumstances/ 1 
</p><p>
It is impossible to say what post we shall take. It depends on the route the enemy mean to pursue. 
My prospect of preventing them from penetrating, is not much. They have an army flushed with victory, 
plentifully provided with provisions, cannon, and every 
warlike store. Our army, if it should once more collect, is weak in numbers, dispirited, naked, in a manner, destitute of provisions, without camp equipage, 
with little ammunition, and not a single piece of cannon. In this situation, it is of the most urgent necessity, that your Excellency should afford me a 
very respectable reinforcement, besides that now coming up under Brigadier-General Nixon ; for it will be impossible for me to keep the militia together any 
time in a country very thinly inhabited, in which they cannot find shelter, and must lie out exposed to the weather. 
</p><p>
As the Continental troops have lost every thing, 
your Excellency will please to order up to me, the 
soonest possible, tents for four thousand men, five 
hundred camp kettles, a quantity of fixed musket 
ammunition, cartridge-paper, twelve pieces heavy can 
non, with travelling carriages, sixteen field-pieces, and 
a considerable quantity of ammunition for them ; a 
competent number of artillerymen, in addition to 
Major Stevens's corps, so as to be sufficient to man 
age the artillery; all the implements necessary to 
the artillery, horses, harness, and drivers; about six 
hundred intrenching tools, sorted, excluding pickaxes, 
of which we have a considerable number. Please 
also to send me a good engineer or two. I am, dear 
Sir, with great respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
