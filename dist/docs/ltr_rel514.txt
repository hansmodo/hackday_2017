My Dear Governor:  I received your very kind note of the 5th instant,
just as I was about to accompany General Loring's command on an
expedition to the enemy's works in front, or I would have before
thanked you for the interest you take in my welfare, and your too
flattering expressions of my ability.  Indeed, you overrate me much,
and I feel humbled when I weigh myself by your standard.  I am, however,
very grateful for your confidence, and I can answer for my sincerity
in the earnest endeavour I make to advance the cause I have so much
at heart, though conscious of the slow progress I make.  I was very
sanguine of taking the enemy's works on last Thursday morning.  I had
considered the subject well.  With great effort the troops intended
for the surprise had reached their destination, having traversed twenty
miles of steep, rugged mountain paths; and the last day through a
terrible storm, which lasted all night, and in which they had to stand
drenched to the skin in cold rain.  Still, their spirits were good.
When morning broke, I could see the enemy's tents on Valley River, at
the point on the Huttonsville road just below me.  It was a tempting
sight.  We waited for the attack on Cheat Mountain, which was to be
the signal.  Till 10 A. M. the men were cleaning their unserviceable
arms.  But the signal did not come.  All chance for a surprise was
gone.  The provisions of the men had been destroyed the preceding day
by the storm.  They had nothing to eat that morning, could not hold
out another day, and were obliged to be withdrawn.  The party sent to
Cheat Mountain to take that in rear had also to be withdrawn.  The
attack to come off the east side failed from the difficulties in the
way; the opportunity was lost, and our plan discovered.  It is a
grievous disappointment to me, I assure you.  but for the rain-storm,
I have no doubt it would have succeeded.  This, Governor, is for your
own eye.  Please do not speak of it; we must try again.  Our greatest
loss is the death of my dear friend, Colonel Washington.  He and my
son were reconnoitering the front of the enemy.  They came unawares
upon a concealed party, who fired upon them within twenty yards, and
the Colonel fell pierced by three balls.  My son's horse received
three shots, but he escaped on the Colonel's horse.  His zeal for the
cause to which he had devoted himself carried him, I fear, too far.
We took some seventy prisoners, and killed some twenty-five or thirty
of the enemy.  Our loss was small besides what I have mentioned.  Our
greatest difficulty is the roads.  It has been raining in these
mountains about six weeks.  It is impossible to get along.  It is that
which has paralysed all our efforts.  With sincere thanks for your
good wishes,
</p><p>
                            I am very truly yours,

His Excellency, Governor John Letcher.
