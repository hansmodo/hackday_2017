Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The intelligence communicated in mine of yesterday is fully 
confirmed. The accounts given to the Convention are so lame 
and blind, that one is obliged to piece them out like a tattered 
writing, where whole sentences are wanting. 
</p><p>
It would seem, then, that the enemy, though at what time 
is yet uncertain, made an attack on the army which had besieged, or rather bombarded Maestricht, and which was then at 
Tongres. The route has, I believe, been complete, and the 
enemy, by pushing on to St Tron, have cut off the retreat of 
those who were at Liege before the battle, or who fled to it 
afterwards ; so that in all human probability the greater part 
of them have fallen, with all their artillery and stores. They 
had indeed one road open, viz. that along the banks of the 
Meuse up to Huy and Namur ; but whether the enemy in Luxembourg have detached on that side, seems as yet uncertain. 
Probably they have not. It would seem that such of the 
French army, as escaped by the way of St Tron, have been 
totally dissipated, for it is said that the enemy is in possession 
of Brussels ; and of course he must have come on from eighty 
to a hundred miles in the space of four or five days. 
</p><p>
The French have sent off everything they could save to Valenciennes, which is about sixty miles on this side of Brussels, 
and in which the broken remnants of their army will probably 
be collected. Going on the supposition that the allied army is 
at Brussels, it appears to me that Dumouriez is completely cut 
off, unless he be possessed of very considerable magazines, for 
he is, you know, in a horrible country. In front, a navigable 
river, and in the rear a pitiless desert until he gets back to the 
neighborhood of Antwerp, Malines and Louvain. 
</p><p>
Now the enemy could be at Malines as soon as at Brussels, 
these places being equidistant from LouvaiOj through which 
they must in either case have passed, and the distance from Malines to Antwerp is about one third of what Dumouriez had 
to pass over, unless he began his march as soon as he received 
the news, that the enemy were on their way to Maastricht. 
This intelligence did not I presume reach him till the night of 
the third, or morning of the fourth ; and it is a question of moment, whether he took instant, measures for his retreat, which 
must of necessity be slow through the very bad roads which 
he has to struggle with, till he gets to the pavement within 
about a league, if I remember right, of Antwerp. The intention of the enemy is, I am certain, to cut him off; and if that 
be done, God knows what will happen ; for the frontier towns 
are almost without garrisons, the whole force having been called off to the expedition against Holland. 
</p><p>
The force in the low countries has been stated very highly 
by those, who counted on success in that quarter, but I do not 
believe that the whole amounted to more than fifty, or at most sixty thousand ; and should those events, which are now probable, take place, very few of that number will get back again 
to France. I understand that the militia are to be drafted im 
mediately, and what may be the success of that measure can 
not be foreseen. I have not sufficient data on which to fix an 
opinion, but should it be accompanied by delay, or encounter 
opposition, the safety of Paris is more in distance than in 
force. I am, &c.
