Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yesterday, I had the honor to receive your Excellency's letter of the 7th, and am very happy to hear 
such favorable accounts from the southward. I hope our affairs in that quarter will soon wear a more 
pleasing aspect than ever. 
</p><p>
Colonel Sheldon complains to me that his horses 
are much worn down ; and the inhabitants of Westchester complain, that the country is not sufficiently 
guarded against the enemy. I have, therefore, sent 
Colonel Hay fifty men from <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, as more eligible than taking them from the lines. Mr. Stephens 
informs me that there are one hundred hogsheads of 
rum at Springfield, but that teams cannot be procured to bring it on. 
</p><p>
I came here this morning, in order to establish 
signals, to be observed in case the enemy came up 
the river ; to give some directions respecting the 
guard-boats ; and to have a beacon fixed upon the 
mountain, about five miles south of King's Ferry, 
which will be necessary to alarm the country. The 
one fixed there formerly has been destroyed. 
</p><p>
There are some cannon at <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, which are 
of little service, except for signal-guns. " I propose 
sending two of them to Colonel Gouvion, for that 
purpose, if agreeable to your Excellency. A supply 
of cattle, for some, days, had arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a> 
before I left it. I am informed that considerable 
numbers have been crossed at King's Ferry. I am 
in hopes the army will be better supplied in future. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
