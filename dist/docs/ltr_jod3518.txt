THIS moment I had, what shall I say ? the pleasure or the pain of your letter of 25th October. As a letter from my dearest friend it gave me a pleasure that 
it would be in vain to attempt to describe ; but the 
complaints in it gave me more pain than I can express. 
This is the third letter I have received in this com 
plaining style. The former two I have not answered. 
I had endeavored to answer them. I have written 
several answers ; but upon a review, they appeared to 
be such as I could not send. One was angry, another 
was full of grief, and the third with melancholy, so 
that I burnt them all. If you write me in this style, 
I shall leave off writing entirely. It kills me. Can 
profession of esteem be wanting from me to you ? 
Can protestation of affection be necessary ? Can tokens of remembrance be desired ? The very idea of 
this sickens me. Am I not wretched enough in this 
banishment without this ? What course shall I take, 
to convince you that my heart is warm ? You doubt, 
it seems. Shall I declare it ? Shall I swear to it ? 
Would you doubt it the less ? and is it possible you 
should doubt it ? I know it is not. If I could once 
believe it possible, I should not answer for the consequences. But I beg you would never more write to 
me in such a strain, for it really makes me unhappy. 
Be assured, that no time nor place can change my 
heart ; but that I think so often and so much of the 
blessings from which I am separated, as to be too unmindful of those who accompany me ; and that I 
write to you as often as my duty will permit.

I am extremely obliged to the <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague met acquaintance'>Comte D Estaing</a> and 
his officers for their politeness to you, and am very 
glad you have had an opportunity of seeing so much 
of the French nation. The accounts from all hands 
agree, that there was an agreeable intercourse and 
happy harmony, upon the whole, between the inhabitants and the fleets. The more this nation is known, 
and the more their language is understood, the more 
will narrow prejudices wear away. British fleets and 
armies are very different from their's. In point of 
temperance and politeness, there is no comparison.
