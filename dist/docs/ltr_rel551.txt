My Dear Agnes:  I will begin the correspondence of the day by thanking
you for your letter of the 9th.  It will, I am sure, be to me
intellectually what my morning's feast is corporeally.  It will
strengthen me for the day, and smooth the rough points which constantly
protrude in my epistles.  I am glad Robert is with you.  It will be
a great comfort to him, and I hope, in addition, will dissipate his
chills.  He can also accompany you in your walks and rides and be
that silent sympathy (for he is a man of few words) which is so
soothing.  Though marble to women, he is so only externally, and you
will find him warm and cheering.  Tell him I want him to go to see
Miss Francis Galt (I think her smile will awake some sweet music in
him), and be careful to take precautions against the return of the
chills, on the 7th, 14th, and 21st days....  I want very much to have
you all with me again, and miss you dreadfully.  I hope another month
will accomplish it.  In the meantime, you must get very well.  This
is a beautiful spot by nature--man has done but little for it.  Love
to all.  Most affectionately,
</p><p>
                Your father,
