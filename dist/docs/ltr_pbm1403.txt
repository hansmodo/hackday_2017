TO MRS. MADISON FROM MRS. PHOEBE

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>, January 19, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1824">1824</a>. 
</p><p>
MY DEAREST <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=dol" rel="friend met">MRS. MADISON</a>, I have been in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a> about a fortnight, 
where everything reminds me of you ; but alas ! sometimes painfully, for so many 
scenes of joy and sorrow have passed since the happy period of my early youth, which 
was rendered more joyous by your protecting care. We are very comfortably established together at the "six buildings." I 
often think of you and my dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="spouse met">Mr. Madison</a> alone at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=montpelier" rel="city">Montpelier</a>, for you have told 
me that there is not so much visiting in winter. I know all your motions and ways 
so well, that at any hour of the day I can represent to myself what you are doing. 
What do you think of the probability of having the Marquis de <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="">Lafayette</a> for a 
visit, for surely <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=montpelier" rel="city">Montpelier</a> will be the first place to fly to, when he comes to the 
United States. The Secretary of the Navy says he shall have one of the finest 
and best manned vessels in the service to convey him hither, if Mitchell's resolution 
is carried, and he wishes to come, which does not appear as yet quite decided.

Mrs. Monroe is really going to have a drawing-room on Wednesday. You have no doubt seen the description of Mrs. 
Hays's personal elegance of deportment and costume in the papers. We all attended Mrs. Adams's reception on the 8th, 
and it was really a very brilliant party, and admirably well arranged. The ladies 
climbed the chairs and benches to see <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="friend met">General Jackson</a>, and Mrs. Adams very gracefully took his arm, and walked through the 
apartments with him, which gratified the general curiosity. 
</p><p>
It is said there were fourteen hundred cards issued, and about eight hundred supposed to be present.

I would like to hear something of Miss Willis ; whenever I feel a little romantic, 
and think of some pure and innocent being, sheltered from the storms of life, and 
lovely in the bosom of retreat, my imagination turns to that sweet and sympathetic 
girl. I beg you will remember me to her affectionately, my dearest friend, also to 
her excellent mother. How is your mother, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=dol" rel="friend met">MRS. MADISON</a> ? I hope she is as bright 
and active as ever : give my love and respectful admiration to her. Adieu, my 
dearest and best friend ; believe me, as ever, Your own affectionate 
</p><p>
