<p><i>Letter to W.G. Anderson. Lawrenceville, Illinois. October 31, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1840">1840</a></i></p>


<p>Dear Sir, Your note of yesterday is received. In the difficulty between
us of which you speak, you say you think I was the aggressor. I do not
think I was. You say my &quot;words imported insult.&quot; I meant them as a fair
set-off to your own statements, and not otherwise; and in that light
alone I now wish you to understand them. You ask for my present
&quot;feelings on the subject.&quot; I entertain no unkind feelings to you, and
none of any sort upon the subject, except a sincere regret that I
permitted myself to get into such an altercation.</p>
