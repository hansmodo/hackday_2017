<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='10'>10th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=lincolnton' rel='city origin'>LINCOLNTON</a>, N. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. Went to church crying to Ellen, "It is Lent, we must fast and pray." When I came home my 
good fairy, Colonel Childs, had been here bringing rice and potatoes, and promising flour. He is a trump. He pulled 
out his pocket-book and offered to be my banker. He stood there on the street, Miss Middleton and Isabella witnessing 
the generous action, and straight out offered me money. " No, put up that," said I. " I am not a beggar, and I 
never will be ; to die is so much easier. 
</p><p>
Alas, after that flourish of trumpets, when he came with 
a sack of flour, I accepted it gratefully. I receive things I can not pay for, but money is different. There I draw a 
line, imaginary perhaps. Once before the same thing happened. Our letters of credit came slowly in 1845, when we 
went unexpectedly to Europe and our letters were to follow us. I was a poor little, inoffensive bride, and a British 
officer, who guessed our embarrassment, for we did not tell him (he came over with us on the ship), asked my hus 
band to draw on his banker until the letters of credit should arrive. It was a nice thing for a stranger to do.

We have never lost what we never had. We have never had any money only unlimited credit, for my husband's 
richest kind of a father insured us all manner of credit. It was all a mirage only at last, and it has gone just as we drew nigh to it.

Colonel Childs says eight of our Senators are for reconstruction, and that a ray of light has penetrated inward 
from <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a>, who told Judge Campbell that Southern land would not be confiscated.
