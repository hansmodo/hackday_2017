DEAR SIR, Inclosed are two newspapers, one of which contains the Eesolutions proposed at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a> and a letter 
from Bourdeaux, which is not uninteresting. You will find, 
also, two pieces, one from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">ALEXANDRIA</a>, and another answering 
it, which, as connected with the present crisis, may be worth 
reading. At Culpeper Court the proposed meeting took effect, 
General Stephens in the chair. The result, as stated to me, is 
not censurable, if at all, on the score surmised. It has not the 
smallest tincture of Anglomany or Aristocracy. I am informed 
that one of the Resolutions, which speaks of the attempts to 
alienate America from France in the past, as well as future 
time, was carried in the Committee, after considerable debate, 
and confirmed by the people on a motion to amend. The Resolutions in Fauquier are said to be a serv.e echo of those in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a>. When you come on, pray bring with you such of 
Davis' papers as may have been received since I left you. I 
send the little balance of tea due to Mrs. Monroe, which I intended, but failed, to procure before my late trip. As you are 
becoming a worshipper of Ceres, I add an ear of corn, which is 
forwarder, by three weeks, than the ordinary sort, and if given 
to your overseer, may supply a seasonable dish on your return 
next summer. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="friend colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a> is so delighted with it, that he not 
only requested me to forward some to Mr. Randolph, but took 
an ear with him, to be brought back on his return, that there 
might be no possible disappointment. Should you have an opportunity, after you know the day of your setting out, be so 
good as to drop me notice of it. My compliments to Mrs. 
Monroe.

Yrs, always and aff'ly.
