Probably the weather is gloomy enough. It rains half the week and every Sunday. I have not seen the inside of a church this three weeks. I hope it will not last long. The winter season has fairly begun here. We had a snow storm Saturday night. This is the gay season also, in the city and amusements of all kinds are plenty and cheap. We have seven theatres and an opera in full blast. Mr. Frey has got up an excellent company at the Astor Place House and the price to the upper circle is only 25¢. Cheap enough! to hear an orchestra of sixty performers and a chorus of eighty voices. We made up a party and went Monday night to hear Lucia. Madame Laborde and Benedetti sang it grandly and the orchestra is the best I ever heard. Ye Gods, such strains as they bring out. Enough to lift you off your seat out of this world. Talk about the Hutchinson family and these quartettes--they are 'nowhere.' I do enjoy music and shall take 25¢ worth occasionally. It is worth that to look at the
handsome women and their dresses. This is the headquarters of fashion and the fashion seems to be to stick as many flowers in the hair as possible and to get the dress as low in the neck as possible. Modesty can swallow anything that is fashion. When are you and I going to be able to hire a sofa there, Mary?

I am getting on bravely in dancing. I am taking lessons of Mr. Charaud and there are between sixty and seventy scholars. It is not as much fun as I anticipated, to stand up and be drilled for three hours. However, after the lesson is over we pair off and have a cotillion, all gentlemen of course. We learn the waltz and the polka, besides. 'Only think of the idea,' you will say, 'of Frank dancing the polka.' It is not as hard to learn as I imagined. We have eight soirees or assemblies during the winter to which we have the privilege of taking our lady friends, so I shall have dancing enough. I hope I shall come out polished but it's a rough subject, you know.

Well, Taylor is elected. Hurrah! I made a hat and a pair of gloves out of it and voted for him, too. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a> did nobly and so did Maine.

I am very much obliged to you for that cravat.
