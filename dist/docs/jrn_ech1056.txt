On Sunday last I attended a grand bullfight. The place in which the exhibition took place was a large circular pen, surrounded by a high fence, on one side of which was a large door opening to a small pen where the bulls were kept confined. About ten feet distant from this fence was a high wall
of canvas and still outside of this was a heavy brush fence to keep off interlopers and prevent those from seeing who were unwilling to pay their two dollars and fifty cents. The wide space between the canvas and the inner fence was filled up with rudely erected seats which were crowded with men and women, the former of all nations and the latter principally dark-eyed damsels of Spanish and Indian descent, dressed in their gayest holiday attire.

At three o'clock the performance commenced by admitting two Mexican horsemen gaudily attired and armed with long spears; then came three or four footmen, with red flags. They made their politest bows and after the band had played a lively air, the door opened and in bounded a large, wild bull. At first he made at the footmen but by quick manoeuvres they avoided his plunges. He then ran at the horsemen and for a time they kept him from doing any harm by piercing him with their long spears but they were not quick enough, for he soon knocked one of the horses down and his rider senseless. Immediately after the man fell he was removed by some of his companions, the bull's attention being attracted to one of the footmen with a red flag. The other rider was soon unhorsed and at one time the bull bid fair to become master of the ring.

At this stage of the performance, a dusky Mexican señorita, magnificently dressed, entered the arena, sword in hand. For a time she parried with the bull, pricking him slightly and stepping quickly to one side whenever he ran toward her. He soon became furious, roaring and tossing his horns high into the air and making the most formidable plunges at the lady until, at a favorable opportunity, she plunged the sword to the
hilt into the breast of the animal. She was sprinkled with crimson dye, and in a moment the beast lay dead at her feet. The lady was greeted with a shower of silver dollars and a shout of applause that made the welkin ring. She then retired. An intermission of a few minutes was now given until the dead bull could be removed from the arena.

Another large, wild bull was then let in, lassoed, thrown down, and fastened by a long rope, around one of his forelegs, to a ring in the middle of the pen. A huge grizzly bear was then brought in, in his cage, and after some considerable delay and trouble, was taken out and fastened in a similar manner with the bull. The bull was then let up and the men cleared the ring. Bruin lay quietly on his haunches and forelegs. After rising and looking around him the bull made a plunge at the bear, hitting him with one horn pretty forcibly in the breast. The bear then caught the bull by the nose with his mouth and by the neck with his paws, and thus they fought more than an hour, the bear biting off one of the bull's ears and tearing his nose, while he himself received sundry severe gorings. The animals were both considerably worried and seemed alike willing to give up the fight and it would be difficult to tell which would eventually have come out master of the field. Thus ended the afternoon's amusement.
