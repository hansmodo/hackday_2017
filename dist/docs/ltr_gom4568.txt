Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I did not receive your letter of the twelfth of August, until 
yesterday afternoon, or I should have made an earlier reply. 
</p><p>
I am very happy to find that you approve of the ground on 
which the interchange of ministers with this country was placed, 
and the judgment formed respecting the posts. I am led to 
fear, that my conduct in regard to our impressed seamen has 
not been equally fortunate ; but I hope the interference will 
be excused. Having no other guide, than my own sense of 
our interest and honor, it is not improbable that I may have 
missed my way. It was with much anxiety that I took any 
one of those steps, to which I found myself impelled. 
</p><p>
My letters to the President, subsequent to the month of May, 
will have communicated my conduct, and the opinion by which 
it was directed. I flatter myself, that on the subject of an alliance with this country, they will be found conformable to the 
sentiments which you express, and which will ever I hope govern the councils of our country. 
</p><p>
It was my good fortune also to anticipate your ideas respecting the designs of Britain upon the Spanish possessions, and 
therefore, whenever they mentioned to me the claims of Spain 
as highly interesting to us, I declared, (but as my private opinion only,) that we should view those claims of exclusive right 
with perfect indifference, from a conviction that it never would 
be exercised to our prejudice. This was with the double view 
of keeping up their disquietude about connexions, which we 
might form with Spain, and of preventing them from having 
any shadow of pretext to embroil us with that court hereafter, 
should the existing dispute be amicably adjusted. 
</p><p>
Before I dismiss this subject, indulge me with your pardon 
for hinting an idea, on which I have formed no decisive opinion, but which may perhaps merit some consideration. Spain, 
from the situation of France, the sense of her own weakness, 
and the effects of her late treaty with Britain, may, perhaps, 
wish for an effectual guarantee of her transatlantic dominions ; 
and perhaps she may deem that which we can give more important, than what Britain holds out. Perhaps she might incline 
to give something valuable for our friendship and protection.

The convention between Britain and Spain having been completed, and a bill for the government of Quebec being in 
agitation, I thought it might be well to pass a few days here, 
and therefore, having private business sufficient to prevent the 
drawing of any direct conclusions of a public nature, I came 
hither on Sunday, the twelfth instant. I made the needful 
inquiries respecting the Quebec system, and on the fourteenth 
called at Whitehall. The Duke of Leeds being absent, I left 
a card, and on the eighteenth paid his Grace another visit. 
The council was then breaking up, and as he had much to do, 
he sent Mr Burgess to me with an apology. This gentleman 
gave me a deal of civil nothingness 5 was glad that our difficulties about the impress were at an end ; had during my absence 
received frequent applications from Mr Cutting, and, in consequence of what passed between us, had paid every attention to 
them. Administration had every desire I could wish for treaty. 
Many cabinet councils had been held upon it. A great many 
difficulties had arisen in fixing on- the persons to whom the 
management should be committed. This matter, however, was 
adjusted. A reference had been made above three months 
since to Lord Hawkesbury. His Lordship very diligent, but 
his report not yet made. When received, no time would be 
lost in setting all the different engines at work. Hoped we 
should soon have residents with each other, &ic. &tc. &c. I 
heard him quietly out, and then replied, that I was sorry to 
have interrupted his attention to other affairs. Having been 
called by private business to London, I thought it my duty to 
let them know I was alive. If his Grace wished to see me, I 
would wait on him at such time as he might indicate ; that my 
stay here would be short ; that I should write to America before 
my departure, and if I learnt nothing more than that things remained in the same state of uncertainty in which I had left them 
I should say so. It was for them and not for me to consider 
what consequences delay might produce to the British commerce. 
</p><p>
The reputation of the United States rises fast ; and although 
our enemies make objections to the funding system^ yet that 
</p><p>
step towards the establishment of public credit has produced a 
sensible effect on those opinions, which no administration will 
wholly disregard. I am, &c.
