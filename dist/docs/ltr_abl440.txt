MAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER.
</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR:--The recent movement of your army is ended without
effecting its object, except, perhaps, some important breakings of
the enemy's communications. What next? If possible, I would be very
glad of another movement early enough to give us some benefit from
the fact of the enemy's communication being broken; but neither for
this reason nor any other do I wish anything done in desperation or
rashness. An early movement would also help to supersede the bad
moral effect of there certain, which is said to be considerably
injurious. Have you already in your mind a plan wholly or partially
formed? If you have, prosecute it without interference from me. If
you have not, please inform me, so that I, incompetent as I may be,
can try and assist in the formation of some plan for the army.
</p>
Yours as ever,
<a href="/results.php?tla=abl" rel="me">A. LINCOLN.</a>
