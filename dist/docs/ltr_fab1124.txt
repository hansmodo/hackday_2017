I have just finished my letter to Father. I send this by Captain Moody, who goes to Belfast direct, to-morrow. So if you get it you will be lucky.

Saw John Benson today. Ed is commisary for the troops fighting the Indians. Saw Mr. Frazer, our passenger. He is going to buy a vessel and going back to the Marquesas. He wants to colonize one of the islands and wants me to go with him and spend a year at least. He is going to introduce coffee and sugar cane. I think they both might be cultivated there to advantage. A white man with a little tact might do anything with the natives and live like a monarch. Old Frazer is rich and if he will give me a good chance, I don't know but what I may be induced to go. Still I want a vessel of my own and go on my own account and then I have a cruise shaped out. But all in good time, dear Mary.

'Aloha'--love to you, as the Vahines say.
