MY DEAR SISTER, We are in excellent lodgings on Sansom Street, and I feel 
like another being. Dr. Physic has put my knee in splints and promises me a 
cure in time. I have the world to see me, and many invitations to the houses of the 
gentry, but withstand all, to be at ease here. I have not seen where I am, yet, 
and the longer I stay, the less do the vanities tempt me, though, as you know, I 
usually like the routs all too well. You ask who is kindest to me here, and I can 
tell you that, among a number, Betsey Pemberton bears off the palm. Never 
can I forget Betsey, who has been to me what you would have been. I have had a 
lecture from S. L. on seeing too much company, and it brought to my mind the 
time when our society used to control me entirely, and debar me from so many ad 
vantages and pleasures ; even now, I feel my ancient terror revive in a great degree. 
Madison is well, though besieged with callers ; he sends his love to you both, as I do. 
</p><p>
Ever your devoted <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=dol" rel="me">DOLLY </a>.
