Dear <a href="results.php?tla=mjpe" rel="spouse">J.P.</a><p>

Hope you will excuse the pencil but I can't find my pen - didn't look downstairs cause I was afraid the <a href="results.php?tla=hok" rel="parent">folks</a> were asleep.

Boy - am I ever excited! Have landed a job in Palo Alto in the kind of place I've always  wanted to work in. It's a very nice shop with a good [unintelligible] and [unintelligible]. The [unintelligible] is better than most places with good prices it will be easy to double and then 50% of what I take in. Of course it will be rather  slow at first as I'm new in the shop but Desta - the owner - is a good person and very nice to work for. I went to work on Tuesday and found out for sure this evening that I was hired. I quit the other job Monday after this was line up. I will probably move to Palo Alto - may room with Hazel Scott - remember her she is secretary to the Chief of Police there and has a nice apartment by herself. I never thought much of her until lately and have grown to like her very much. Guess as you grow older you change - yes I have a lot and so has she. Both for the better - maybe you wouldn't think so though.
<p>
I can imagine how hard letters are to write but was awfully glad to hear from you again. You know I've always thought a lot of you and it gives one the creeps rather to know you are in the war zone.
<p>
Thought I told you but guess I forgot. Zack is on the Sunnyvale Police force. Has been for 1 1/2 years now. He's a good cop and is very serious about his duties. They are expecting another baby in August and are terribly happy.

I had a few days off work several weeks ago and went up to Vallejo for 2 days. Stayed with Betty and Vernon. We made the rounds one evening - what rounds there are up there. The ship Vernon was on when in the Navy was in and 2 of his friends came over. They had just come from Pearl Harbor.
<p>
<a href="results.php?tla=ltc" rel="sibling">Lois</a> and <a href="results.php?tla=mrc" rel="kin">Mark</a> are still in Washington. Mark is doing desk work and hates it but I guess someone has to do it.
<p>
I got quite a few new clothes and do I ever feel ritzy! It's been ages since I've had much of anything and if I keep on working in Palo Alto I may have to get more. If I hadn't looked pretty nice I'm sure I wouldn't have had a chance at my new job.
<p>
Yes - I can talk a lot more than I used to - really amazes me at times. Do you still talk double? Or am I crazy?
<p>
How is your <a href="results.php?tla=ebe" rel="kin">mother</a> J.P.? Also what is your <a href="results.php?tla=dse" rel="kin">brother</a> doing now?
<p>
The Navy is just about to take over <a href="http://www.moffettfieldmuseum.org/" rel="tag">Moffet</a> now.
<p>
The house <a href="results.php?tla=hok" rel="kin">Horace</a> is building is just about finished and is quite nice. He kids me all the time about finding a truck driver and moving in. High aspirations eh?
<p>
Well the darned  Sunday Evening Club is meeting here next Sunday, then I'm through. I'm supposed to tell them about singing! Lord only knows what I'll do!
<p>
Tis enough of this rambling -<br>
Bye now.<br>
Sincerely yours,<br>
