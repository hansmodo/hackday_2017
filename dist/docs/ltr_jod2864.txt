You will sec, by the newspapers, which I, from time 
to time, enclose, with what rapidity the colonies proceed in their political manoeuvres. How many calamities might have been avoided, if these measures 
had been taken twelve months ago, or even no longer ago than last December ? 
</p><p>
The colonies to the south are pursuing the sai 
maxims which have heretofore governed those to the 
north. In constituting their new governments, their 
plans are remarkably popular, more so than I could 
over have imagined ; even more popular than the 
" Thoughts on Government ; " and in the choice of 
their rulers, capacity, spirit, and zeal in the cause 
supply the place of fortune, family, and every other 
consideration which used to have weight with man 
kind. My friend Archibald Bullock, Esquire, is Governor of Georgia. John Rutledge, Esquire, is Governor 
of South Carolina. Patrick Henry, Esquire, is Governor of Virginia, &c. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="met colleague">Dr. Franklin</a> will be Governor of 
Pennsylvania. The now members of this city are all 
in this taste, chosen because of their inflexible zeal for 
independence. All the old members left out because 
they opposed independence, or at least were luke 
warm about it. Dickinson, Morris, Allen, all fallen, 
like grass before the scythe, notwithstanding all their vast advantages in point of fortune, family and abilities. I am inclined to think, however, and to wish that these gentlemen may be restored at a fresh election, because, although mistaken in some points, they 
are good characters, and their great wealth and numerous connexions will contribute to strengthen America, and cement her union. 
</p><p>
I wish I were at perfect liberty to portray before 
you all these characters in their genuine lights, and 
to explain to you the course of political changes in 
this province. It would give you a great idea of the 
spirit and resolution of the people, and sh jw you, in a 
striking point of view, the deep roots of American in 
dependence in all the colonies. But it is not prudent 
to commit to writing such free speculations in the 
present state of things. Time, which takes away the 
veil, may lay open the secret springs of this surprising 
revolution. But I find, although the colonies have differed in religion, laws, customs and manners, yet 
in the great essentials of society and government, they are all alike.
