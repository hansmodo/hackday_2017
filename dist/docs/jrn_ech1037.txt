We have moved our camp about three miles and are now encamped on the Calaveras River, a small stream. Leaving his teams and family
here, Mr. Cox took his horses and started with Mr. Reed up to visit the Stanislaus Diggings, to find which is the best location to go to for mining purposes. I thought that when they returned and made their report, I should know better what to do; if it was favorable, I would go to the southern mines, and if otherwise, wend my way northward. I walked into the city on Monday morning, hoping to get a job at printing or anything else, but found none. Business is very dull here.
<p></p>
Next morning, in company with Mr. Hilliard, I crossed the Calaveras, paying 50 cents for being carried over. We looked out for a fine lot of grass for the purpose of making hay. Mr. Hilliard found a place where he went to work on the morrow. We found several parties mowing, with one of which I engaged to work at five dollars per day and found. On Wednesday morning I went to work mowing and worked until after sunset, then eat supper, and made a bed of hay and turned in. It proved the softest I have slept in since I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. In the morning I again went to work but felt too ill to continue at it later than ten o'clock, when I quit and came home to camp. Mr. Cox has returned from the mines with an unfavorable report.

Feeling pretty well this morning, I walked into town in hopes of finding something to do, or purchase a scythe on credit. In the latter I was entirely unsuccessful. Scythes ready rigged for cutting grass are now bringing from forty to sixty dollars and this is considered reasonable as they sold for seventy-five and eighty dollars two weeks since. But in the former I was rather more fortunate inasmuch as one of the
proprietors of the Stockton Times told me to come to work on Tuesday, as he wished to hire help three or four days next week, and intimated that it might prove a permanent position for me. I agreed to come at the appointed time and returned to camp with rather less weight upon my mind than I had done for several days. The express from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> came in but brought nothing for any of us. I mailed a letter to the proprietors of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> Herald, a new paper about to be started at that place, making application for a situation.
