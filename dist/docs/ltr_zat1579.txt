My dear Dr 
</p><p>
I wrote you by the last mail which left here a week since, in reply to 
your several letters of the j d & 6 th ult as well as I recollect the dates 
which I hope will reach you in safety & in due season since when we have 
had no mail from the U. States, their arrival having been quite uncertain 
& far between for some time past. I am now busily preparing to leave 
for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoros" rel="city">Matamoros</a> & expect to do so on the 8th  ins t which place I hope to 
reach should nothing occur to prevent it, by the i8 th or 2O th where I 
intend remaining until I hear the result of my application made some four 
weeks since to the proper department in Washington for permission to 
leave the country, which if acted on promtly I ought at any to receive an 
answer by the 25th  & if favorable, I will turn over the command of this 
line to Gen Wool, who is now here, & will accompany me to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a>, 
& perhaps to Brazos, & after doing so will leave there in the first good 
vessel for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a>, where I hope to be by the first of December or 
soon after A report has reached here that President Polk was dead, 
which, I do not credit, while I regret to hear of the death of any one, I 
would as soon have heard of his death if true, as that of any other individual in the whole Union, evun should it have the effect of producing 
great changes in measures as well as men, so far as the management of 
national affairs are concerned ; as they may be bettered & cannot possibly 
be worsted ; but it may have the effect of producing some chang & confusion at Washington, which may have the effect of causing my application 
to be laid over for a short time ; but whether he is dead or alive, I apprehend there will be no difficulty about said leave, other than delay for want 
of attention, as those in power of said party be they whom they may, will 
be very much pleased to get me out of Mexico, if not out of the world 
</p><p>
We have heard nothing as yet directly from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> since he took 
possession of the City of Mexico ; we learn indirectly from Mexicans, he 
is in quiet possession of the same, & that Santa Anna had been removed 
from the command of the Mexican army, which had been dispersed, or 
as they express it, had been thrown out of the combat ; whether there is 
anything like a peace even in prospect, I am unable to say ; the best 
informed Mexicans in this section of the country, with whom I have con 
versed, say there will be no peace ; that eleven of the states of Mexico 
had united to carry on the war in the best way they could; if so & Mr 
Trist negotiates a treaty it will be on the Schemerhorn plan, with an irresponsible faction or party 
</p><p>
I sincerely hope the dreadful fever has passed away & that the city & 
vicinity has become once more healthy, & has left you in the enjoyment of 
the same health as when you last wrote ; when I can know this is the case, 
I will be greatly relieved on your account 
</p><p>
I also flatter myself that Mr s Taylor Ann &c have been able to return 
home without experiencing any inconvenience from doing, as they must by 
the time they left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Pascagoula" rel="city">Pascagoula</a> been heartily tired of the place if not before 
</p><p>
The robbers are still infesting the road between this & Rio Grande ; 
L r Campbell coming here from Cerralvo with 20 men of the 2 d Dragoons 
& a few Texan Rangers was attacked this morning about fifteen miles 
from here by about 150 of that description of people, & after a very sharp 
contest he was barely able to force his way through them, with the loss of 
four men killed & several wounded; & alth a large command was on the 
ground in a few hours after the attack was made there was a reenforcement on the ground of 100 Dragoons yet dispersing through a country 
unknown to us and were able to effect their escape, or to keep out of our 
way This is the description of warfare which will be carried on for the 
time to come in Mexico 
</p><p>
My love to Ann & the girls as well as kindest regards to the boys 
when you write them, & wishing you & yours continued health & pros 
perity I remain 
</p><p>
Truly & Sincerely 
</p><p>
Your Friend

I had but a few moments to write you, as I waited till the last moment 
hoping a mail would arrive, but have done so to no purpose.
