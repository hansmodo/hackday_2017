DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived here yesterday, at noon, and waited upon 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> immediately, on the business of my 
mission ; but was sorry to find his ideas did not correspond with yours for drawing off the number of 
troops you directed. I used every argument in my 
power to convince him of the propriety of the measure ; but he was inflexible in the opinion, that two 
brigades, at least, of Continental troops should remain 
in and near this place. His reasons were, that the 
intelligence of Sir Henry Clinton's having gone to 
join Burgoyne was not sufficiently authenticated to 
put it out of doubt ; that there was, therefore, a possibility of his returning up the river, which might ex 
pose the finest arsenal in America (as he calls the 
one here) to destruction, should this place be left so 
bare of troops as I proposed ; and that the want of 
conveniences, and the difficulty of the roads, would 
make it impossible to remove the artillery and stores 
here for a considerable time ; that the New England 
States would be left open to the depredations and 
ravages of the enemy; that it would put it out of 
his power to enterprise any thing against <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, which, he thinks, might be done in the winter, 
and which he considers it of importance to under 
take. 
</p><p>
The force of the reasons did by no means strike 
me, and I did every thing in my power to show 
they were unsubstantial; but all I could effect, was 
to have one brigade despatched, in addition to those 
already marched. I found myself infinitely embarrassed, and was at a loss how to act. I felt the importance of strengthening you as much as possible ; 
but, on the other hand, I found insuperable inconveniences in acting diametrically opposite to the 
opinion of a gentleman, whose successes have raised 
him into the highest importance. <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> has 
won the entire confidence of the Eastern States. If 
disposed to do it, by addressing himself to the prejudices of the people, he would find no difficulty to 
render a measure odious, which, it might be said 
with plausibility enough to be believed, was calculated to expose them to unnecessary danger, notwithstanding their exertions during the campaign had 
given them the fullest title to repose and security. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> has influence and interest elsewhere ; 
he might use it, if he pleased, to discredit the measure there also. On the whole, it appeared to me 
dangerous to insist on sending more troops from 
hence, while <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> appeared so warmly op 
posed to it. Should any accident or inconvenience 
happen in consequence of it, there would be too fair a pretext for censure ; and many people are too w^ell 
disposed to lay hold of it. At any rate, it might be 
considered as using him ill, to take a step so contrary to his judgment^ in a case of this nature. 
</p><p>
These considerations, and others which I shall be 
more explicit in, when I have the pleasure of seeing 
you, determined me not to insist upon sending either 
of the other brigades remaining here. I am afraid 
what I have done may not meet with your approbation, as not being, perhaps, fully warranted by 
your instructions ; but I ventured to do what I 
thought right, hoping that, at least, the goodness of 
my intention will excuse the error of my judgment. 
</p><p>
I was induced to this relaxation the more readily, 
as I had directed to be sent on two thousand militia, 
which were not expected by you, and a thousand 
Continental troops out of those proposed to be left 
with <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a>, which I have written to him, 
since I found how matters were circumstanced here. 
to forward to you with all despatch. I did this for 
several reasons; because your reinforcement would 
be more expeditious from that place than from this; 
because two thousand Continental troops at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> 
will not be wanted, in the present circumstances, 
especially as it was really necessary to have a body 
of Continental troops at this place for the security 
of the valuable stores here ; and I should not, if I 
had my wish, think it expedient to draw off more 
than two of the three brigades now here. This being 
the case, one of the ends you proposed to be answered by leaving the ten regiments with General 
Putnam, will be equally answered by the troops here ; 
I mean that of covering and satisfying the Eastern 
States ; and one thousand Continental troops, in addition to the militia collected and that may be collected there, will be sufficient in the Highlands for 
covering the country down that way, and carrying 
on the works necessary to be raised for the defence 
of the river. 
</p><p>
The troops gone, and going, to reenforce you, are 
near five thousand, rank and file, Continental troops, 
and twenty-five hundred Massachusetts and New Hampshire militia. These, and the seven hundred Jersey 
militia, will be a larger reinforcement than you expected, though not quite an equal number of Continental troops, nor exactly in the way directed. <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague met'>General Lincoln</a> tells me the militia are very excellent; 
and though their times will be out by the last of 
this month, you will be able, if you think proper, to 
order the troops still remaining here, to join you by 
the time their term of service expires. 
</p><p>
I cannot forbear being uneasy lest my conduct 
should prove displeasing to you; but I have done what, considering all circumstances, appeared to me 
most eligible and prudent. I have the honor to be. 
with great esteem and respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">ALEXANDER HAMILTON</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Vessels are preparing to carry the brigade to <a href='/results.php?city=new windsor' rel='city'>New Windsor</a>, which will embark this evening. 
I shall, this afternoon, set out on my return to camp, 
and, on my way, shall endeavour to hasten the troops 
forward.
