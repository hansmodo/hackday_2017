Dear Brother : . . . While in Ohio I heard a great 
deal of politics, and chiefly about the nomination for the 
Presidency. It is certain that if Elaine is not nominated 
in the early ballots a movement will be made for your 
nomination, and if entered upon will go like wild fire. 
Some one should be authorized to make a definite and 
positive refusal if you have concluded to decline the 
nomination if tendered. My own opinion is still that 
while you ought not to seek, or even beforehand consent, 
to accept a nomination, yet if it comes unsought and 
with cordial unanimity you ought to acquiesce. I believe it would be best for the country, honorable to you 
and your children, and far less irksome than you have 
thought. It would be the safe result of what is like to 
be a severe contest. ... If desired by me I could have 
the solid vote of Ohio, but I see no prospect or possibility of my nomination, and not much of my election if 
nominated, but yours is easy. Elaine could readily 
turn his strength to you if he cannot get a majority, and 
I think means to do so. All well here. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
