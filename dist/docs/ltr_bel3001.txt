DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Agreeably to your Excellency's orders, I waited 
upon <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, on my way to the militia 
who had assembled and were assembling at Manchester, on the Grants, received his instructions, and met 
the troops the 2d instant. I found only five or six 
hundred there; but one regiment was on the road 
from the Massachusetts, and about thirteen or fourteen 
hundred from New Hampshire. Before many of them 
arrived, I received <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>'s orders to join 
him, with all the troops excepting one small regiment. Part of them began their march yesterday; 
the remainder were to leave the Grants this day. The 
army here is to take post upon a small island in the 
Mohawk River, where it unites with the Hudson. 
That post is supposed to be more favorable than the 
one now occupied by them. 
</p><p>
I am to return with the militia from the Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and the Grants, to the 
northward, with a design to fall into the rear of Burgoyne, who, from the best information we can obtain, 
hath left a very naked and uncovered rear, and, if 
possible, cut off his communication with the Lakes. 
This movement, probably, will cause him to reenforce 
the several posts of which he hath possessed himself, 
and which, at all hazards, he must attempt to maintain, or induce him to make a detachment with a 
view to attack us. In either case, it will greatly 
weaken his main body, and may give the force here 
an opportunity to act against them with success. The 
Massachusetts, I hear, have ordered out two thousand 
of their militia. From the best accounts we can obtain, the enemy are not more than six thousand strong. 
If Burgoyne falls down into the country this way, I 
see nothing but he must be ruined, unless supported 
by General Howe, which, by his movements, he undoubtedly expects. 
</p><p>
I am happy to inform your Excellency, that I now 
enjoy my usual good state of health. I am, dear 
General, with sincere regard and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
