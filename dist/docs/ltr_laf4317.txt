]\Iy DEAR General, 
</p><p>
I wish it was in my power to give you an assurance, that our troubles are at an end, and our Constitution totally established. But, although dark clouds 
are still before us. we come so far as to foresee the 
momeut when a Legislative corps will succeed this 
Convention ; and unless foreign powers interfere, I 
hope that within four months your friend will have 
reassumed the life of a private and quiet citizen. 
</p><p>
The rage of parties, even among the patriots, is 
gone as far as it is possible, short of bloodshed ; but, 
although hatreds are far from subsiding, matters do 
not appear so ill disposed as they formerly were towards a collision among the supporters of the popular 
cause. I myself am exposed to the envy and attacks 
of all parties, for this simple reason, that, whoever 
acts or means wrong, finds me an insuperable obstacle ; 
and there appears a kind of phenomenon in my situation ; all parties against me, and a national popularity 
which, in spite of every effort, has been unshakable. 
A proof of this I had lately, when disobeyed by the 
guard, and unsupported by the administrative powers 
who had sent me, unnoticed by the National Assembly, who had taken fright. The King I do not mention, as he could do but little in the affair, and yet 
the little he did was against me. Given up to all 
the madness of license, faction, and popular rage, I 
stood alone in defence of the law, and turned the 
tide up into the Constitutional channel. 
</p><p>
I hope this lesson will serve my country, and help towards establishing the principles of good order. 
But, before I could bring my fellow-citizens to a sense of legal subordination, I must have conducted them 
through the fear to lose the man they love. Inclosed is the speech I delivered on the occasion. I send it, 
not for any merit of it, but on account of the great effect it had on the minds of the people, and the 
discipline of an army of five-and-forty thousand men; upward of thirty [thousand] of them are volunteers ; 
and who, to a man, are exposed to all the suggestions of a dozen of parties, and the corruptions of all kinds of pleasure and allurement. 
</p><p>
The Committee of Revision is going to distinguish, 
in our immense materials, every article that deserves 
to be constitutional; and as I hope to convene, in a 
tolerable state of union, the members of that Committee, as their votes will in the House influence the 
popular part of the Assembly, I hope that, besides 
the restoration of all natural rights, the destruction 
of all abuses, we may present to the nation some 
very good institutions of government, and organize 
it so as to ensure to the people the principal consequences and enjoyments of a free Constitution, leaving the remainder to the Legislative corps to mend 
into well digested bills, and waiting until experience 
has fitted us for a more enlightened and less agitated 
National Convention. 
</p><p>
In the mean while, our principles of liberty and 
equality are invading all Europe, and popular revolutions preparing everywhere. Should foreign powers 
employ this summer with attacks against our Constitution, there wiU be great bloodshed; but our liberty 
cannot fail us. We have done every thing for the 
general class of the country people ; and, in case the 
cities were frightened into submission, yet the peasants would swarm round us and fight to death, rather 
than give up their rights. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my beloved General. My best respects wait on Mrs. Washington. Remember me to Hamilton, 
Jay, Jefferson, Knox, and all friends. Most respectfully and affectionately I am, my dear General, 
</p><p>
Your filial friend,
