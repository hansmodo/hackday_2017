SALT LAKE CITY, September 27th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1869">1869</a>.
</p><p>
The stage-route by which we came from Uintah to this "much married" city, winds along the base of the mountains which encircle this great valley, as if to guard it from the profane intrusion of the outside world. The dark blue waters of Salt Lake slumbered calmly on our right, and occupy a central position in the valley. It is about seventy-five miles long by ten wide. In its centre there looms up a mountain island, which gleams like an emerald set in ebony. Its outline is oval. The extensive meadow-like plains that border on the Lake are rich and beautiful, and divided into ranches occupied for the most part by Mormons. The margin of the Lake is encrusted with crystalized salt of excellent quality, which the people here generally use for domestic purposes, and which any one may shovel up and carry away by the wagon load, if he cares to do
so. In other words, here are Nature's salt works.

In passing around the spur of a mountain as we approached the city, we drove through the rapid current of a hot spring flowing from the mountain's base, and steaming with offensive gases, and so heated that you could not hold your hand in it. Its volume is quite large, almost a rivulet, and its waters are said to be highly esteemed for their medicinal properties. Springs of a like character abound still nearer the city, and even within its limits, where several bathing houses have been erected to which Brigham and his disciples often resort and undergo ablutions which, I doubt not, they much need; and yet I question whether the waters, though heated to a scald, could cleanse them from their moral leprosy.

Near the city, and along the roadside, are still to be seen the dilapidated walls of several old fortifications, black as tar, and originally built ten or twelve feet high, enclosing plats of ground broad enough to accommodate an army of ten thousand men. The walls are one continuous solid mass, and appear to be constructed of cement made of gravel and asphaltum, impenetrable to musket balls. The Mormons erected these walls in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1857">1857</a>, as we were told, for the purpose of defending the Holy City against the crusade of the Federal troops, then in command of Gen.
Jonnson, who had been sent to Utah by the Government with orders to see that the laws of Congress were duly enforced.

Very soon after passing the fortifications we entered the city proper, and took lodgings at a Mormon hotel. Here we found excellent accommodations, and during our stay were treated with all the attention and politeness we could desire. We observed nothing, while at the hotel, which induced us to believe that it differed in any respect from other first class hotels; and yet, as a matter of fact, our landlord rejoiced in the possession of five wives, if joy there can be in having five times too much of a good thing. The first wife was, apparently, past middle age, wore a faded calico dress and a downcast look, and seemed unhappy. The second appeared much younger and prettier, was clad in silks and jewels, and had the general superintendence of the servants and of the household. The other three, it was said, kept house by themselves in different parts of the town, and took charge of their own children and family affairs; yet were, in fact, supported by the landlord, their common husband. How many children he has by his five wives, we did not learn, but they are said to be numerous. He is regarded as a man of wealth, and in his style of manners has the appearance of an
accomplished gentleman. He is a native of Maine; apparently about sixty years old, and has resided in Salt Lake City twenty years.

On Sunday we attended church, and heard Brigham Young preach. He had a full house, and appeared to be a man of much more polish and culture than I expected to see, from all I had heard said of him. His language was select, and his style of oratory earnest, talkative and sincere. He indulged in no expressions which could be regarded as inconsistent with good taste; yet when contradicted or irritated, it is said, he sometimes employs coarse and unqualified language. He evidently feels and knows that he is the acknowledged dictator and Supreme Head of the Church in Mormondom. It must be admitted that he is a shrewd tactician, decidedly foxy, and ever ready in adopting expedients. If this were not so, he could never have achieved what he has. If not a great genius, he is certainly no ordinary man. This was my impression of him at first sight. His discourse was not written, nor did he take a text, but proceeded at once to give utterance to his train of thought. If I had not known who he was, I should not have questioned the orthodoxy of his discourse, until he alluded to the subject of polygamy. In this allusion he pronounced it a divine institution, and then
remarked that the outside world called it his "peculiar institution." He said there was really nothing peculiar about it, and declared that polygamy was sanctioned by both the Old and New Testament, as well as by the present customs of mankind in various parts of the civilized world. He also declared the Book of Mormon, a Divine Revelation, because he knew it to be such, asserting that the "Latter Day Saints" are the only true chosen people of God. He said all other systems of religion had failed in their object, and that the new revelation became a necessity, and is therefore the true "light of the world." He called Christ his elder brother, and claimed the power of working miracles. In conclusion, he appealed to the women to be submissive to their condition, and urged this as a religious duty. He told them that God destined them to become the mothers of mankind, and that they were made wives and mothers in the providence of God, for the purpose of building up Zion for "Zion's sake."

In personal appearance, Brigham is a fine looking gentleman, tall and portly, easy and selfpossessed in manner, dresses elegantly, is about seventy years of age, yet appears much younger, and weighs at least two hundred. He has more wives than pounds of flesh. If distributed
among them, he wouldn't go round at a pound apiece. He has wives celestial and wives terrestial. Of the celestial there are several hundred; of the terrestial some forty or fifty. The former are pious, confiding old ladies, who have lost their charms, and only claim the privilege of pinning their faith to his sleeve. The latter are still possessed of considerable youth and beauty, and have the privilege of "building up Zion." How many children Brigham really has, is not known, and it is doubtful if he knows; but they say he has somewhere from fifty to one hundred and fifty. In providing for their education, he erected especially for them a large two-story school house, which has now become too small to accommodate them. He has nineteen or twenty favorite wives, who occupy distinct dwellings in different parts of the city. He visits them occasionally, and so far as they are unable to take care of themselves, he provides for them. The salvation of every woman who marries Brigham or any of his church dignitaries, is considered absolutely certain. Hence, their system of celestial marriages embraces old women as well as young, and often women who have been in their graves for years. The nuptial ceremonies are performed in church. In marrying a deceased woman, the bridegroom appears before
the priest, locked arm in arm with a living wife, who consents to the nuptials, as the representative of the invisible bride; in this way the departed woman is sealed to an earthly husband in celestial marriage. The faithful, especially the widows, believe in celestial marriages; and of course are all anxious to secure their salvation by becoming sealed as celestial wives to Brigham, or to some one of his divine officials in the church. The Mormons claim that all within the pale of their church are brothers and sisters in a natural as well as spiritual sense, and therefore hold, that intermarriages without regard to the degree of consanguinity are in perfect accordance with the dictates of God and Nature. While we were in the city, a brother married his sister, as we were credibly informed.

The priesthood go so far as to say that father and daughter, mother and son, may, without violating either natural or divine law, intermarry, if they choose. Such is polygamy in its tendency and in its most revolting form. Is there no remedy? The time is rapidly approaching, I trust, when this corroding stain, this foul plague-spot on our national escutcheon, will be forever obliterated, and that too, without the hope of a resurrection. And yet what can be done, or what will be done, remains to be seen.
