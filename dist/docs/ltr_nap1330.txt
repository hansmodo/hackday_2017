ON BOARD STEAMBOAT SIAM  11  March 15, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1836">1836</a>
</p><p>
DEAR, DEAR MOTHER: Your proposal concerning keeping a diary as I journey comes before my mind often. I have not found it practicable while traveling by land, although many events have passed which, if noted as they occurred, might have been interesting. We left Pittsburgh this morning at ten o'clock, and are sailing at the rate of thirteen miles an hour. It is delightful passing so rapidly down the waters of the beautiful river. The motion of the boat is very agreeable to me, except while writing. Our accommodations are good; we occupy a stateroom where we can be as retired as we wish. Two boats left Pittsburgh before we did, but they are now in our rear. The captain of one of them became very angry because we attempted to pass, and shot into our path before us. For a time we thought injury would be done by their coming in contact, but we passed her unhurt. The Siam was a very strong boat, and might have sunk the other without much difficulty. It is an imposing scene to see the march of these stately figures as they pass us on the waters. Some are very large, and are swarming with inhabitants. It has been quite pleasant to-day, but too cold to be on deck much of the time. We have seen no snow since we left the Allegheny mountains.
</p><p>
MARCH 28. We have just come on board the Majestic. It is rightly named, for it is one of the largest boats on the river. We are now sailing on the waters of the great Mississippi. When I commenced this sheet we had just left Pittsburgh. We arrived in Cincinnati Thursday noon. Found Brother Spalding. Said he had been waiting for us anxiously for a fortnight; spent the remainder of the week in making arrangements for our journey, and on the Sabbath had a very interesting time with the disciples of Jesus there; felt strengthened and comforted as we left them, to pursue our journey into the wilderness.
</p><p>
Much good feeling was manifested in the churches -- a deep interest appeared to be taken in the missions. Especially our two Indian youths attracted the gaze and admiration of a crowd on Sabbath evening. You will probably hear from us through the Rev. Mr. Norton, who promised to write Brother Hall. Miss Matthews teacher in the colored school, promises to write to Jane. We left Tuesday noon in the Junius and expected to arrive in St. Louis before the Sab. but our expectations were not realized, and Sat. night found us on the waters of the Mississipi eighty-nine miles from St. Louis. We felt it our duty not to travel on the Sab. and determined to leave the boat altho many on board tryed to persuade us to remain and have preaching on the Sab, and of the number one was a Presbyterian minister from New York who appeared quite anxious to detain us. At ten o'clock we landed at Chester, Illinois, and had a most delightful Sab. of rest with the few disciples of Jesus we found there. An aged minister who had been toiling in this part of the vineyard ever since the year 1817, we found of a kindred spirit. He preaches to several congregations. Said he had not had a brother minister to preach for him since had been there. And to have a mission family call and enjoy the privileges of the Sab. with him seemed like angels' visits. He had heard of their passing often. Mr. Spalding preached in the forenoon, and in the afternoon my Husband requested the children and youth to meet in a Sab. School and we distributed a number of books among them. Of the number we found one young man who professed to be a Roman C. but said he wanted to know our religion, had not a Protestant Bible but if he had one would read it attentively. My husband gave him a Testament for which he appeared greatful [Sic].

Since we came on board we have come on very pleasantly, our accommodations are better here than on any previous boat, excellent cooks, and enough to eat. Servants, who stand at our elbows ready to supply every want. Five o'clock, we are now fast upon a sand bar, but think we shall soon get off. It has rained all day, a dense fog covers the river so that it is impossible to shun them. We shall be obliged to lie still to night.
</p><p>
29. TUES morn, fog very thick this morn but now appears to be disappearing. We shall expect to see St. Louis today. Cold and damp today and am obliged to stay in my room, can scarcely resist the temptation of standing out to view the shores of this majestic river. Varied scenes present themselves as we pass up, beautiful landscapes, on the one side high and rugged bluffs, and on the other low plains. Eve. We are now in port. Husband has been to the Office expecting to find
</p><p>
letters from dear dear friends at home but find none. Why have they not written, seeing it is the very last, last time they will have to cheer my heart with intelligence from home, home, sweet home, and the friends I love. But I am not sad. My health is good. My mind completely occupied with present duty and passing events. St. Louis has a commanding situation. It is so late and foggy our view of it as we came in is quite indistinct.
</p><p>
WEDNESDAY 30. A boat is in port ready to take us up the Missouri and will leave to day. I intended to write several letters from here, expecting to spend some time, but as we made our purchases at Cincinnati, it is not necessary. When we were in Pittsburgh we heard that the Fur Com. Steam boat Dinnah had left St. Louis. We then expected [to] make our journey from Liberty to Bellview by land probably on horseback 300 miles which would have been the most difficult part of the journey on account of the season and high water. But providence has ordered it otherwise. Since we have arrived here we learn that the Dinnah snagged herself and sunk but in shallow water so that no lives were lost. We have the promise of overtaking her before we reach Liberty. She is now lying up for repairs and drying her freight. We had a call this morn from a gentleman who has resided in the mountains. Richard knew him very well, is going back with us. He was formerly from Cin. It seems to me now that we are on the very borders of civilization. Altho we shall pass many towns on our way to Liberty. At this moment my feelings are peculiar. I hardly know how to define them. I have not one feeling of regret at the step which I have taken but count it a privilege to go forth in the name of my Master cheerfully bearing the toil and privation that we expect to encounter. I intend to write home from Council Bluff if I am not prevented, and give some statements which I cannot now. We could not pack all contained [in] that box sent us from Angelica. What we could not, Brother Whitman took home to sell for us and send the avails to us to St. Louis. How anxiously I look for a line or two from some one of the dear family in that box some where but I saw none. Jane, don't
forget to write to them for me. It is out of my power to write as much as I should like too. How often I think of the Christians in Angelica, those beloved sisters and brothers with whom we have knelt before the altar of prayer. Surely now I feel the influence of their prayers altho widely separated. Say to them we wish them to rejoice with us and thank Cod for his kind protection and the prosperity which has attended us since we left home. We are making arrangements for crossing the mountains and shall expect to unless prevented in the Providence of God. I think I should like to whisper in Mother's ear many things which I cannot write. If I could only see her in her room for one half hour. This much, Dear Mother, I have one of the kindest Husbands and the very best every way. Tell Father by the side of his calomile he has taken a quarter of a pound of lobelia and a large quantity of Cayenne which will answer my purpose better than some of the apothecary medicines.
</p><p>
My Husband unites with me in sending a great deal of love to dear friends there G. and . . .  J.C. H. E. and N. and to Father and Mother. Mr. and Mrs. Spaulding will go with us over the mountains.  We send our Christian regard to Broth and Sister Hull, Brother and Sister Allen, Bro. and Sister Patrick and all who inquire. I have become very much interested in the Nez Perces lads. They are very affectionate and seem to wish to please us in every way. We think they will be of great service to the Mission in various ways. We have just had a call from Dr. and Mrs. Wisner. We expect the boat will leave soon --Farewell, dear dear Parents. From your unworthy children

(P.S.) Mother, I forgot to say that I heard Dr. Beecher . . . in C. while I was there. . Dr. B. appears the same in the pulpit that he does at a distance -- I mean he is a small man, quite indifferent in his appearance, I could hardly believe it was he when I saw him come. N.W.
