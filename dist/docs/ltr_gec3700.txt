Sir, 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency from <a href='/results.php?city=poughkeepsie' rel='city'>Poughkeepsie</a> on 
Saturday last, and communicated to you the accounts 
which I had then received from this quarter. The 
next day I set out for this place, and arrived here 
on Monday. Upon my arrival, I found the main 
body of the enemy, which appeared in the northward, 
had returned by the way of Lake George ; and that 
part of the country seemed again to be in a state of 
tranquillity. Yesterday morning, however, I was informed that a party had made its appearance at Ballston, and destroyed some buildings there ; and, about 
noon, received accounts that the enemy were at Schoharie, and it is now confirmed that they have destroyed the whole of that valuable settlement. Their 
numbers of one division are computed at about six 
hundred, and the accounts of the other division are 
uncertain. They have artillery with them. Major 
Woolsey, who commands two hundred of the levies, 
made a sally from one of the small forts there, and 
took two regulars and killed five savages. By what 
route they came, or mean to return, I have not been 
able to ascertain. Yesterday morning I ordered General Van Rensselaer, with some troops, to Schenectady, with directions, as soon as he could make the proper discoveries, and if his force should appear competent, to march and endeavour to intercept them. 
</p><p>
By a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a> at <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, I 
am informed that the enemy yesterday burnt the 
settlement of white Creek, in Charlotte county; and 
the smoke was discoverable from the heights, near 
his house. 
</p><p>
The post at <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a>, after the removal of The 
stores, is evacuated, the levies, who were stationed 
there, having insisted that their time of service is 
expired ; and Colonel Livingston, the commanding officer, with the other officers, are now on their return. 
I have ordered out the whole of the militia from this 
part of the State. A considerable part are already 
in the field, and I shall leave this immediately for 
Schenectady, in order to make the necessary arrangement. 
</p><p>
From this state of matters, your Excellency will 
perceive the necessity of sending a force, if it can 
possibly be spared, for the defence of this part of the 
country. No dependence can be placed on the militia remaining from home, and the three months' levies 
will soon be dismissed ; so that, without some farther 
protection, Schenectady and this place will be our 
frontier. I received no intelligence from the Grants, 
either whether the enemy have done any mischief 
there, or whether their militia is turning for our assistance. 
</p><p>
am, &c., 
</p><p>
