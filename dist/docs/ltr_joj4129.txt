Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for your obliging letter of the 8th of 
last month, and for the book which accompanied it. As 
yet, I have not had time to give it that regular and attentive 
perusal which it appears to merit. It certainly contains 
much interesting information, and from your accuracy, I 
presume that the facts and statements in it are correct. It 
will naturally lead both our own people and foreigners to 
form a favourable and just estimate of the United States, 
and show in a strong light the policy of maintaining that 
respect for our government and laws, without which our 
local and other advantages can neither be enjoyed nor 
improved. 
</p><p>
The manner in which the insurrection has been dissipated gives me pleasure ; and there is reason to hope that 
the arts and counsels which produced it, will not be able 
to operate such another. 
</p><p>
Our affairs relative to this country have a promising 
aspect. The best disposition towards us prevails here, and 
the indications and proofs of it daily increase. I do really 
believe, that this government means to give conciliatory 
measures with the United States a full and fair trial. I 
wish it may be reciprocated on our part. It never can be 
wise to cast ourselves into the arms and influence of any 
nation ; but certainly it is wise and proper to cherish the 
good-will of those who wish to be on terms of friendship 
and cordiality with us. It may seem strange, and yet I am 
convinced, that next to the king, our president is more popular in this country than any man in it. 
</p><p>
With the best wishes, and with sentiments of esteem and 
regard, I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
