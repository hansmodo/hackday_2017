My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have to ask pardon for omitting to inform you what was done with the letter for Mr. Bringhurst. The 
day after its arrival here, Mr. Chaloncr, one of our commissaries, set out for German Town, on some 
business, and took charge of it. As lie has not since returned to camp, I am not yet acquainted of the fate of it. 
</p><p>
We have lately been in a most alarming situation 
for want of provisions. The soldiers were scarcely 
restrained from mutiny by the eloquence and management of our officers. Those who are employed to 
feed us, either for want of knowledge or for want of 
activity or both, never furnish supplies adequate to our 
wants. 
</p><p>
I have more than once mentioned to you that we 
have been obliged to renounce the most important 
enterprises, delay the most critical marches, by the 
delinquency of commissaries. Here of late it has 
reduced us almost to the point of disbanding. The 
head of the department is a stationary attendant on 
Congress; what he might do if he had views sufficiently extensive, by a proper employment of agents, 
I know not; but as the case is at present, he seems 
to be almost useless. I have heard it asserted by more 
than one sensible, disinterested man, that the removal 
of <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Mr. Trumbull</a> from that office has been the source 
of all our misfortunes. lie had .considerable connections and influence in a great meat country, and had 
laid such a train for supplying the army, as in all 
probability would have put us out of the reach of bad 
weather, difficult roads and other common accidents. 
Certain it is that the want of providence , or want of 
ability in the present managers, has brought us to the 
brink of ruin. By extraordinary exertions, by scraping from distant scanty magazines and collecting with 
parties, we have obtained a temporary relief; and 
have hopes that the representation of our late distress 
to several persons of influence and authority in different states, will procure us such farther supplies as will 
save us from the disagreeable necessity of dividing the 
army into cantonments. 
</p><p>
To the ill offices of Trumbull's friends we may attribute perhaps a part of our distress. The increasing number of privateers in the New England states, 
the subsistence of the convention troops, and an expedition now on foot, will greatly diminish the meat 
resources of the country on which we principally 
depend. The carcasses of horses about the camp, and 
the deplorable leanness of those which still crawl in 
existence, speak the want of forage equal to that of 
human food. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a> with a party of two 
thousand, is now foraging, but will be able to collect 
only the gleanings of a country over which an unsparing enemy has passed. 
</p><p>
A small detachment from his party under the command of Major Billiard, made an attempt to surprise 
the enemy's picket near their bridge. The design was 
discovered and the picket had time to post itself in a 
stone house, at the distance of 500 yards. Our men 
were saluted with a general discharge ; they marched 
forward and returned the lire, and would have proceeded to storming the house, but it was thought more 
advisable to retire. Our party had five men slightly 
wounded; the enemy's loss was one Hessian killed, 
and another mortally wounded. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>Gen'l Wayne</a> is detached by <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Greene</a> to cross 
the Delaware at Wilmington, for the purpose of destroying all the hay on the Jersey shore which we 
cannot secure for our own use, and which may fall 
into the enemy's hands, and with a view of driving all 
the cattle from the neighborhood of the river, by a 
circuitous road to camp. If he finds it practicable to 
cross the river and carry that plan into execution, he 
is to make a large sweep and return here with what 
ever he can collect by the way of Gorshen. 
</p><p>
The disaffected inhabitants find means to conceal 
their teams and cattle, so that the country appears 
more naked than it really is. 
</p><p>
Deserters from the enemy inform us that they are 
preparing for a grand forage, and that they will probably make it in Bucks county. We have the same 
business in contemplation in the same place. 
</p><p>
I must not omit informing you of a gallant defence 
made by a justice of the peace in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> county 
(0n the other side of the Schuylkil), known by the 
appellation of Squire Knox. This gentleman's house 
was surrounded early in the morning some days ago 
by a party of traitors, lately distinguished by the title 
of royal refugees; he was in bed in a lower room, and 
upon their demanding admittance, was going to open 
to them, when his son who was above, and perceiving 
from the window fixed bayonets, call'd to him to keep 
his door shut and warned him of danger. The villains in the mean time pressed against the door ; 
the old man armed himself with his cutlass, and his 
son descended with a gun. The door was at length 
forced half open by one of the most enterprising; 
the father kept it in that position with his left hand, 
and employed his right in defending the passage. 
After some vigorous strokes, his cutlass broke ; the 
bad condition of the son's fusil had prevented his 
tiring till this moment. He was now prepared to salute 
the assailants, but the old man thinking all was lost by 
the failure of his weapon, called to him not to fire ; 
upon farther examination, however, he says he found 
that by being shortened, it was only better adapted 
to close quarters, and renewed the fight. 
</p><p>
The villains fired seven shots through the door, one 
of which grazed the squire's knee, which was all the 
damage done. They then threw down their arms and 
took to their heels ; they were pursued by the Knoxes 
and a family of militia, and one of them who was 
concealed in a cellar was taken. 
</p><p>
The besetting Mr. Knox's house is a matter of civil cognizance, but it appears that the prisoner has held 
correspondence with the enemy, and supplied them with provisions, and he will probably suiter death for those offences by sentence of court-martial. 
</p><p>
It is said that a number of deserters from the convention troops have found means to introduce themselves as substitutes among the militia. 
</p><p>
Don t you think my dear father that this matter 
should he provided against? I have insensibly written 
a letter, which perhaps you will not have time to read. 
It is not uncommon, however, to look at the exordium 
and peroration ; you may think it policy therefore in me 
to repeat my request for cloths in this place, but I 
assure you it was accidental. You will by complying 
with it contribute to the propriety of the Commander 
in chief's family, and infinitely oblige, 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate 
</p><p>
