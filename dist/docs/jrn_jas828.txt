Capt Hart of the Mormon Battaillon arrived, with a good many of his Men on their Way to great Salt Lake. They had Orders for Govt. Horses, which I delivered to them, (War Horses) not paid for yet. They bought provisions and got Blacksmith work done. I employed about Eighty Men of them, some as Mechanics, some as laborers, on the Mill and Millraise at Brighton; some as laborers at the Sawmill at Columa.
