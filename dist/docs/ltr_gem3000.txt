DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I wrote you in July, a little before my being ordered to the Convention, congratulating you upon 
an appointment which gives so much satisfaction to 
all America, and afterwards, in August, from <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> ; since which I have to acknowledge your 
favor of the 20th of August, which nothing but want 
of health should have prevented my answering sooner, 
as I shall always think myself honored by your correspondence and friendship. I hinted to you, in my 
last, the parties and factions which prevailed at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>. I never was in so disagreeable a situation, and 
almost despaired of a cause which I saw so ill conducted. Mere vexation and disgust threw me into such 
an ill state of health, that, before the Convention rose, 
I was sometimes near fainting in the House. Since 
my return home, I have had a severe fit of sickness, 
from which I am now recovering, but am still very 
weak and low. 
</p><p>
During the first part of the Convention, parties 
ran so high, that we had frequently no other way of 
preventing improper measures, but by procrastination, 
urging the previous question, and giving men time 
to reflect. However, after some weeks, the babblers 
were pretty well silenced, a few weighty members 
began to take the lead, several wholesome regulations 
were made, and, if the Convention had continued to 
sit a few days longer, I think the public safety 
would have been as well provided for as our present 
circumstances permit. The Convention, not thinking 
this a time to rely upon resolves and recommendations only, and to give obligatory force to their proceedings, adopted the style and form of legislation, 
changing the word enact into ordain; their ordinances 
were all introduced in the form of bills, were regularly referred to a Committee of the whole House, and underwent three readings before they were passed. 
</p><p>
I inclose you the ordinance for raising an armed 
force, for the defence and protection of this Colony ; 
it is a little defaced, by being handled at our District Committee, but it is the only copy I had at 
present by me. You will find some little inaccuracies in it ; but, upon the whole, I hope it will 
merit your approbation. The minute plan I think is 
a wise one, and will, in a short time, furnish eight 
thousand good troops, ready for action, and composed 
of men in whose hands the sword may be safely 
trusted. To defray the expense of the provisions 
made by this ordinance, and to pay the charge of 
the last year's Indian War, we are now emitting the 
sum of three hundred and fifty thousand pounds, in 
paper currency. I have great apprehensions, that 
the large sums in bills of credit, now issuing all over 
the Continent, may have fatal effects in depreciating 
the value ; and therefore opposed any suspension of 
taxation, and urged the necessity of immediately laying  such taxes as the people could bear, to sink the 
sum emitted as soon as possible; but was able only 
to reduce the proposed suspension from three years to 
one. The land and poll tax (the collection of which 
is to commence in June, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>,) will sink fifty thou 
sand pounds per year ; and instead of the usual 
commissions for emitting and receiving, the Treasurer 
is allowed an annual salary of six hundred and 
twenty-five pounds. 
Our friend, the Treasurer, was the warmest man in 
the Convention, for immediately raising a standing 
army of not less than four thousand men, upon constant pay. They stood a considerable time at three 
thousand, exclusive of the troops upon the western 
frontiers ; but, at the last reading, (as you will see 
by the ordinance), were reduced one thousand and 
twenty, rank and file ; in my opinion, a well-judged 
reduction, not only from our inability to furnish, at 
present, such a number with arms and ammunition, 
but I think it extremely imprudent to exhaust our-ourselves before we know when we are to be at-tacked. The part we have to act, at present, seems 
to require our laying in good magazines, training 
our people, and having a good number of them ready 
for action. An ordinance is passed for regulating 
an annual election of members to the Convention 
and County Committees ; for encouraging the making 
saltpetre, sulphur, and gunpowder ; for establishing a 
manufactory of arms, under the direction of commissioners ; and for appointing a Committee of Safety, 
consisting of eleven members, for carrying the ordinances of the Convention into execution, directing 
the stations of the troops, and calling the minute-battalions and drafts from the militia into service, if 
necessary, &c. 
</p><p>
There is also an ordinance establishing articles for 
the government of the troops, principally taken from 
those drawn up by the Congress, except that about 
martial law upon life and death is more cautiously 
constituted, and brought nearer to the principles of 
the common law. 
</p><p>
Many of the principal families are removing from Norfolk, Hampton, York, and <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, occasioned by the behaviour of Lord Dunmore, and the 
commanders of the King's ships and tenders upon this station. 
</p><p>
Whenever your leisure will permit, it will always 
give me the greatest pleasure to be informed of your 
welfare, and to hear what is doing on the great 
American theatre. 
</p><p>
I most sincerely wish you health and success equal 
to the justice of our cause ; and am, with great 
respect, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gem" rel="me">GEORGE MASON</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I beg the favor of you to remember me kindly to General Lee, and present him my respectful compliments.
