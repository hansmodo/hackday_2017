DEAR SIR, Your two favours of the 1 and 20 September, 
under the same cover, by Mr. Fitzhugh, did not come to hand 
till the 24th ultimo, and of course till it was too late for any 
Legislative interposition with regard to the Capitol. I have 
written to the Attorney on the subject. A letter which I have 
from him, dated prior to his receipt of mine, takes notice of the 
plan you had promised, and makes no doubt that it will arrive 
in time for the purpose of the Commissioners. I do not gather 
from his expressions, however, that he was aware of the change 
which will become necessary in the foundation already laid, a 
change which will not be submitted to without reluctance, for 
two reasons: 1. The appearance of caprice to which it may 
expose the Commissioners. 2. Which is the material one, the 
danger of retarding the work till the next session of Assembly 
can interpose a vote for its suspension, and possibly for a removal to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">WILLIAMSBURG</a>. This danger is not altogether imaginary. Not a session has passed since I became a member without one or other or both of these attempts. 
</p><p>
At the late session a suspension was moved by the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">WILLIAMSBURG</a> interest, which was within a few votes of being agreed to. 
It is a great object, therefore, with the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> interest, to 
get the buildings so far advanced before the fall as to put an 
end to such experiments. The circumstances which will weigh 
in the other scale, and which, it is to be hoped, will preponderate, are the fear of being reproached with sacrificing public 
considerations to a local policy, and a hope that the substitution of a more economical plan may better reconcile the Assembly to a prosecution of the undertaking. 
</p><p>
Since I have been at home I have had leisure to review the 
literary cargo, for which I am so much indebted to your friendship. The collection is perfectly to my mind. I must trouble 
you only to get two little mistakes rectified. The number of 
vols. in the Encyclopedia corresponds with your list, but a duplicate has been packed up of Tom. 1, premiere partie of Histoire Naturelle, Quadrup&des, premiere livraison, and there is 
left out the second part of the same Tome, which, as appears 
by the Avis to the 1st Livraison, makes the 1st Tome of Histoire des oiseaux as well as by the Histoire des oixeaux sent, 
which begins with Tom. II repartie, and with the letter F from 
the Avis to the sixth Livraison. I infer that the vol. omitted 
made part of the 5th livraison. The duplicate vol. seems to 
have been a good deal handled, and possibly belongs to your 
own sett. Shall I keep it in my hands, or send it back? The 
other mistake is an omission of the 4th vol. of D'Albon sur 
1'interet de plusieurs nations, &c. The binding of the three 
vol 8 which are come is distinguished from that of most of the 
other books by the circumstance of the figure on the back numbering the vol 8 being on a black instead of a red ground. The 
author's name above is on a red ground. I mention these circumstances that the binder may supply the omitted volume in 
proper uniform. 
</p><p>
I annex a state of our account balanced. I had an opportunity a few days after yourwere received of remitting 
the balance to the hands of Mrs. Carr, with a request that it 
might be made use of as you directed, to prevent a loss of time 
to her sons from occasional disappointments in the stated funds. 
I have not yet heard from the Mr. Fitzhughs on the subject of 
your advance to them. The advance to Le Maire had been 
made a considerable time before I received your countermanding instructions. I have no copying press, bufr must postpone 
that conveniency to other wants which will absorb my little 
resources. I am fully apprized of the value of this machine, 
and mean to get one when I can better afford it and may have 
more use for it. I am led to think it would be a very economical acquisition to all our public offices, which are obliged to 
furnish copies of papers belonging to them.

A quorum of the deputies appointed by the Assembly for a 
commercial Convention had a meeting at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a> shortly 
after I left it, and the Attorney tells me it has been agreed to 
propose <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=annapolis" rel="city">ANNAPOLIS</a> for the place, and the first monday in September for the time, of holding the Convention. It was thought 
prudent to avoid the neighborhood of Congress and the large 
Commercial towns, in order to disarm the adversaries to the 
object of insinuations of influence from either of these quarters. 
I have not heard what opinion is entertained of this project at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, nor what reception it has found in any of the States. 
If it should come to nothing, it will, I fear, confirm Great Britain and all the world in the belief that we are not to be respected nor apprehended as a nation in matters of commerce. 
The States are every day giving proofs that separate regulations 
are more likely to set them by the ears than to attain the common object. When Massachusetts set oh foot a retaliation of 
the policy of Great Britain, Connecticut declared her ports free. 
New Jersey serv. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> in the same way. And Delaware, 
I am told, has lately followed the example, in opposition to the 
commercial plans of Pennsylvania. 
</p><p>
A miscarriage of this attempt to unite the States in some 
effectual plan will have another effect of a serv.us nature. It 
will dissipate every prospect of drawing a steady revenue from 
our imposts, either directly into the federal treasury, or indirectly through the treasuries of the Commercial States, and, of 
consequence, the former must depend for supplies solely on annual requisitions, and the latter on direct taxes drawn from the 
property of the Country. That these dependencies are in an 
alarming degree fallacious, is put by experience out of all question. The payments from the States under the calls of Congress 
have in no year borne any proportion to the public wants. 
During the last year, that is, from November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1784">1784</a>, to November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1785">1785</a>, the aggregate payments, as stated to the late Assembly, fell short of 400,000 dollars, a sum neither equal to the 
interest due on the foreign debts, nor even to the current expences of the federal Government. The greatest part of this 
sum, too, went from Virginia, which will not supply a single 
shilling the present year. 
</p><p>
Another unhappy effect of a continuance of the present anarchy of our commerce will be a continuance of the unfavorable 
balance on it, which, by draining us of our metals, furnishes 
pretexts for the pernicious substitution of paper money, for indiligences to debtors, for postponements of taxes. In fact, most 
of our political evils may be traced up to our commercial ones, 
as most of our moral may to our political. The lessons which 
the mercantile interest of Europe have received from late experience will probably check their propensity to credit us beyond 
our resources, and so far the evil of an unfavorable balance 
will correct itself. But the Merchants of Great Britain, if no 
others, will continue to credit us, at least as far as our remittances can be strained, and that is far enough to perpetuate our 
difficulties, unless the luxurious propensity of our own people 
can be otherwise checked. 
</p><p>
This view of our situation presents the proposed Convention 
as a remedial experiment which ought to command every assent; but if it be a just view, it is one which assuredly will not 
be taken by all even of those whose intentions are good. I 
consider the event, therefore, as extremely uncertain, or rather, 
considering that the States must first agree to the proposition 
for sending deputies, that these must agree in a plan to be sent 
back to the States, and that these again must agree unanimously 
in a ratification of it, I almost despair of success. It is necessary, however, that something should be tried, and if this be 
not the best possible expedient, it is the best that could possibly 
be carried through the Legislature here. And if the present 
crisis cannot effect unanimity, from what future concurrence of 
circumstances is it to be expected ? Two considerations particularly remonstrate against delay. One is the danger of having 
the same game played on our Confederacy by which Philip 
managed that of the Grecians. I saw enough during the late 
Assembly of the influence of the desperate circumstances of individuals on their public conduct, to admonish me of the possibility of finding in the council of some one of the States fit instruments of foreign machinations. The other consideration is 
the probability of an early increase of the confederated States, 
which more than proportionally impede measures which require 
unanimity; as the new members may bring sentiments and interests less congenial with those of the Atlantic States than 
those of the latter are one with another. 
The price of our staple is down at 22s. at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a>. One 
argument for putting off the taxes was, that it would relieve the 
planters from the necessity of selling, and would enable them 
to make a better bargain with the purchaserv. The price has, 
notwithstanding, been falling ever since. How far' the event 
may have proceeded from a change in the Market of Europe, I 
know not. That it has in part proceeded from the practice of 
remitting and postponing the taxes, may, I think, be fairly deduced. The scarcity of money must, of necessity, sink the price 
of every article, and the relaxation in collecting the taxes increases this scarcity by diverting the money from the public 
Treasury to the shops of Merchandize. In the former case it 
would return into circulation. In the latter, it goes out of the 
Country to balance the increased consumption. A vigorous 
and steady collection of taxes would make the money necessary 
here, and would therefore be a mean of keeping it here. In our 
situation it would have the salutary operation of a sumptuary 
law. The price of Indian Corn in this part of the Country, 
which produced the best crops, is not higher than two dollars 
per barrel. It would have been much higher but for the peculiar mildness of the winter. December and January scarcely 
reminded us that it was winter. February, though temperate, 
was less unseasonable. Our deepest snow (about seven inches) 
was in the present month. I observ.the tops of the blue ridge 
still marked with its remains. My last was dated January 
22d, and contained a narrative of the proceedings of the Assembly.
