Dear Brother : <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a>, April 25, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1861">1861</a>.

Virginia's secession influences some six millions of 
people. No use in arguing about it at all, but all the 
Virginians, or all who trace their lineage back, will feel 
like obeying her dictates and example. As a State, she 
has been proud, boastful, and we may say overbearing: 
but, on the other hand, she, by her governors and authority, has done everything to draw her native-born back to 
their State.

I cannot yet but think that it was a fatal mistake in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="colleague met">Mr. Lincoln</a> not to tie to his administration by some kind 
of link the Border States. Now it is too late, and sooner 
or later Kentucky, Tennessee, and Arkansas will be in 
arms against us. It is barely possible that Missouri may 
yet be neutral.

It is pretty nearly determined to divert the half million set aside for the July interest for arming the State. 
All the bankers but one have consented, and the Governor 
and legislature are strongly secession. I understand today the orders at the custom-house are to refuse clearance to steamboats to seceding States. All the heavy 
trade with groceries and provisions is with the South, 
and this order at once takes all life from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a>. 
Merchants, heretofore for peace and even for backing 
the administration, will now fall off, relax in their exertions, and the result will possibly be secession, and then 
free States against slave, the horrible array so long 
dreaded. I know Frank Blair desired this plain, square 
issue. It may be that sooner or later it is inevitable, but 
I cannot bring myself to think so. On the necessity of 
maintaining a government, and that government the old 
constitutional one, I have never wavered, but I do recoil 
from a war, when the negro is the only question.

I am informed that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gbm" rel="colleague met">McClellan</a> is appointed to command 
the Ohio militia, a most excellent appointment; a better officer could not be found.
