MY DEAR MR. CRAMER:
</p><p>
I am just in receipt of your letter of the 21st inst. enclosing one
from the Portuguese Minister to Denmark recounting the cause of his
brother-in-law's removal from the diplomatic service. I know Baron de
S----, and the Baroness very well and esteem them very highly. There
was never any difficulty with him and the State Department, or with any
official at Washington that I have any recollection of. I am very sure
that no cause of complaint could have existed on our part without my
knowing it. It would afford me the greatest pleasure to meet the Baron
and his wife during my European tour, but I fear I shall not be able to
do so. My trip through Spain and Portugal has been put off, or at least
postponed, for this year. On Saturday we leave here for the South of
France, from there to take a naval vessel to visit all points of
interest on the Mediterranean. We shall probably go up the Nile, and
spend the winter in a warm climate, to be ready for our northern tour
in the spring. It is barely possible that when we return from up the
Nile we may go on East, through China and Japan to San Francisco. But
this is not probable for another year. This will probably be the last
opportunity I shall ever have of visiting Europe, and there is much to
see that I have not seen, and cannot see this winter.
</p><p>
I hear from home occasionally, but not as often, probably, as you do.
All were well by the last advices received two days ago from Orville.
</p><p>
Please assure your colleague that I have no recollection of other than
the most pleasant relations between U.S. officials and the Baron de S.
</p><p>
With kind regards of Mrs. Grant, Jesse and myself, I am,
</p><p>
Very truly,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.
