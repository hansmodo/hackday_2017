On Sunday the sun rose beautifully and at an early hour we started on our journey. Until then we had passed over nothing but low, level plains, but as we approached the mountains the land
became more hilly and undulating. We travelled within fourteen miles of Burns' Diggings and thirty-five miles of Mariposa. During the day we crossed three or four small streams, forded by us in the usual way, wading straight through them. We saw a large number of deer but they were wild and we could not get near them. We fired two balls at a large wolf that came prowling round us, and judging from the way he acted and put off, we suppose one of them took effect. Towards evening we stopped at a large canvas house composing an eating house and store, all under one roof. Here we bought 4 lbs. of pilot bread at 75 cents per lb., and 3 1/2 lbs. beef at 37 1/2 cents. Small mackerel were worth 50 cents apiece and everything else in the same ratio. I boiled a pot of mush made of a box of meal kindly presented by Mr. Cox, the gentleman with whom we are travelling up to the diggings. There never came a Sabbath that I would more willingly have rested. We are galded and blistered, and our joints feel as if they would sooner break than bend. I don't know that I was ever more fatigued. But we are determined to push forward.

We commenced our journey again early this morning and crossed the Merced River about 10 A.M. in a flat boat, for which four teams, ours among the number, paid $5 each. A team that had crossed just before us paid $10, but it was a regular trader. The reduction was made on account of our teams belonging to emigrants reaching the mines for the first time. The ferry is known as the New York Company's Ferry.

As soon as we crossed this river the worst part of our journey commenced, for then we entered the high hills bordering the Sierra Nevada, climbing high rugged precipices and crossing low swampy quagmires,
in which we saw the bones and saddles of several mules that had been lost there. In ascending some of these steeps and crossing these swamps they had to hitch two teams to each wagon. Suppera cup of tea, a piece of boiled beef, cold, and a hard crackeris just over. We are encamped upon the side of a hill and near a small ravine in which we get our water, which is muddy. As we are but four or five miles from the first diggings, we hope tomorrow will put an end to our weary pilgrimage for a short time.
