Sir, 
</p><p>
There are two resolutions passed, relative to the 
restoration of the British prisoners, and to making 
arrangements for the surrender of the posts in the 
possession of the British troops ; the first of which is 
to be transacted by you in conjunction with the Secretary of War, the latter by yourself alone. I will 
explain to you some doubts which have arisen in 
Congress, with regard to the true construction of the 
provisional treaty, which may be of use to you in 
transacting the business above mentioned. 
</p><p>
The sixth article declares that there shall be no future confiscation, &c., after the ratification of the treaty in America ; and the seventh article makes the 
surrender of prisoners, evacuation of posts, cessation of hostilities, &c., to depend on that event, to wit, the ratification of the treaty in America. Now the doubt 
is, whether the treaty means the provisional treaty already concluded, or the definitive treaty to he concluded. The last construction is most agreeable to the 
letter of the provisional articles ; the former, most 
agreeable to the usual practice of nations; for hostilities commonly cease on the ratification of the preliminary treaty. There is a great diversity of opinion in Congress. It will be, in my opinion, advisable, at the same time that we do not communicate 
our doubts to the British, to extract their sense of the matter from them. 
</p><p>
This may be done by asking them at what period 
they are willing to stipulate the surrender of posts, 
at the same time that they are asked in what manner it will be most convenient to them to receive 
the prisoners. 
</p><p>
If they postpone the evacuation 'of the different 
posts to the definitive treaty, we shall then be justified in doing the same with respect to prisoners. The 
question will then arise, whether, on principles of 
humanity, economy, and liberality, we ought not to 
restore the prisoners at all events, without delay. 
Much may be said on both sides. I doubt the expedience of a total restoration of prisoners, until they 
are willing to fix the epochs at which they will take 
leave of us. It will add considerably to their strength; 
and accidents, though improbable, may happen. I confess, however, I am not clear in my opinion. I have 
the honor to be. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

P. S. The provisional or preliminary treaty is ratified by us, for the greater caution.
