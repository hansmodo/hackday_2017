SIR: 
</p><p>
It is the Governor's orders that two-thirds of the militia of thik State 
be embodied, and Gen. Williamson's orders to rne, to embody the same 
number of this regiment. You will, therefore, order one-third part of 
your company, with yourself, to join me on Friday, the 16th inst., on 
horseback, at Cowan's Ferry, well armed; and those who neglected 
going with your lieutenant when ordered, you will bring with you, that 
they may be dealt with as the law directs. You will bring an exact 
list of your company, as I am ordered to make a return of the payment. 
I am, sir, your most humble servant, 
</p><p>
