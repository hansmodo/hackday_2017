My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your several letters of the 4th 12th  & 18 th with several enclosures & 
accompanied by a number of late newspapers & extracts cut from others, 
reach me on the 5th ins t all at the same moment, with innumerable papers 
& letters congratulating me on the result of the battle of Buena Vista, 
many of which I fear I shall never be able to reply to ; but will do all I 
can in that way 
</p><p>
Let me assure you I am truly thankful for your letters which are 
read with deep interest alth it will not be in my power to reply to them 
at length, or even so much so as I could wish, but you must take the will 
for the deed, for be assured the wellfare of you & yours forms among the 
most important considerations in which I am interested ; you also have 
my thanks, for the papers & slips cut from others, which in addition to 
your letters I have read with pleasure, as well as with deep interest 
</p><p>
I was truly delighted to hear you had made a visit to Baton Rouge, 
where you found all in the enjoyment of good health, especially dear Anns 
so much improved, & truly hope she may have with her family the pleasure of enjoying many years of health, happiness & prosperity. I was 
gratified to hear she Ann had come down with you before bringing the 
children & made the necessary arrangements for housekeeping in the first 
instance, & then returned for them ; & flatter myself they will all join you 
at the proper time in good health, & without accident ; nor do I wish 
them to be in the least hurry in leaving Baton Rouge, hoping it has 
proved a pleasant residence to them. I had hoped that proper schools 
would have been found at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> adapted to the age & the state of 
acquirements of the children, in which case, most of the children if they 
had been willing to have done so, would have remained with their grand 
mother, at any rate till autumn; at which time it may be well to look out 
for a more healthy position. I have noticed with much interest, Mr 
Hunts from which I am satisfied he Mr Crittenden & Col Tibbatts done 
all in their power to procure Johns appointment but am & have been 
satisfied it will be without avail at present; he must therefore turn his 
attention to some other pursuit; in the first place completing his education; by which time something may be determined on. I deeply regret 
to hear of Dicks continued indisposition, & fear his long residence in N. 
Orleans where there are so many temptations, was not at all favorable to 
his recovery; if I was sure the water of the hot springs of Arkensas was 
adapted or would be beneficial to him, I would wish him to go there with 
as little delay as practicable, but without understanding in some way or 
other how the water there would suit his disease, I would not like to 
advise him to take that course. I deeply regretted to hear that the Mississippi was so very high & that my plantation with I suppose hundreds 
of others had been flooded & of course our crops destroyed; my purchase 
of said plantation has proved truly an unfortunate one, but it is useless 
now to complain or despond, but to do the best we can, in whatever 
position we may be placed in. Had my levee succeeded in protecting 
the land from inundation, I would have been contented with the same, & 
would have been contented as soon as this war was at an end, or before, to 
have retired to it, & devoted my self to superintending the same. For 
let matters eventuate as they may, I must leave & return to the U. States 
in this fall ; even if I have to retire from the service 
</p><p>
As regards Gen Worths professions I pay no confidence in them, or 
in those of his friend Sanders, while one should be polite & courteous to 
all, at the same time he ought to commit himself with few; W. I consider 
entirely unprincipled; & his friend S. a perfect demagouge. As to the 
presidency I have no wish to reach that position ; & if I could do so 
there are a number of distinguished statesmen in our country I would 
advance to that position, in preference to myself. At the same time I 
will not say I would not serve if the good people of the country should 
think proper to elect me; but I can truly say I have no wish to fill said 
office, & if I do so at all, it must be by the spontaneous will of a majority 
of the people, & not by any party; for could I be the chief magistrate 
of the republic by announcing myself as a candidate for the office, I 
would never reach it. At any rate I consider the time inauspicious for 
my coming or rather being brought out; & truly regret that any paper 
friendly to my election, has thought proper to bring my name before the 
country as connected with that position, or as a candidate for the same at 
this early day. I imagine Col Lyon was only feeling your pulse, to ascer 
tain my views through you; I do not consider him a very safe person; 
& no doubt you will meet with many such who you will fully understand. 
I am pleased to hear Gen Brooke takes my notice of him in the way he 
does in the correspondence between the Secretary of War & myself; for 
I have none but the kindest feelings toward the Gen & consider him a 
high minded honorable & gallant soldier, with a heart always in the right 
place 
</p><p>
[As you are] fully located at the Barracks near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a>, I hope 
unless you wish a change you will not be removed by Dr Barton or any 
one else. We are all quiet here nor do I expect to move forward into the 
heart of the enemies country for some time ; at any rate until prepared to 
meet with success. A portion of the n. Regt 8 have commenced arriving at 
Brazos, where they are to be organized by Gen Cadwalader, 1 & of course it 
will take some time to prepare them for the movement nor can I well 
move forward until this is done 
</p><p>
I observe your friend Judge Hunt, alludes to my being from a slave 
state as being a principal bar to my reaching the presidency; I would not 
do so if I could by advocating either the propriety of slavery, or abolition ; 
let this vexed question remain where the constitution placed it 
</p><p>
My health was never better than at present ; I was somewhat indisposed for some weeks after the battle of Buena Vista, & was confined to 
my camp with a sore leg for some two weeks from the bite of some 
poisonous insect, or a slight wound in the first instance from a thorn, but 
which is now perfectly well. Please remember me most affectionately to 
dear Ann & the children, or all of them that may be with you, as well as 
kindest regards to Majr & Mr Jouett & the two you ladies Miss Virginia 
& Josephine should they still be at the Barracks ; as well as to say to them 
I wish them to visit Baton Rouge & spend some time with their aunt 
before they return to Kentucky, or when on their way up the river. 
</p><p>
Wishing you & yours continued health, happiness & prosperity I remain 
</p><p>
Truly Your 
Friend

P. S. Since finishing my letter we have this moment rec d the Mexican official account of the battle of Cerro Gordo, fought on the 17th  ult 
between Santa Anna & <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a>, about 50 miles from Vera Cruz near 
Julappa, in which the former was entirely routed, with the loss of his 
artillery baggage &c. All of which you will have heard before this gets 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a>.
