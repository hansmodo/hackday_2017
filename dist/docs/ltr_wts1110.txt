Dear Brother: I received your letter explaining how 
you happened to sign for that Helper Book. Of course, 
it was an unfortunate accident, which will be a good reason for your refusing hereafter your signature to unfinished books. After Clark's resolution, you were right, of 
course, to remain silent. I hope you will still succeed, 
as then you will have ample opportunity to show a fair 
independence. 
</p><p>
The rampant Southern feeling is not so strong in 
Louisiana as in Mississippi and Carolina. Still, holding 
many slaves, they naturally feel the intense anxiety all 
must whose property and existence depend on the safety 
of their property and labor. I do hope that Congress 
may organize and that all things may move along sm 
It would be the height of folly to drive the South to desperation, and I hope, after the fact is admitted that the 
North has the majority and right to control national matters and interests, that they will so use their power as to 
reassure the South that there is no intention to disturb 
the actual existence of slavery. 
</p><p>
Yours,
