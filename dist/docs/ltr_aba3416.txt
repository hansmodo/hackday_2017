MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
Your kind letters of July and August are before 
me. I thank you most sincerely for the particular 
manner in which you write. I go along with you, 
and take an interest in every transaction which concerns those I love ; and I enjoy more pleasure from 
those imaginary scenes than I do from the drawingroom at St. James's. In one, I feel myself your 
friend and equal. In the other, I know I am looked 
down upon with a sovereign pride, and the smile of 
royalty is bestowed as a mighty boon. As such, 
however, I cannot receive it. I know it is due to 
my country, and I consider myself as complimenting 
the power before which I appear as much as I am 
complimented by being noticed by it. With these 
ideas, you may be sure my countenance will never 
wear that suppliant appearance, which begs for notice. 
Consequently, I never expect to be a Court favorite. 
Nor would I ever again set my foot there, if the 
etiquette of my country did not require it. But, 
whilst I am in a public character, I must submit to the 
penalty ; for such I shall ever esteem it. 
</p><p>
You will naturally suppose that I have lately been 
much fatigued. This is very true. I attended the 
drawing-room last week, upon the anniversary of 
the coronation of their Majesties. The company 
were very brilliant, and her Majesty was stiff with 
diamonds ; the three eldest Princesses and the Prince 
of Wales were present. His Highness looked much 
better than when I saw him before. He is a stout, 
well-made man, and would look very well if he had 
not sacrificed so much to Bacchus. The Princess 
Elizabeth I never saw before. She is about fifteen ; 
a short, clumsy miss, and would not be thought handsome if she was not a princess. The whole family 
have one complexion, and all are inclined to be 
corpulent. I should know them in any part of the 
world. Notwithstanding the English boast so much 
of their beauties, I do not think they have really so 
much of it as you will find amongst the same proportion of people in America. It is true that their 
complexions are undoubtedly fairer than the French, 
and in general their figure is good. Of this they 
make the best ; but 1 have not seen a lady in England who can bear a comparison with Mrs. Bingham, 
Mrs. Piatt, and a Miss Hamilton, who is a <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> 
vou no- ladv. Amongst the most celebrated of their 
beauties stands the Duchess of Devonshire, who is 
masculine in her appearance. Lady Salisbury is 
small and genteel, but her complexion is bad ; and 
Lady Talbot is not a Mrs. Bingham, who, taken 
altogether, is the finest woman I ever saw. The intelligence of her countenance, or rather, I ought to 
say, animation, the elegance of her form, and the 
affability of her manners, convert you into admiration ; 
and one has only to lament too much dissipation and 
frivolity of amusement, which have weaned her from 
her native country, and given her a passion and thirst 
after all the luxuries of Europe. 
</p><p>
The finest English woman I have seen is the 
eldest daughter of Mr. Dana, brother to our Mr. 
Dana ; he resides in the country, but was in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> 
with two of his daughters, when I first came here. 
I saw her first at Ranelagh. I was struck with her 
appearance, and endeavoured to find who she was ; 
for she appeared like Calypso amongst her nymphs, 
delicate and modest. She was easily known from 
the crowd, as a stranger. I had not long admired 
her, before she was brought by her father and introduced to me, after which she made me a visit, with 
her sister, who was much out of health. At the 
same time that she has the best title of anv English 
woman I have seen to the rank of a divinity, I would 
not have it forgotten that her father is an American, 
and, as he was remarkably handsome, no doubt she 
owes a large share of her beauty to him. 
</p><p>
I dread to hear from my dear aunt, lest melancholy tidings should reach me with respect to her. 
She is at the same critical period of life which 
proved fatal to Mrs. B. I will, however, hope that 
she may yet be spared to her friends. Though her 
health would never permit her to engage in the 
active business of her family, she was attentive to 
the interest and welfare of every individual of it. 
Like Sarah, she was always to be found in her tent. 
A more benevolent heart never inhabited a human 
breast. It was well-matched and seconded in a 
partner equally benevolent and humane, who has 
shared with us our former griefs, and will find us 
equally sympathetic towards himself, should so great 
a misfortune attend him as 1 fear. Indeed, I know 
not how to take my pen to write to him. I do not 
wonder that your heart was affected, or your spirits 
low, under the apprehension of losing one so deservedly dear to us all. Should this ornament be 
broken from the original building, it will be another 
memento to us of the frailty of the whole, and that 
duration depends not upon age. Yet who would 
desire to stand, the last naked pillar of the whole? 
I believe our social affections strengthen by age ; 
as those objects and amusements which gratified our 
youthful years lose their relish, the social converse 
and society of friends becomes more necessary. 
</p><p>
" Needful auxiliars are our friends, to give 
To social man true relish of himself." 
</p><p>
But I must close, as I am going to dine to-day 
with my friend Mrs. Rogers, where I have given 
myself an invitation, the occasion of which I will 
reserve for the subject of another letter, and subscribe myself affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
