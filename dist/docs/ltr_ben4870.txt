SIR, 
</p><p>
Lord Dartmouth, our American minister, came to town 
last week, and held his first levee on Wednesday, when I paid 
my respects to him, acquainting him at the same time, that 
I should in a few days wait upon him, on business from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ; which I have accordingly since done, and have put your 
petition to the King into his Lordship's hands, that being the 
regular course. 
</p><p>
He received me very obligingly, made no objection to my 
acting as agent without an appointment assented to by the 
governor, as his predecessor had done, so that I hope business 
is getting into a better train. I shall use my best endeavours 
in supporting the petition, and write you more fully by the 
next ship to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. In the mean time I remain with great 
respect, your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
