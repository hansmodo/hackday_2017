Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letters of the 19th and 21st of 
April, I have had the honor to receive. Nothing 
would afford me greater pleasure than to have it in 
my power to oblige Major Macpherson, especially as 
it will afford me an opportunity of obliging your Excellency at the same time. 
</p><p>
Inclosed is a copy of my last letter to Congress. 
Copies of my former letters I desired the President 
of Congress to forward to you, which I hope you 
have received. We are anxiously waiting the arrival 
of the second division of the French fleet. Virginia 
affords the most inviting object. Lord Cornwallis's army, and the garrison and shipping at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. 
The whole may be taken in three weeks, or less; 
while <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> will produce a long, 
tedious, and uncertain siege. I hope the Marquis 
will be successful in Virginia. What I mean by success is, to avoid a capital misfortune. Your Excellency will see, by my letters to Congress, I have left 
the command of all the force coming southward with 
the Marquis. My fears are principally from the enemy's superior cavalry. To the northward, cavalry is 
nothing, from the numerous fences; but to the southward a disorder, by a superior cavalry, may be improved into a defeat, and a defeat into a rout. Virginia and North Carolina could not be brought to 
consider the cavalry of such great importance as they 
are to the security of an army and the safety of a 
country. 
</p><p>
Before this, I hope the New England States have 
filled up their regiments. Nothing but drafting can 
lay a permanent foundation for the liberties of America; and with it we have little to fear, even from a 
failure of our finance. I am, with great respect. 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
