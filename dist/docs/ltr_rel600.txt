My Dear Sir:  Your letter of the 5th inst., inclosing a slip from
the Baltimore American, has been received.  The same statement has
been published at the North for several years.  The statement is not
true; but I have not thought proper to publish a contradiction, being
unwilling to be drawn into a newspaper discussion, believing that
those who know me would not credit it and those who do not would care
nothing about it.  I cannot now depart from the rule I have followed.
It is so easy to make accusations against the people at the South
upon similar testimony, that those so disposed, should one be refuted,
will immediately create another; and thus you would be led into endless
controversy.  I think it better to leave their correction to the return
of reason and good feeling.
</p><p>
Thanking you for your interest in my behalf, and begging you to
consider my letter as intended only for yourself, I am,
</p><p>
    Most respectfully your obedient servant,
</p><p>
