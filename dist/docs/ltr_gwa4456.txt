My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your private letter of the 18th ultimo came safe to hand. Although the honors of the field did not fall to your lot, I am convinced you deserved them. The 
chances of war are various, and the best concerted measures, and the most flattering prospects, may and often do deceive us ; especially while we are in the 
power of militia. The motives which induced you to seek an action with Lord Cornwallis, are supported upon the best military principles ; and the consequences, if you can prevent the dissipation of your 
troops, will no doubt be fortunate. Every support, that it is in my power to give you from this army, shall cheerfully be afforded ; but if I part with any more 
troops, I must accompany them, or have none to command, as there is not at this moment more than a garrison for <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, nor can I tell when there w ill be. 
</p><p>
I am much pleased to find by your letter, that the State of Virginia exerts itself to your satisfaction. My 
public and private letters strongly inculcate the necessity of this ; and I have again urged Congress to use every means in their power to facilitate the march 
of the Pennsylvania line ; as also to recruit, equip, and forward Moylan's dragoons to you with despatch. 
</p><p>
I should be very sorry on any occasion to hurt the feelings of <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker met'>Baron Steuben</a>, whom I esteem as a very 
valuable officer. But in the instance you have mentioned, there is no cause of complaint ; for, if he will 
advert to his own letters to me, he will find that there 
was a great probability of his having marched with a 
detachment to reinforce you. Besides which there 
was a necessity for sending a general officer with the detachment from hence, and political considerations, as 
it was to be a combined operation depending upon 
critical circumstances with a French land and sea 
force, pointed to the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='co-worker met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>. These 
are the facts, the knowledge of which must, I am persuaded, satisfy the Baron. 
</p><p>
I am truly sensible of the merit and fortitude of the 
veteran bands under your command, and wish the 
sentiments I entertain of their worth could be communicated with the warmth I feel them. It was my 
full intention to request you to thank Morgan and the 
gallant troops under his command for their brilliant 
victory ; but the hurry, in which my letters are too 
often written, occasioned the omission at the time I 
acknowledged the official account of that action. 
</p><p>
Your conjecture respecting the cause of the mutiny in the Pennsylvania line has more substantial ground 
for its support, than the letter of the member of Congress ; and I am mistaken if the licentious conduct of 
that line was not more the effect of an overcharge of spirits, on the 1st of January, than of premeditated design. 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to tell you, that, as far as I am acquainted with the opinion of Congress with respect to your conduct, it is much in your favor. That this is the sentiment of all the southern delegates I have 
great reason to believe, because I have it declared to me in explicit terms by some of them. I have received a letter from Mr. Custis, dated the 29th ultimo, in which are these words. " <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a> has 
by his conduct gained universal esteem, and possesses in the fullest degree the confidence of all ranks of people." He had then just returned from the Assembly at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>. I hope the disorder, of which 
you complained, was no other than the effect of over fatigue, and that you are now perfectly well. That successes equal to your merits and wishes may attend 
you, is the ardent desire of, dear Sir, &c.
