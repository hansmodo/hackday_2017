I forget the date of my last letter but believe that it is time to say something and keep you posted up in our affairs. We are a great and growing people here and I am proud to be able to state to you that Weaverville is going ahead, also the firm known as Buck & Cole. Their affairs are in a healthy condition. County scrip has gone up for one and the other had a store full of goods and good credit.

All traces of the fire have vanished and the old log
cabins have been replaced by elegant buildings. We have now been here one year and during this time the town has doubled in size. We now have fourteen stores, four hotels and four gambling saloons in full blast.

Last Sunday we had a cock-fight; today, three horse-races for three hundred dollars a side. I am sorry to have to record these last but you ought to know it all and to brighten the picture I will state that fighting has diminished and our efficient officers arrest the offenders at once and make them come down to the tune of twenty dollars and costs. Our jail is in a fair way, also, to open on the 20th.

Speaking of jails, Col. Harper, who left here a short time since, ostensibly to go after his wife, robbed a woman in the stage going down, of $1800, and is at present in jail at Hamilton awaiting his trial. This rather took us aback although we all believed him to be a scoundrel. His wife is said to be with him. There must be some kind of a compact between such persons that I can't understand. He knows she has 'the act of shame a thousand times committed' and as to his guilt there is proof positive, and yet they stick to each other and theirs is not the only instance of the kind that I know of.

Sarah has made and received a number of calls on the ladies here. She will probably give you an account of them better than I can. We are living en famille. The Metropolitan has closed. Two of the old Mess board with us. Sarah does very well in housekeeping, but what is the use of having a woman unless she can cook?

You spoke of the Chinese in your last letter. We have lots of them about and they are among our best customers and certainly the best foreigners we have. They buy lots of provisions, chiefly rice, flour, lard, codfish, tea, etc; drink whisky and smoke like other people. I rode down to the river yesterday. There are three hundred of them
on one bar that has been worked out by our people and they are perfectly satisfied if they make two or three dollars per day.
</p><p>
Besides these we have all nations and here, while I write, I can hear Dutch, French, Spanish, English and that rich Irish brogue (I hate the whole Irish race), all at once.

You who live under the Maine Liquor law can have no idea of the immense quantity of liquor consumed in one of these mining towns. There are fourteen bar rooms in this little town and I only wonder that there is not more drunkenness than there is. Although we all drink, the 'getting drunk' is done by very few and no man of any standing in the town ever thinks of doing such a thing.
