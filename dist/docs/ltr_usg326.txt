<i>biograper's note</i><p>[The great expedition into Kentucky:--Early in January, Grant had been
directed to make a reconnoissance in favor of Brigadier-General Buell
who was confronting the Confederate General Buckner at Bowling Green.
One force under General Smith went up the west bank of the Tennessee
to threaten Forts Heiman and Henry. McClernand went into west
Kentucky, one column threatening Columbus, and another the Tennessee
River. Grant went with the latter. The object of the expedition was
attained; troops were not sent to reinforce Buckner. Grant was now
eager to move against the forts on the Tennessee. This is his errand
to St. Louis, to ask permission of General Halleck to move against
them. He had long been convinced that the true line of operations was
up the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. Once these rivers were held by
the Union troops, the Confederates would be forced to evacuate
Kentucky altogether. But General Halleck opposed the plan.

DEAR SISTER:
</p><p>
You have seen through the papers notice of my return from the great
expedition into Kentucky. My orders were such and the force with me
also so small that no attack was allowable. I made good use of the
time however, making a splendid reconnoissance of the country over
which an army may have to move. I have now a larger force than <a href="/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="co-worker">General Scott</a> ever commanded prior to our present difficulties. I do hope it
will be my good fortune to retain so important a command for at least
one battle. I believe there is no portion of our whole army better
prepared to contest a battle than there is within my district, and I
am very much mistaken if I have not got the confidence of officers and
men. This is all important, especially so with new troops. I go
tonight to St. Louis to see <a href="/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="co-worker met">General Halleck</a>; will be back on Sunday
morning. I expect but little quiet from this on and if you receive but
short, unsatisfactory letters hereafter you need not be surprised.
</p><p>
Your letter asking me to intercede in behalf of Lieut. Jones was
received. I have no one of equal rank now to offer in exchange, unless
it should be some one of Jeff Thompson's command, but if it should
fall in my power to effect Lieutenant Jones' release, I shall be most
happy to do so. Write to me giving the first name, where he now is,
when taken and under what circumstances.
</p><p>
I think you may look for Julia and the children about the 1st of
February.
</p><p>
As I said before the three oldest will be left to go to school. Jess
is too small. You will like him the best of any of the children,
although he is the worst. I expect he will whip his Aunt Mary the
first day. Buck, though never really sick, is very delicate. He is the
best child I ever saw and is smart.
</p><p>
Give my love to all at home. I must close.
</p>
BROTHER ULYS.
