Dear Colonel 
</p><p>
I received yours of the 2Oth Ins't & am much obliged to you for your Caution, which I assure you, was needless, you are right to suppose I will 
Act the Soldier, necessity obliges, The Enemy have taken Fort Washington, (after an obstinate Defence), & made the Garrison, consisting of 
Near Two Thousand Men Prisoners, the, Loss on neither side is ascertained, the Enemies is supposed to be very Considerable, as, our Troops disputed 
their lines with them Two or three hours The Enemy have Crossed over, to the Jersey shore, & a great Fireing has been heard, Near Bergen, 
Rumor Says. Fort Lee is Also taken, this wants Confirmation, Col De Haas & Several Regiments are gone of this morning to Join <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="co-worker met">Gen Washington</a> on the Jersey side, Poor, is also 
ordered, there, as probably will be all the Troops who come from Tyonderoga 
</p><p>
Nothing can be determined, with Respect to a Fleet until, the determination of Congress is known, The Captains who, have engaged for the 
War, must be supplied with, Money to Reinlist, their Men, & pay of those whose times are, expired I could wish a Captain Retained for 
each Vessell, to Inlist as many Men as possible, one half of whom Officers & Men might go home on Furloughs for one Month as soon as the Ice [thickens ?] & the others in turn 
</p><p>
