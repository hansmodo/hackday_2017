</p><p>
Sir,
</p><p>
On receipt of your letter of August 6th, during my absence, the Council
had the irons taken off the prisoners of war. When your advice was
asked, we meant it should decide with us; and upon my return to
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, the matter was taken up and the enclosed advice given.
A parole was formed, of which the enclosed is
a copy, and tendered to the prisoners. They objected to that part of it
which restrained them from saying any thing to the prejudice of
the United States, and insisted on 'freedom of speech.' They were, in
consequence, remanded to their confinement in the jail, which must be
considered as a voluntary one, until they can determine with themselves
to be inoffensive in word as well as deed. A flag sails hence to-morrow
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">New York</a>, to negotiate the exchange of some prisoners. By her I have
written to General Phillips on this subject, and enclosed to him copies
of the within; intending it as an answer to a letter I received from him
on the subject of Governor Hamilton.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, Sir,
</p><p>
your most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="me">Th: Jefferson</a>.
</p>
