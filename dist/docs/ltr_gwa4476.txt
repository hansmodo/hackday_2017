Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
As you are perfectly acquainted with the plan, which 
has been concerted with his Excellency <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> at Weathersfield, I need not enter into a 
detail of particulars. I have only to request, therefore, 
that you will be pleased to make the estimates of the 
articles in your department necessary for the operation, and that the previous arrangements for the siege, 
as far as they are within the limits of our ability, may 
be put in the best train, which the circumstances will 
admit. In the mean time, as it has become necessary, 
from the decay of the works, the demolition of the 
barracks, and other circumstances, to abandon the post 
of Fort Schuyler, and erect new fortifications, at or 
near Fort Herkimer, I have to request, that you will 
send an engineer to superintend the works in that department. I am, dear Sir, &,c.
