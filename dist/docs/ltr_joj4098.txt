Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The inefficacy of our government becomes daily more 
and more apparent. Our treasury and our credit are in a 
sad situation : and it is probable that either the wisdom or 
the passions of the people will produce changes. A spirit 
of licentiousness has infected Massachusetts, which appears 
more formidable than some at first apprehended. Whether 
similar symptoms will not soon mark a like disease in several other States is very problematical. 
</p><p>
The public papers herewith sent contain every thing 
generally known about these matters. A reluctance to 
taxes, an impatience of government, a rage for property 
and little regard to the means of acquiring it, together with 
a desire of equality in all things, seem to actuate the mass 
of those who are uneasy in their circumstances. To these 
may be added the influence of ambitious adventurers, and 
the speculations of the many characters who prefer private 
to public good, and of others who expect to gain more from 
wrecks made by tempests than from the produce of patient and honest industry. As the knaves and fools of this 
world are for ever in alliance, it is easy to perceive how 
much vigour and wisdom a government, from its construction and administration, should possess, in order to repress 
the evils which naturally flow from such copious sources of 
injustice and evil. 
</p><p>
Much, I think, is to be feared from the sentiments which 
such a state of things is calculated to infuse into the minds 
of the rational and well-intentioned. In their eyes, the 
charms of liberty will daily fade ; and in seeking for peace 
and security, they will too naturally turn towards systems 
in direct opposition to those which oppress and disquiet 
them. 
</p><p>
If faction should long bear down law and government, tyranny may raise its head, or the more sober part of the 
people may even think of a king. 
</p><p>
In short, my dear sir, we are in a very unpleasant situation. Changes are necessary; but what they ought to be, 
what they will be, and how and when to be produced, are 
arduous questions. I feel for the cause of liberty, and for 
the honour of my countrymen who have so nobly asserted 
it. and who, at present, so abuse its blessings. If it should 
not take root in this soil, little pains will be taken to cultivate it in any other. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, with great respect, 
Dear sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
John J a v.
