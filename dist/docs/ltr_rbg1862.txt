I have so entirely recovered from my indisposition, that I was sorry My Beloved Brother you had been made anxious 
about it- Dear Ann & Miriam told me about your journey and its results. I was glad Ann and Jo Shelby's wife were  
saved the painful necessity for a longer journey- these are times when every days events are eagerly enquired for, and 
we are grateful when sad events or threatened dangers are not recorded. 
</p><p>
I have felt a great deal for you My Dear brother, who for so many months, have been anxiously watching, and 
striving to avert the dangers around- this dreadful rebellion seems hidra headed- I hoped when the traitor Morgan was 
defeated Kentucky would have rest and the law abiding community restored to order, and security- but it seems you 
are still surrounded by evil spirits, requiring the strong arm of authority- I am grieved that you were obliged to make 
sacrifices so near home, but if you get relieved from the pressure of care, it is by no means to be lamented. No 
property, no wealth can be enjoyed, while a deep seated obligation is left to prey on the mind- thank God you have 
domestic love & happiness around you, which I trust you may long revel in, and have health to enjoy- It will make us 
very happy My dear Ben to embrace you, and any of your beloved family who will accompany you- .... 
</p><p>
Our wanderers are returning from their summer tour- The Holidays (New Year) on Monday week will find them all at 
home- this day is the anniversary of our Parents death- which never passes, without bringing fond & sad memories 
to me. May God accept My deep felt penitence, for all the sins of commission & omission of duties, of which My conscience accuses me. towards these best of parents- we have 
had letters from Miriam as late as ist Aug. written in good spirits- Gratz was with her, she sends love messages to you & 
all her relations & friends - her children all at home - but not a word of fear or indeed of any thing but personal condition 
& feelings - Alfred writes constantly to apprise his Mother of his health - expresses himself like a soldier - sans fear or reproach- poor Sara! she glories in his position, not withstanding a Mother's fears for his safety- Charles Etting is at 
present on duty here, where he will probably be detained for some weeks- Theodore at sea .... 
</p><p>
God bless you, my own dear Brother, be cheerful & happy prays your devoted sister
