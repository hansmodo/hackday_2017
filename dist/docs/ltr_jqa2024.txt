DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Our electors met in this town on Wednesday last, and 
their votes for President and Vice President were unanimous. This was generally expected here, and the event is 
supposed to have been nearly if not wholly the same in all 
the New England states. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> it is imagined was 
unanimous for Mr. Clinton as V[ice] President]. Their 
electors are chosen by their legislature, where their Governor 
has a bare majority, determined to support upon all occasions 
his party and his politics. From the other states you will 
probably hear before us. And upon the whole I presume 
the election will be favorable.

The Governor has at length prevailed in routing the players. On Wednesday the Attorney General J received orders 
from him and the Council to prosecute the violators of the 
laws immediately. He applied for a warrant to a Justice 
of the Peace returnable before two Justices of the quorum. 
The sheriff arrested one of the actors behind the scenes in 
the course of the play on Wednesday evening, and informed 
the company that unless they dispersed immediately he 
should arrest all the other performers for the evening. The 
company immediately assumed the form of a deliberative 
assembly, and debated the question, whether they should 
retire or direct the players to proceed and bid defiance to the 
sheriff. They concluded that obedience to the law was the 
safest party and withdrew, not without many imprecations 
against the Governor and the law upon which they were 
interrupted. The next morning the examination upon the 
warrant was to take place, and the justices met at Faneuil Hall, their own offices being too small and the Court House 
occupied by the district court. The Hall was about half 
full of spectators who took every opportunity to express 
their disapprobation of the proceedings. An objection was 
taken by Mr. Otis, counsel for the defendant, to the warrant, 
as not being founded upon oath, but only upon an official 
complaint of the Attorney General. Whether Sullivan 
committed the blunder from ignorance or from inattention, 
or from design, is doubtful, but the by-standers enjoyed a 
hearty laugh at his expense. He has affected a kind of 
neutrality upon this occasion and has avoided giving offence to either party by being active on either side. It was sup 
posed by many persons that he proceeded thus irregularly on purpose to give the players an opportunity to escape, and 
he himself wishes to have it understood that he acts only in consequence of express directions from the Governor and Council. The objection however prevailed, and the player 
who had been arrested was discharged amid the loud and very improper plaudits of the audience. Justice Barrett with proper spirit reproved their conduct in the Hall, upon 
which they were quiet ; but as soon as they got out of the Hall they closed the business with three huzzas. The players in the meantime had taken the alarm and most of them 
are gone ; so that I hope we shall have no more altercations upon this subject.
