<a rel='month origin' value='8'>August</a> <a rel='day origin' value='19'>19th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. Began my regular attendance on the Wayside Hospital. To-day we gave wounded men, as they 
stopped for an hour at the station, their breakfast. Those who are able to come to the table do so. The badly wounded 
remain in wards prepared for them, where their wounds are dressed by nurses and surgeons, and we take bread and butter, beef, ham, and hot coffee to them.

One man had hair as long as a woman's, the result of a vow, he said. He had pledged himself not to cut his hair 
until peace was declared and our Southern country free. Four made this vow together. All were dead but himself. 
One was killed in Missouri, one in Virginia, and he left one at Kennesaw Mountain. This poor creature had had one 
arm taken off at the socket. When I remarked that he was utterly disabled and ought not to remain in the army, he 
answered quietly, " I am of the First Texas. If old <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> can go with one foot I can go with one arm, eh ? !

How they quarreled and wrangled among themselves Alabama and Mississippi, all were loud for <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston</a>, 
save and except the long-haired, one-armed hero, who cried at the top of his voice : l Oh ! you all want to be kept in 
trenches and to go on retreating, eh? " " Oh, if we had had a leader, such as Stonewall, this war would have been 
over long ago! What we want is a leader! " shouted a 
cripple.

They were awfully smashed-up, objects of misery, wounded, maimed, diseased. I was really upset, and came 
home ill. This kind of thing unnerves me quite.

Letters from the army. <a href='/results.php?tla=usg' rel=''>Grant's</a> dogged stay about Richmond is very disgusting and depressing to the spirits. 
Wade Hampton has been put in command of the Southern cavalry.

A Wayside incident. A pine box, covered with flowers, 
was carefully put upon the train by some gentlemen. Isabella asked whose remains were in the box. Dr. Gibbes re 
plied : "In that box lies the body of a young man whose family antedates the Bourbons of France. He was the last 
Count de Choiseul, and he has died for the South." Let his memory be held in perpetual remembrance by all who 
love the South!
