<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='28'>28th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. I did leave with regret Maum Mary. She was such a good, well-informed old thing. My Molly, 
though perfection otherwise, does not receive the confidential communications of new-made generals at the earliest 
moment. She is of very limited military information. Maum Mary was the comfort of my life. She saved me 
from all trouble as far as she could. Seventy, if she is a day, she is spry and active as a cat, of a curiosity that 
knows no bounds, black and clean; also, she knows a joke at first sight, and she is honest. I fancy the negroes are 
ashamed to rob people as careless as James Chesnut and myself.

One night, just before we left the Congaree House, Mr. Chesnut had forgotten to tell some all-important thing to 
Governor Gist, who was to leave on a public mission next day. So at the dawn of day he put on his dressing-gown and 
went to the Governor's room. He found the door unlocked 
and the Governor fast asleep. He shook him. Half-asleep, 
the Governor sprang up and threw his arms around Mr. Chesnut's neck and said : " Honey, is it you ? The mistake was rapidly set right, and the bewildered plenipotentiary was given his instructions. Mr. Chesnut came into 
my room, threw himself on the sofa, and nearly laughed himself to extinction, imitating again and again the pathetic tone of the Governor's greeting.

Mr. Chesnut calls Lawrence Adolphe, but says he is simply perfect as a servant. Mary Stevens said: " I 
thought Cousin James the laziest man alive until I knew his man, Lawrence." Lawrence will not move an inch or lift 
a finger for any one but his master. Mrs. Middleton politely sent him on an errand; Lawrence, too, was very polite; hours after, she saw him sitting on the fence of the front yard. Didn't you go ? " she asked. "No, ma am. 
I am waiting for Mars Jeems." Mrs. Middleton calls him now, " Mr. Take-it-Easy."

My very last day's experience at the Congaree. I was waiting for Mars Jeems in the drawing-room when a lady 
there declared herself to be the wife of an officer in Clingman's regiment. A gentleman who seemed quite friendly 
with her, told her all Mr. Chesnut said, thought, intended to do, wrote, and felt. I asked: " Are you certain of all 
these things you say of Colonel Chesnut? " The man hardly deigned to notice this impertinent interruption from 
a stranger presuming to speak but who had not been introduced! After he went out, the wife of Clingman's officer 
was seized with an intuitive curiosity. Madam, will you tell me your name? " I gave it, adding, " I dare say I 
showed myself an intelligent listener when my husband's affairs were under discussion. At first, I refused to give 
my name because it would have embarrassed her friend if she had told him who I was. The man was Mr. Chesnut's 
secretary, but I had never seen him before.

A letter from Kate says she had been up all night preparing David's things. Little Serena sat up and helped 
her mother. They did not know that they would ever see him again. Upon reading it, I wept and James Chesnut cursed the Yankees.

Gave the girls a quantity of flannel for soldiers shirts ; also a string of pearls to be raffled for at the Gunboat Fair. 
Mary Witherspoon has sent a silver tea-pot. We do not spare our precious things now. Our silver and gold, what 
are they? when we give up to war our beloved.
