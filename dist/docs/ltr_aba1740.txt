</p><p>
MY DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
T'is almost four months since you left your native land, and embarked upon the mighty waters, in quest 
of a foreign country. Although I have not particularly written to you since, yet you may be assured 
you have constantly been upon my heart and mind. 
</p><p>
It is a very difficult task, my dear son, for a tender parent to bring her mind to part with a child of 
your years going to a distant land ; nor could I have acquiesced in such a separation under any other care 
than that of the most excellent parent and guardian who accompanied you. You have arrived at years 
capable of improving under the advantages you will be likely to have, if you do but properly attend to 
them. They are talents put into your hands, of which an account will be required of you hereafter ; 
and, being possessed of one, two, or four, see to it that you double your numbers. 
</p><p>
The most amiable and most useful disposition in a young mind is diffidence of itself; and this should 
lead you to seek advice and instruction from him, who is your natural guardian, and will always counsel and direct you in the best manner, both for your present and future happiness. You are in possession of a natural good understanding, and of spirits unbroken by adversity and untamed with care. Improve your understanding by acquiring useful knowledge and virtue, such as will render you an ornament to society, an honor to your country, and a 
blessing to your parents. Great learning and superior abilities, should you ever possess them, will be 
of little value and small estimation, unless virtue, honor, truth, and integrity are added to them. Adhere to those religious sentiments and principles which were early instilled into your mind, and remember, that you are accountable to your Maker 
for all your words and actions. 
</p><p>
Let me enjoin it upon you to attend constantly and steadfastly to the precepts and instructions of <a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="spouse met">your father</a>, as you value the happiness of your mother and your own welfare. His care and attention to 
you render many things unnecessary for me to write, which I might otherwise do ; bat the inadvertency and heedlessness of youth require line upon 
line and precept upon precept, and, when enforced by the joint efforts of both parents, will, I hope, have a due influence upon your conduct ; for, dear as you are to me, I would much rather you should have 
found your grave in the ocean you have crossed, or that any untimely death crop you in your infant years, than see you an immoral, profligate, or grace less child. 
</p><p>
You have entered early in life upon the great theatre of the world, which is full of temptations and vice of every kind. You are not wholly unacquainted with history, in which you have read of 
crimes which your inexperienced mind could scarcely believe credible. You have been taught to think of them with horror, and to view vice as 
</p><p>
" a monster of so frightful mien, 
That, to be hated, needs but to be seen." 
</p><p>
Yet you must keep a strict guard upon yourself, or the odious monster will soon lose its terror by be 
coming familiar to you. The modern history of our own times, furnishes as black a list of crimes, as can 
be paralleled in ancient times, even if we go back to Nero, Caligula, or Caesar Borgia. Young as you 
are, the cruel war, into which we have been compelled by the haughty tyrant of Britain and the bloody 
emissaries of his vengeance, may stamp upon your mind this certain truth, that the welfare and prosperity of all countries, communities, and, I may add, 
individuals, depend upon their morals. That nation to which we were once united, as it has departed 
from justice, eluded and subverted the wise laws which formerly governed it, and suffered the worst 
of crimes to go unpunished, has lost its valor, wisdom, and humanity, and, from being the dread and 
terror of Europe, has sunk into derision and infamy. 
</p><p>
But, to quit political subjects, I have been greatly anxious for your safety, having never heard of the 
frigate since she sailed, till, about a week ago, a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> paper informed, that she was taken and 
carried into Plymouth. I did not fully credit this report, though it gave me much uneasiness. I yesterday heard that a French vessel was arrived at 
Portsmouth, which brought news of the safe arrival of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> ; but this wants confirmation. I hope 
it will not be long before I shall be assured of your safety. You must write me an account of your 
voyage, of your situation, and of every thing entertaining you can recollect. 
</p><p>
Be assured I am most affectionately yours, 
</p>
