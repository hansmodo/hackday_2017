Dear Brother: I read carefully your speech, 1 and your 
reasoning is very close ; much more so than Thurman's 
and others, and I was glad you could make so good a 
defence. I know that our soldiers hate that kind of duty 
terribly, and not one of those officers but would prefer to 
go to the plains against the Indians, rather than encounter a street mob, or serve a civil process. 
</p><p>
But in our government it is too hard for our troops to 
stand up in the face of what is apparent : that the present 
government of Louisiana is not the choice of the people, 
though in strict technical law it is the State government. 
I recognize the great necessity of standing by the lawful 
State government, but the soldiers do not. The quicker 
you allow the people to select their own governors the 
better, and if necessary pile on the effort to secure a fair 
election, and prevent intimidation of voters. 
</p><p>
I was always embarrassed by the plain, palpable fact, 
that the Union whites are cowardly, and allow the rebel 
element that loves to fight, to cow them. Until the 
Union whites, and negroes too, fight for their own rights 
they will be trodden down. Outside help sooner or later 
must cease, for our army is ridiculously small, in case of 
actual collision. It is only the memory of our war power, 
that operates on the rebel element now. They have the 
votes, the will, and will in the end prevail. Delay only 
gives them sympathy elsewhere. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately,
