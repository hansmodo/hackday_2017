I HAVE no time nor accommodation to write of late ; 
besides, I. seldom know what to write, and when I do, 
I don't love to write it. One thing is now becoming 
more and more certain every day, that is, that our 
people will and do fight. And although they make a 
clumsy hand of it, yet they do better and better.

I am lodged in the house of General Roberdeau, an 
Israelite indeed, I believe, who with his sisters and 
children and servants does every thing to make us happy. We are highly favored. No other delegates are 
so well off. I am as well as usual. Your dream 
will never come to pass. You never can be coolly 
received by me while my heart beats and my senses 
remain.

I had no letter from you by the last post. 
Yours, yours, yours.
