Miriam and Mattie drove in, in the little buggy, 
last evening after sunset, to find out what we 
were to do. Our condition is desperate.  <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel=''>Beauregard</a> 
is about attacking these Federals. They say he is 
coming from Corinth, and the fight will be in town. 
If true, we are lost again. Starvation at Green well, 
fever and bullets here, will put an end to us soon 
enough. There is no refuge for us, no one to consult. 
Brother, whose judgment we rely on as implicitly 
as we did on father's, we hear has gone to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ; 
there is no one to advise or direct us, for, if he is gone, 
there is no man in Louisiana whose decision I would 
blindly abide by. Let us stay and die. We can only 
die once ; we can suffer a thousand deaths with sus 
pense and uncertainty ; the shortest is the best. Do 
you think the few words here can give an idea of our 
agony and despair? Nothing can express it. I feel 
a thousand years old to-day. I have shed the bitterest tears to-day that I have shed since father died. 
I can't stand it much longer; I'll give way presently, 
and I know my heart will break. Shame ! Where is 
God? A fig for your religion, if it only lasts while 
the sun shines! " Better days are coming" I 
can t! 
</p><p>
Troops are constantly passing and repassing. They have scoured the country for ten miles out, in search of guerrillas. We are here without servants, 
clothing, or the bare necessaries of life : suppose they should seize them on the way ! I procured a pass for the wagon, but it now seems doubtful if I can get 
the latter a very faint chance. Well ! let them go ; our home next; then we can die sure enough. With God's help, I can stand anything yet in store for me. 
"I hope to die shouting, the Lord will provide!" Poor Lavinia ! if she could only see us ! I am glad she does not know our condition. 
</p><p>
5 P.M. 
</p><p>
What a day of agony, doubt, uncertainty, and despair ! Heaven save me from another such ! Every hour fresh difficulties arose, until I believe we were 
almost crazy, every one of us.

As Miriam was about stepping in the buggy, to go to Greenwell to bring in our trunks, mother's heart misgave her, and she decided to sacrifice her property 
rather than remain in this state any longer. After 
a desperate discussion which proved that each argument was death, she decided to go back to Greenwell and give up the keys of the house to General Williams, and let him do as he pleased, rather than 
have it broken open during her absence. Mattie and Mr. Tunnard were present at the discussion, which 
ended by the latter stepping in the buggy and driving Miriam to the Garrison. General Williams called 
her by name, and asked her about Major Drum. It 
seems all these people, native and foreign, know us, 
while we know none. Miriam told him our condition, how our brothers were away, father dead, and 
mother afraid to remain, yet unwilling to lose her 
property by going away; how we three were alone 
and unprotected here, but would remain rather than 
have our home confiscated. He assured her the house 
should not be touched, that it would be respected in our absence as though we were in it, and he would 
place a sentinel at the door to guard it against his 
own men who might be disposed to enter. The latter 
she declined, but he said he would send his aide to 
mark the house, that it might be known. A moment 
after they got back, the aide, Mr. Biddle (I have his 
name to so many passes that I know it now), came 
to the door. Mr. Tunnard left him there, uncertain 
how we would receive a Christian, and I went out 
and asked him in. He looked uncertain of his reception, too, when we put an end to his doubt by treating him as we invariably treat gentlemen who appear 
such. He behaved remarkably well under the trying circumstances, and insisted on a sentinel; for, 
he said, though they would respect the property, 
there were many bad characters among the soldiers 
who might attempt to rob it, and the sentinel would 
protect it. After a visit of ten minutes, devoted exclusively to the affair, he arose and took his leave, 
leaving me under the impression that he was a gentleman wherever he came from, even if there were 
a few grammatical errors in the pass he wrote me 
yesterday; but "thou that judgest another, dost thou sin?" 
</p><p>
Well, now we say, fly to Greenwell. Yes! and by 
to-night, a most exaggerated account of the whole 
affair will be spread over the whole country, and we 
will be equally suspected by our own people. Those 
who spread useless falsehoods about us will gladly 
have a foundation for a monstrous one. Didn't 
Camp Moore ring with the story of our entertaining 
the Federal officers? Didn't they spread the report 
that Miriam danced with one to the tune of "Yankee Doodle" in the State House garden? What will 
they stop at now? O ! if I was only a man, and knew 
what to do! Night. 
</p><p>
We were so distressed by the false position in 
which we would be placed by a Federal sentinel, 
that we did not know what course to pursue. As all 
our friends shook their heads and said it was dangerous, we knew full well what our enemies would say. 
If we win <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>, as I pray we will, they will 
say we asked protection from Yankees against our 
own men, are consequently traitors, and our property will be confiscated by our own Government. 
To decline General Williams's kind offer exposes the 
house to being plundered. In our dilemma, we made 
up our minds to stay, so we could say the sentinel 
was unnecessary. 
</p><p>
Presently a file of six soldiers marched to the gate, 
an officer came to the steps and introduced himself as 
Colonel McMillan, of 21st Indiana Volunteers. He 
asked if this was Mrs. Morgan s; the General had 
ordered a guard placed around the house; he would 
suggest placing them in different parts of the yard. 
"Madam, the pickets await your orders." Miriam 
in a desperate fright undertook to speak for mother, 
and asked if he thought there was any necessity. 
No, but it was an additional security, he said. 
"Then, if no actual necessity, we will relieve you of 
the disagreeable duty, as we expect to remain in 
town," she said. He was very kind, and discussed the 
whole affair with us, saying when we made up our 
minds to leave, we told him after we could not 
decide, to write him word, and he would place 
a guard around to prevent his men and the negroes 
from breaking in. It was a singular situation: our 
brothers off fighting them, while these Federal officers 
leaned over our fence, and an officer standing on our 
steps offered to protect us. These people are certainly very kind to us. General Williams especially 
must be a dear old gentleman; he is so good. 
</p><p>
How many good, and how many mean people 
these troubles have shown us! I am beginning to 
see my true friends, now ; there is a large number of 
them, too. Everybody from whom we least expected 
attention has agreeably surprised us. . . . 
</p><p>
General Williams will believe we are insane from 
our changing so often. 
</p><p>
His guard positively refused.
