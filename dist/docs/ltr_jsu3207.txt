DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am now moving to <a href='/results.php?city=pompton' rel='city'>Pompton</a>, agreeably to your Excellency's orders of yesterday. I find that the 
whole of the Rhode Island army is encamped on Staten Island, in addition to the troops before stationed there ; that they are making preparations for an excursion somewhere, and it is generally conjectured 
that they intend a descent upon the Jersey shore. 
This conjecture seems to be strengthened by the 
light-horse being sent on to the Island, and the preparations they are making in the boat way. If the 
forage is their object, will our troops at <a href='/results.php?city=pompton' rel='city'>Pompton</a> be 
within sufficient distance to give a timely opposition? 
May not the magazines at Pluckamin be an object? 
I see the disadvantage which may arise from this di 
vision of the army being sent at too great a distance 
from the others, and beg pardon for the above hints, 
which are only intended to express my wishes to be 
in such a situation as may enable me effectually to 
answer your Excellency's wishes. The place which 
will best answer this purpose, your Excellency can 
best determine. I have the honor to be, with the 
most perfect respect, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jsu" rel="me">JOHN SULLIVAN</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I have not a horseman, or any thing in place 
of one, for expresses, or any other purpose.
