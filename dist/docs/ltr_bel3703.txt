jMy dear General, 
</p><p>
I was honored with your favor of this date at half 
past one, at the Landing. We have put, and are putting on board the vessels, the ordnance, ordnance stores, &c. I shall send, in the same vessels, the corps 
of artillery, corps of sappers and miners, and also 
General Hazen's regiment. By sending General Hazen's regiment, I suppose it will be unnecessary to 
send the hundred men you mentioned. I thought it 
was best to send whole corps, and not a detachment, 
as the former mode would fully comply with the 
spirit of your orders. The vessels, I expect, will leave 
this at about seven o'clock, so as to be down early 
in the morning. I have ordered them to wait on 
your Excellency for further orders. 
</p><p>
The light troops, the Jersey brigade, and Colonel Van Schaick, will leave this in the morning. As 
there are so many empty wagons, I think the troops, 
with their aid, will march with ease and despatch. 
This idea, and the necessity the French will have 
for the vessels, have induced me to send none by 
water, saving the invalids and those before mentioned. 
I shall detain one vessel to receive such of the stores 
as are in our rear with Colonel Cortlandt, and may 
not be exposed to rain. The other stores and the 
troops can go on in the same boats they have with 
them. their wagons will be made light, and sent 
round. The moment I have made the necessary arrangements, I will follow the troops, and wait on 
your Excellency at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. I am, dear General, 
With the greatest respect, yours, most obediently, 
</p><p>
Benjai\iin Lincoln.
