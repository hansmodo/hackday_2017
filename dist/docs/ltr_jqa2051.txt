THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, December 21, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1794">1794</a>.

We have at this moment a rumor, which has darted like 
lightning through the whole Province of Holland, and which 
is propagated in such a manner, that there can be no doubt 
but it is indirectly countenanced by the Court. It is that 
two commissioners are appointed to proceed immediately 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> for the negotiation of a peace, and Mr. Brantzen, 
the former ambassador extraordinary in France, and Mr. 
Repelaer, a burgomaster of Dort, are named as the persons. 
This intelligence is probably not true, . . . because it is 
hardly conceivable that Britain should consent to a separate 
negotiation on the part of this country, or that she should 
join in a general negotiation as yet; and it is equally 
difficult to suppose that the court here, that is the governing 
power, should so far disencumber itself from British thraldom, as to negotiate separately and in a public manner for 
peace without their consent. . . .

Among the difficulties with which the government is 
compelled to struggle, the want of money is one of the most 
important. The weight of taxation with which these 
Provinces are burdened in ordinary times is well known to 
you. It has already been aggravated to the extremity of 
sufferance, yet the public treasury is empty. The public 
credit of course is proportionably impaired. The obligations of the Province of Holland, which you have always 
known at par, and generally higher, have depreciated to 55 
and even 50 per cent. New loans have been attempted 
and totally failed. The dangerous and extreme resource 
of a paper currency has already been resorted to, and an 
emission of five millions of guilders has taken place to supply 
the impending contingency of public payments. The circulation of this paper, it is said, will be voluntary as to the 
people in general, and compulsive only upon the persons in 
office. But this regulation must be intended only to facili 
tate the introduction of the paper to the public, and there is 
little reason to doubt that its acceptance in all payments will 
be enforced very soon by the sanction of the Law. . . .

I perceive that the Dutch resident at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> does 
not write to his constituents so frequently, nor give them 
so particular accounts of American affairs, as would be neces 
sary to give them entire satisfaction. If he is well disposed 
towards our country, and would be likely to make a just 
representation of things, I could wish he had some friend 
who should in a delicate manner intimate this circumstance 
to him. It would certainly render him a service, and might 
be useful to the interests of the United States.
