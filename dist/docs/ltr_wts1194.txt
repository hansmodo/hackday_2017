Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
Yesterday it rained very hard, whereby the telegraph 
was interrupted so that our despatches are mutilated. 
Yet they contain enough to show that impeachment was 
not made final by the vote of Saturday. I notice that 
some feeling is exhibited against Henderson. I believe, 
of course, that he has been actuated by the best and most 
honorable motives. He certainly carefully heard every 
word of testimony, and all the arguments, and if these 
led him to the conclusion that the case was not [made] 
out, he was bound to vote accordingly. If party discipline is to ride down a man's sense of honor and right, 
</p><p>
Republican government cannot and should not last many 
years. 
</p><p>
In our Indian matters I think we are making as much 
progress as could be expected. The great bulk of the 
Sioux have agreed to move to the Missouri where they 
will be too far away from the railroad to be provoked to 
do it damage, and where the appropriations for their 
benefit can be more economically and faithfully applied. 
Some small bands will always be warlike and mischievous, but the game of war will be simplified by their separation. The same as to the Cheyennes, etc., below the 
Arkansas. The commission for present peace had to concede a right to hunt buffaloes as long as they last, and 
this may lead to collisions, but it will not be long before 
all the buffaloes are extinct near and between the railroads, after which the Indians will have no reason to 
approach either railroad. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately,
