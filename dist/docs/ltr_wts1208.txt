HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES,

Dear Brother : . . . Don't ever give any person the 
least encouragement to think I can be used for political 
ends. I have seen it poison so many otherwise good 
characters, that I am really more obstinate than ever. I 
think Grant will be made miserable to the end of his life 
by his eight years' experience. Let those who are trained 
to it keep the office, and keep the Army and Navy as free 
from politics as possible, for emergencies that may arise 
at any time.

Think of the reputations wrecked in politics since <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1865">1865</a>. 
Yours affectionately,
