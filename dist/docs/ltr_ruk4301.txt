Sir, 
</p><p>
I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 
22d of December. Count Rumford being in Bavaria, 
I have requested the Minister of that country at this 
Court to forward your letter to the Count with his next 
despatch. I have delivered to Mr. Fulton the letter for 
him, and, as soon as Sir John Sinclair returns to town, 
I will also deliver the letter addressed to him. I have 
before sent two copies of the Gazette, containing the 
publication of the Chancery order that you inclosed 
to me for that purpose. By this opportunity I transmit a third.

Our affairs here, relative to the execution of the treaty, are in a good train. Some delays and difficulties have existed, but they exist no longer, and 
the Commissioners are going on in a satisfactory manner. In the conferences that I have had "uith this 
Government, upon these and other topics, I have 
found them candid and impartial, in as great a degree as I had expected. Several important points, 
not settled by the treaty, still remain open, and both 
time and patience are requisite, even now, to form a 
safe opinion, how far we shall in the end, be able to 
agree. I think I am not deceived in supposing, that 
a sincere and general desire exists in this country to 
live in harmony and friendship with us. This disposition is, however, fettered and enfeebled by prejudices, and opinions connected with the national commerce and marine, which make the Government slow 
and cautious in every step which has a reference to 
these important concerns.

Some uneasiness has been manifest here for some 
few weeks past, concerning the situation of the British territories in the East Indies. It is not very 
easy to obtain good information upon this subject, 
but there is reason to believe, that much disaffection 
exists among the native troops in the Company's service. The establishment is understood to be twenty 
thousand Europeans, and sixty thousand native or 
black troops. Whatever the origin of these discontents may have been (and they are supposed to be 
of several years' standing), they have lately risen to 
such a pitch, that the Local Government of India has 
been compelled first to temporize, and then, as is 
commonly the consequence, to submit to measures 
they were unable to prevent. Lord Cornwallis is 
suddenly to be sent to Bengal, and with such extensive powers as, it is hoped, will enable him to restore 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> tranquillity. What may be his success, my want of 
accurate information forbids me to conjecture. 
</p><p>
From the continent, as a balance to the glory acquired by the Arch Duke, we have just received the accounts of the astonishing victories lately gained by 
Bonaparte in Lombardy. The immediate consequences must be the fall of ^lantua, and the easy subjugation of the South of Italy. 
</p><p>
Whether these victories, or any recent information from America, have had any influence with the Directory, respecting the situation of <a href='/results.php?tla=ccp' rel=''>General Pinckney</a>, 
remains to be ascertained ; but I have this morning been informed, by letters from Paris, that, on the 28th 
ultimo, the General was ordered by the Directory to leave Paris, and that he intended to depart on the 31st for Amsterdam. 
</p><p>
With perfect respect, &c., 
</p><p>
