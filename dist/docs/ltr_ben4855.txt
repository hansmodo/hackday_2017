DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I made a little extract from yours of April 27, of the number 
of slaves imported and perishing, with some close remarks 
on the hypocrisy of this country, which encourages such a 
detestable commerce by laws for promoting the Guinea trade ; 
while it piqued itself on its virtue, love of liberty, and the 
equity of its courts, in setting free a single negro. This was 
inserted in the London Chronicle, of the 2Oth of June last. 
</p><p>
I thank you for the Virginia address, which I shall also 
publish with some remarks. I am glad to hear that the disposition against keeping negroes grows more general in North 
America. Several pieces have been lately printed here 
against the practice, and I hope in time it will be taken into 
consideration and suppressed by the legislature. Your 
labours have already been attended with great effects. I 
hope, therefore, you and your friends will be encouraged 
to proceed. My hearty wishes of success attend you, being 
</p><p>
ever, my dear friend, yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
