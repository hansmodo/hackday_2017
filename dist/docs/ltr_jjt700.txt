My Dear Sister,
</p><p>
Ellie & myself hope to be with you this day week (Saturday).

I wish you would say to Mrs. Hillie that I have failed in my efforts to procure her any assistance. I much regret this. I do not know of any person belonging to the Staunton Lodge who would have been more likely of success than Mr. Watts, the gentleman to whom I entrusted it.
</p><p>
Excuse this hasty note as I am much pressed with business. Mr. Bledsoe of Kentucky was elected at the University to the chair for which I was a candidate.
Your Brother <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jjt" rel="me">Thomas</a>

My dear Laura,
</p><p>
The Major is so busy with his duties at the Institute that he has commissioned me to finish this letter for him. Indeed, I have scarcely seen him today. He wishes me to say to you that he hopes you will not exert yourself by making any preparations to receive us; he does not want you to weary yourself or injure your health on our account. The weather is so extremely warm just now that we quite fear the ride in stage, but we hope to find it cooler further among the mountains.<br/>
Yours affect.<br/>
Ellie Jackson
