My Dear Brother : I acknowledged the receipt of your 
last in my letter to mother, since which time I have 
been waiting in hopes that something might turn up to 
write you about ; but although the river has opened, and 
is alive with steamboats and sloops, still <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=west point" rel="city">West Point</a> 
appears as dull as ever ; in fact, the only visitors we 
have had so far have been tailors, shoemakers, etc., etc., 
who prowl about us, knowing our inexperience and the 
necessity we are under of getting a full supply of clothing at their prices. The snow has entirely disappeared, 
and for the past three weeks the weather has been beautiful, and reminds me very much of sugar-making times 
at home, and I have no doubt, if your weather has been 
as fine as ours here, your farmers have not been idle 
in their camps. An evening at old Mr. Buchanan's or 
Wilson's sugar-camp would be great.

I presume the idea of your studying law has been 
decided upon by Mr. Reese and Taylor, so that it would 
be rather impertinent for me to object in the least} but 
for my part, it would be my last choice. Everybody 
studies law nowadays, and to be a lawyer without being 
exceedingly eminent which it is to be hoped you will 
be some day is not a sufficient equivalent for their 
risks and immense study and labor. However, if you 
decide upon anything, you should immediately commence 
to carry it into execution. As to me, I am already provided for. As soon as I graduate I am entitled by law 
to a commission in the army, and from my standing in 
the class to a choice of corps. To be stationed in the 
east or west, to be in the artillery, infantry, or dragoons, 
depends entirely on my choice. This choice will be, 
unless war breaks out with England, the Fifth Regiment 
of Infantry, because it is stationed on the northwest 
frontier, a country which I have always felt a strong 
inclination to see ; and if it meets my ideas, formed from 
descriptions of travellers and officers, it must be the 
finest spot on this continent. Also it is probable that 
the Indians will break out again, in which case I should 
have an opportunity of seeing some active service. 
Should war, however, be the consequence of this Maine 
difficulty, I should prefer the artillery, for the reason 
that it is stationed east of the mountains, which would 
be the seat of war, and it is an arm of service which I 
would prefer in a war against a civilized people. But as 
there is scarce a possibility of this, I have concluded to go 
to the west, and have accordingly ordered an infantry uniform. Whether I remain in the army for life or not is 
doubtful ; but one thing is certain, that I will never study 
another profession. Should I resign, it would be to turn 
farmer, if ever I can raise enough to buy a good farm in 
Iowa. ... If I can spare money when I am at the city 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, I intend to get one of Colt's patent rifles 
to shoot ten times in succession as fast as you can cock 
and pull the trigger. They cost from $40 to $60, more 
than, I fear, I can spare. I have been very well indeed all 
winter. Your affectionate brother,
