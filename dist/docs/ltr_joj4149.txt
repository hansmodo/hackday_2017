Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I received, three days ago, by the post, your letter of the 
7th of August, in which was a copy of the one you had 
written on the 20th of July, and the original of which I had 
received and read with pleasure. 
</p><p>
The difficulty and delicacy of your task, my good friend, 
are obvious; but I natter myself the reputation to be derived 
from it will soften the trouble and anxiety it gives you. It 
was not to be expected that the judgments of the commissioners would not frequently differ, for the best judges 
sometimes vary in opinion from each other ; but it is to be 
expected, as well as wished, that their decisions may bear 
the test of the severe examination which they will certainly 
at one time or other undergo.

The delays of the court of admiralty do not surprise me. 
I have no faith in any British court of admiralty, though I 
have the greatest respect for, and the highest confidence in 
their courts of justice, in the number of which, those courts 
do not deserve to be ranked. I do not extend this stricture 
to the lords of appeal. 
</p><p>
The question you hint at is interesting. Perhaps a mode 
might be devised for making and receiving claims de bene esse; but if any thing of that kind should be done, it should 
be on more mature consideration than that on which I suggest it ; it is a thought which just occurred to me, and 
which I have not examined. 
</p><p>
I am settled here with my family, at least for the winter. 
The Legislature have determined that this city shall be the 
seat of government, and that the principal public offices 
shall be here. 
</p><p>
As to politics, we are in a better state than we were : 
but we are not yet in a sound state. I think that nation is 
not in a sound state whose parties are excited by objects 
interesting only to a foreign power. I wish to see our 
people more Americanized, if I may use that expression; 
until we feel and act as an independent nation, we shall 
always suffer from foreign intrigue. 
</p><p>
Whether peace in Europe would ensure peace to America, 
is a question on which doubts are entertained. In my opinion, 
it will depend on circumstances, and not on any right or 
wrong about the matter. 
</p><p>
Remember me to our friends, <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='colleague met'>Mr. King</a>, and Mr. Gore. 
I owe letters to them, and to others, but the fate of letters 
has been so precarious, that I have written much fewer 
than I should otherwise have done. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, yours sincerely, 
</p><p>
