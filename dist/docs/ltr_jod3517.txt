MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
LAST night an express from M. de Sartines, whose politeness upon this occasion was very obliging, brought 
me your letters of September 29th and October 10th. 
The joy which the receipt of these packets afforded 
me, was damped by the disagreeable articles of intelligence, but still more so by the symptoms of grief 
and complaint which appeared in the letters. For 
heaven's sake, my dear, don t indulge a thought that 
it is possible for me to neglect or forget all that is 
dear to me in this world. It is impossible for me to 
write as I did in America. What should I write ? It 
is not safe to write any thing that one is not willing 
should go into all the newspapers of the world. I 
know not by whom to write. I never know what conveyance is safe. Vessels may have arrived without 
letters from me. I am five hundred miles from Bordeaux, and not much less distant from Nantes. I 
know nothing of many vessels that go from the sea 
ports, and if I knew of all, there are some that I should 
not trust. Notwithstanding this, I have written to you 
not much less than fifty letters. I am astonished that 
you have received no more. But almost every vessel 
has been taken. Two vessels by which I sent goods 
to you for the use of your family, and one by which I sent Mr. Cranch's things, we know, have been taken. 
In every one of these I sent large packets of letters 
and papers for Congress, for you, and for many 
friends. God knows I don t spend my time in idleness, or in gazing at curiosities. I never wrote more 
letters, however empty they may have been. But by 
what I hear, they have been all, or nearly all, taken 
or sunk. My friends complain that they have not received letters from me. I may as well complain. I 
have received scarcely any letters from America. I 
have written three where I have received one. From 
my friend, <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='me'>Mr. Adams</a>, I have received only one 
short card ; from Mr. Gerry, not a syllable ; from Mr. Lovell, only two or three, very short. What shall I 
say ? I doubt not they have written oftener, but letters miscarry. Drs. Cooper and Gordon write to Dr. 
Franklin, not to me. My friend Warren has been 
good as usual. I have received several fine, long 
letters, full of sound sense, useful intelligence, and 
reflections as virtuous, as wise as usual from him. 
I have answered them and written more, but whether 
they arrive, I know not. 
</p><p>
I approve very much of your draught upon me in 
favor of your cousin. The moment it arrives, it shall 
be paid. Draw for more as you may have occasion. 
But make them give you gold and silver for your 
bills. Your son is the joy of my heart, without abating in the least degree of my affection for the young 
rogue that did not seem as if he had a father, or his 
brother or sister. Tell Abby her papa likes her the 
better for what she tells her brother, viz, : " that she 
don t talk much," because I know she thinks and 
feels the more. I hope the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> has arrived. She 
carried many things for you. 
</p><p>
Last night a friend from England brought me the 
King's speech. Their delirium continues, and they 
go on with the war, but the speech betrays a manifest expectation that Spain will join against them, 
and the debates betray a dread of Holland. They 
have reason for both. They have not and cannot get 
an ally. They cannot send any considerable reinforcement to America. 
</p><p>
Your reflections upon the rewards of the virtuous 
friends of the public are very just. But if virtue was 
to be rewarded with wealth, it would not be virtue. If 
virtue was to be rewarded with fame, it would not be 
virtue of the sublimest kind. Who would not rather 
be Fabricius than Csesar ? Who would not rather be 
Aristides than even William the Third ? Who ! No 
body would be of this mind but Aristides and Fabricius. These characters are very rare, but the more 
precious. Nature has made more insects than birds, 
more butterflies than eagles, more foxes than lions, 
more pebbles than diamonds. The most excellent of 
her productions both in the physical, intellectual and 
moral world, are the most rare. I would not be a 
butterfly because children run after them, nor because 
dull philosophers boast of them in their cabinets. 
</p><p>
Have you ever read J. J. Rousseau ? If not, read him. 
Your cousin Smith has him. What a difference between him and Chesterfield and even Voltaire ? But 
he was too virtuous for the age and for Europe. I wish I could not say for another country. 
</p><p>
I am much disappointed in not receiving despatches from Congress by this opportunity. We expect alterations in the plan here. What will be done 
with me I can t conjecture. If I am recalled, I 
will endeavor to get a safe opportunity home. I 
will watch the proper season, and look out for a good 
vessel. And if I can get safe to Penn's hill, shall 
never repent of my voyage to Europe, because I have 
gained an insight into several things that I never 
should have understood without it. 
</p><p>
I pray you to remember me with every sentiment 
of tenderness, duty and affection to your father and 
my mother, your and my brothers and sisters, uncles, 
aunts, cousins, and every body else that you know 
deserves it. What shall I say too of my dear young 
friends by your fireside ? May God Almighty bless 
them and make them wise !
