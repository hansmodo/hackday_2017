DEAR SIR, On our Journey hither, we have fallen in with 
the bearer of the Electoral votes of Georgia. They are unanimous as to the President, and are all thrown away on Individuals of the State as to the Vice president. The Representatives 
were not chosen when the gentleman set out, but the election 
was to take place in a day or two after. General Matthews, 
he tells us, will be one, Mr. Baldwin another, and the third 
either Mr. Osborne or Gen Jackson. All the candidates, I 
understand, are well affected to the Constitution. In South 
Carolina the votes for President were also unanimous, as the 
gentleman informs us. Of the others, 5 were given to Mr. Rutledge, and the remaining two to Mr. Adams. 
</p><p>
The badness of the roads and the weather prevented our getting to this place sooner than last evening, by which means we 
lose two days. R. H. Lee left this on his way to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> 
on Monday morning. Mr. White had preceded him a day or 
two. 
</p><p>
With the highest respect and mo. affect, attachment, I am, 
</p><p>
D'r Sir, Y'rs .
