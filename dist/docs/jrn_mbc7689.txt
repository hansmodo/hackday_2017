<a rel='month origin' value='1'>January</a> <a rel='day origin' value='12'>12th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. To-night there will be & great gathering of Kentuckians. Morgan gives them a dinner. The city of 
Richmond entertains John Morgan. He is at free quarters. The girls dined here. Conny Gary came back for more 
white feathers. Isabella had appropriated two sets and obstinately refused Constance Gary a single feather from 
her pile. She said, sternly : " I have never been on the stage before, and I have a presentiment when my father hears of 
this, I will never go again. I am to appear before the foot lights as an English dowager duchess, and I mean to rustle 
in every feather, to wear all the lace and diamonds these two houses can compass " (mine and Mrs. Preston s). 
She was jolly but firm, and Constance departed without any additional plumage for her Lady Teazle.
