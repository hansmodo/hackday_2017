On Sunday, July 13, the Sonora Vigilance Committee hung another horse thief. The following Sunday three Mexicans were tied to the whipping post, and each received twenty-five lashes well laid on. Another Mexican was found with a stolen horse in his possession, and sentenced to receive 150 lashes, to have one-half of his head shaved, and to leave the country in 48 hours under penalty of being hanged if he ever returned.

I have sold out my interest in the Herald at a fair price and am now permanently engaged as printer and Deputy Recorder at a salary sufficient to save over one hundred dollars per month. My prospects are brighter than they have been at any time since my arrival in California. About the first of next February, the two years' period will expire, at the end of which I was to make payment to Mr. Evans. After that the whole of my gains will be my own.

Sonora is a fast place and no mistake. Such a motley collection as we have here can be found nowhere but in California. Sonora has a population hailing from every hole and corner of the globeKanakas, Peruvians, Negroes, Spaniards, Mexicans, Chilians, Chinese, British convicts from New South Wales, known as "Sidney Birds," Englishmen, Frenchmen, Dutch, Paddies, and not a small sprinkling of Yankees. We have more gamblers, more drunkards, more ugly, bad women, and larger lumps of gold, and more of them, than any other place of similar dimensions within Uncle Sam's dominions. The Sabbath is regarded as a holiday,
granting men and women a more extensive license to practice vice than any other day in the week.

I feel that I am a rover, a wanderer on the face of the earth! In a land flowing, not with milk and honey, but with flapjacks and gold dust, far from home and kindred, and surrounded by the offscourings and scum of society, from all parts of the inhabitable globe. All selfish, each for himself, and his Satanic Majesty for all. I have scarcely met with half a dozen respectable women, or men with their families, since I left the Atlantic States. The women of other nations, what few there are, are nearly all lewd harlots, who are drunk half the time, or sitting behind the gambling table dealing monte. To see a woman who can read and write is a curiosity. Indeed, the majority of our females are a disgrace to woman. All, all ruined!

This state of things, I hope, will not last much longer, for every steamer which arrives in San Francisco brings many families of wives and children, and as soon as we get a few of them among us, a new order of things will commence.

The weather now is extremely warm. We are in the dry season and will have no rain for many months. The day has been awful hot, the mercury standing at 115 in the shade, and I must go and have a bath, paying $1.50 for it.
