EVER DEAR AND VALUED FRIENDS, 
</p><p>
Your notes giving us an account of your progress on the water were grateful, indeed, but the news of your safe arrival in 
France infinitely more so. Many, many are the questions that rise to my lips. 
How did you bear the voyage ? How is dear Clara, Mr. Barlow, et cetera ? I hope 
soon to know these things, which I confess interest me more than the success of 
your mission, of which few have a doubt. Even the enemies of our Minister admit 
his talents and virtue ; how then can anyone doubt ? We passed two months on our 
mountain in health and peace, returning the first of October to a sick and afflicted 
city. The unfinished canal caused a bilious fever to prevail through all its 
streets ; many died, and Congress convened in dread of contagion. Happily all 
fear is now over, and public business engrosses them very thoroughly. John Randolph is the only one as yet who seems 
hostile to a quiet " House." They have 
before them the nomination of Colonel M. and some lesser appointments, and I believe are in a disposition to do as they are advised.

The French Minister, Mr. Serurier, is still delighted with Kalorama, and takes 
much pleasure in beautifying the grounds. Mrs. Baldwin was well and cheerful when 
I saw her some days since ; she no doubt is writing you volumes, and keeps you 
posted as to the health of your little dog. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="spouse met">Mr. Madison</a> is writing also, and will tell 
you that he has settled the business of the Chesapeake with Mr. Foster. I have not 
yet begun the journal I promised, having nothing worth relating. Mr. Barlow knows 
the disposition of our world better than I do, and from what I learn, good sense and 
principle will prevail over intrigue and vanity. You will see that Calvin declares himself the author of the boasted letters : 
some think this a finishing stroke, but I absolutely pity the man, " fallen from 
his high estate." We have new members in abundance, with their wives and daughters ; and I have never felt the entertainment of company oppressive until now. 
How I wish I were in France with you for a little relaxation. As you, my dear friends, 
have everything and we nothing that is beautiful, I will ask the favor of you to 
send me by a safe vessel large head dresses, a few flowers, feathers, gloves, and 
stockings, black and white, with anything else pretty, and suitable for an economist, 
and let me know the amount. We have a house full of company, and I must conclude with love and prayers for you all, my 
best friends. 
</p><p>
Affectionately,
