My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On Tuesday last, I returned from my tour to the westward. On Monday, Congress by adjournment are to meet; 
and on the day following, Mr. Bayard, according to his 
present expectation, is to leave this city for London. 
Thus circumstanced (having so little time between my 
return and the opening of the session, to examine papers, 
and to prepare my communications for the Legislature), 
you will readily perceive that my present address to you 
must be hurried ; at the same time, my friendship and regard for you would not let an opportunity so good as the 
one afforded by Mr. Bayard, pass without some testimony 
of my remembrance, and an acknowledgment of the receipt of your private letters to me, dated the 23d of June, 
21st of July, and 5th and 11th of August. These comprehend all the letters I have received from you since your 
arrival in England to the present date. 
</p><p>
That of the 5th of August dawns more favourably upon 
the success of your mission than any that had preceded it, 
and for the honour, dignity, and interest of this country; 
for your own reputation and glory ; and for the peculiar 
satisfaction I should derive from it, as well on private as 
on public considerations, no man more ardently wishes you 
complete success than I do. But, as you have observed in 
some of your letters, that it is hardly possible in the early 
stages of a negotiation to foresee all the results, so much 
depending upon fortuitous circumstances, and incidents 
which are not within our control, â€” so to deserve success, by 
employing the means with which we are possessed to the 
best advantage, and trusting the event to the all-wise Disposer, is all that an enlightened public, and the virtuous 
and well-disposed part of the community can reasonably 
expect ; nor in this, will they, I am sure, be disappointed. 
Against the malignancy of the discontented, the turbulent, 
and the vicious, no abilities, no exertions, nor the most unshaken integrity are any safeguard. 
</p><p>
As far as depends upon the executive, measures preparatory for the worst, while it hopes for the best, will be pursued; and I shall endeavour to keep things in statu quo, 
until your negotiation assumes a more decisive form, which 
I hope will soon be the case, as there are many hot heads and impetuous spirits among us, who with difficulty can be 
kept within bounds. This, however, ought not to precipitate your conduct ; for, as it has been observed, " there is a 
tide in human affairs," which ought to be watched; and because I believe all who are acquainted with you will 
readily concede, that considerations both public and private combine to urge you to bring your mission to a close, with as much celerity as the nature of it will admit. 
</p><p>
As you have been, and will continue to be fully informed 
by the secretary of state of all transactions of a public 
nature, which relate to or may have an influence on the 
points of your mission, it would be unnecessary for me to 
touch upon any of them in this letter, was it not for the 
presumption that the insurrection in the western counties of 
this State has excited much speculation, and a variety of 
opinions abroad ; and will be represented differently according to the wishes of some, and the prejudices of others, 
who may exhibit it as an evidence of what has been predicted, "that we are unable to govern ourselves." Under 
this view of the subject, I am happy in giving it to you as 
the general opinion, that this event having happened at the 
time it did was fortunate, although it will be attended with 
considerable expense. 
</p><p>
That the self-created societies which have spread themselves over this country, have been labouring incessantly to 
sow the seeds of distrust, jealousy, and of course discontent, thereby hoping to effect some revolution in the government, is not unknown to you. That they have been the 
fomenters of the western disturbances, admits of no doubt in 
the mind of any one who will examine their conduct ; but, 
fortunately, they precipitated a crisis for which they were 
not prepared ; and thereby have unfolded views which will , 
I trust, effectuate their annihilation sooner than it might 
otherwise have happened ; at the same time, that it has 
afforded an occasion for the people of this country to show 
their abhorrence of the result, and their attachment to the 
constitution and the laws : for I believe that five times the 
number of militia that was required would have come forward, if it had been necessary, in support of them. 
</p><p>
The spirit which blazed out on this occasion, as soon as 
the object was fully understood, and the lenient measures 
of the government were made known to the people, deserve to be communicated ; for there are instances of general officers going at the head of a single troop and light 
companies ; of field officers, when they came to the places 
of rendezvous and found no command for them in that 
grade, turning into the ranks and proceeding as private 
soldiers under their own captains ; and of numbers, possessing the first fortunes in the country, standing in the 
ranks as private men, and marching day by day, with their 
knapsacks and haversacks at their backs ; sleeping on 
straw with a single blanket in a soldier's tent, during the 
frosty nights we have had, by way of example to others. 
Nay, more, of many young Quakers (not discouraged by 
the elders) of the first characters, families, and properties, 
having turned into the ranks, and marching with the troops. 
</p><p>
These things have terrified the insurgents, who had no 
conception that such a spirit prevailed ; but while the thunder only rumbled at a distance, were boasting of their 
strength, and wishing for and threatening the militia by 
turns ; intimating, that the arms they should take from them 
would soon become a magazine in their hands. Their language is much changed indeed, but their principles want 
correction. 
</p><p>
I shall be more prolix, in my speech to Congress, on the 
commencement and progress of this insurrection, than is 
usual in such an instrument, or than I should have been on 
any other occasion ; but as numbers (at home and abroad) 
will hear of the insurrection, and will read the speech, that 
may know nothing of the documents to which it might refer, 
I conceived it would be better to encounter the charge of 
prolixity, by giving a cursory detail of facts (that would 
show the prominent features of the thing), than to let it go 
naked into the world, to be dressed up according to the 
fancy or inclination of the readers, or the policy of our 
enemies. 
</p><p>
I write nothing in answer to the letter of Mr. Wangenheim (enclosed by you to me). Were I to enter into correspondences of that sort (admitting there was no impropriety in the measure), I should be unable to attend to my 
ordinary duties. I have established it as a maxim, neither 
to invite nor to discourage emigrants. My opinion is, that 
they will come hither as fast as the true interest and policy 
of the United States will be benefited by foreign population. I believe many of these, as Mr. Wangenheim relates, 
have been, and I fear will continue to be, imposed upon by 
speculators in land and other things. But I know of no 
prevention but caution, nor any remedy except the laws. 
AT or is military, or other employment, so easy to obtain as 
foreigners conceive, in a country where offices and the 
seekers of them bear no proportion to each other. 
With sincere esteem and great regard, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your affectionate servant, 
</p><p>
