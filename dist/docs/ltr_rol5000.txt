SIR : I received your polite letter by the hands of Mr. Lawrence at <a href='/results.php?city=poughkeepsie' rel='city'>Poughkeepsie</a>, from whence I returned last night. 
</p><p>
I was there so engaged in the business of Court, both night and day, that I had no time to answer it, and tho' I would have 
stolen an hour for that purpose, it required a previous consultation with Mrs. Livingston. 
</p><p>
Since we heard of your intentions, solicitous for <a href="/results.php?tla=jnl" rel="met child">our daughter's</a> happiness, we have made such enquiries as have given a 
great deal of satisfaction. We both approve of your proposal and heartily wish your union may yield you all the happiness 
you seem to expect, to which we shall always be ready to contribute all in our power. Whenever it suits your convenience, 
we hope to have the pleasure of seeing you here, and in the meantime, I remain, with due respect, 
</p><p>
Y'r most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=rol" rel="me">ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON</a>.
