Hon. JOHN SHERMAN, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, D.C. 
</p><p>
Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
My division is made up mostly of new regiments, some 
of which behaved well and others badly, but I hope by 
patience to make it as good as any other division in the 
Army. 
</p><p>
Since the battle I have been up to Chickasaw, from 
which point I caused the destruction of the Charleston 
and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a> Railroad at its crossing over Bear Creek, 
a valuable piece of service. 
</p><p>
My right hand is temporarily disabled by inflammation from a wound, but with good luck will be all right 
in a week. 
</p><p>
I believe that our hardest fighting is yet to be done, 
but I have absolute faith in Generals <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a>, Buell, and 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant</a>. 
</p><p>
Affectionately your Brother, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wts" rel="me">W. T. SHERMAN</a>.
