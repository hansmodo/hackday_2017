MY DEAR OLD FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I received some time since the enclosed Letter from Dr. 
Hope ; and lately the Gold Medal it mentions was delivered 
to me for you. By the first ship directly to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
I shall send it in the Care of some safe Hand, thinking it not 
so well to hazard it with this Letter round through <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
Mr. Hope's Letter to you is not yet come to my hands. 
</p><p>
I hope the Rhubarb you have sown and distributed will be 
taken care of. There seems to me no doubt of its doing as 
well with us as in Scotland. Remember that for Use the Root 
does not come to its Perfection of Power and Virtue in less 
than Seven Years. The Physicians here, who have try'd the 
Scotch, approve it much, and say it is fully equal to the best 
imported. I send you enclosed a small Box of Upland Rice, 
brought from Cochin China. It grows there on dry Grounds, 
and not in Water like the common Sort. Also a few Seeds of 
the Chinese Tallow Tree. They have been carefully preserved 
in bringing hither by Mr. Ellis's Method. I had them from 
him, and he tells me they are in good Condition fit to vegetate. I hope they may grow under your skilful Care. My 
love to Mrs. Bartram, and all yours, from your affectionate 
Friend, B . FRANKLIN.
