MY DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I was on the Western Shore when your favor by 
Captain Lee reached my house ; and as I was daily 
expected home, General Dickinson did not forward it; 
by which means I cannot have the pleasure of seeing 
you so soon as I could wish. 
</p><p>
I always proposed spending the active part of the 
campaign in camp, but I did not conceive the enemy 
could possibly take the field till towards the 1st of 
June, owing to the difficulties of subsisting their 
horses before that time; and, therefore, I have not 
made the necessary preparation for setting off immediately, agreeably to your wishes. But, be assured, I 
shall exert myself, to the utmost, in getting some 
matters of importance to my private affairs settled ; 
after which, I shall lose no time in paying my compliments to you in camp. 
</p><p>
The wishes you kindly express, to see me engaged 
in the service, I esteem the greatest honor; but an 
appointment to any command, at this time, would probably create great complaints ; which, instead of occasioning, I wish to prevent. I have not the vanity 
to think my assistance at camp can be important to 
the service ; but, small as it may be, I conceive it my 
duty to offer it at this critical time ; reflecting, that 
if it is of no value to my country, it will cost it 
nothing. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to present my compliments to the gentlemen of your family; and believe me to be, with 
the greatest respect and esteem, your affectionate and 
most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
