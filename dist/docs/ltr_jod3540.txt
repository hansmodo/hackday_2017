MY DEAREST PORTIA, 
</p><p>
I HAVE this morning sent Mr. Thaxter with my two 
sons to Leyden, there to take up their residence for 
some time, and there to pursue their studies of Latin 
and Greek under the excellent masters, and there to 
attend lectures of the celebrated professors, in that 
university. It is much cheaper there than here. 
The air is infinitely purer, and the company and conversation are better. It is perhaps as learned a university as any in Europe. 
</p><p>
I should not wish to have children educated in the 
common schools in this country, where a littleness of 
soul is notorious. The masters are mean spirited 
wretches, pinching, kicking and boxing the children 
upon every turn. There is besides a general littleness 
arising from the incessant contemplation of stivers 
and duits, which pervades the whole people. Frugality and industry are virtues every where, but avarice and stinginess are not frugality. The Dutch say 
that without a habit of thinking of every duit before 
you spend it, no man can be a good merchant, or 
conduct trade with success. This I believe is a just 
maxim in general, but I would never wish to see a son 
of mine govern himself by it. It is the sure and certain 
way for an industrious man to be rich. It is the only 
possible way for a merchant to become the first mer 
chant or the richest man in the place. But this is an 
object that I hope none of my children will ever aim at. 
It is indeed true, every where, that those who attend 
to small expenses are always rich. 
</p><p>
I would have my children attend to duits and far 
things as devoutly as the merest Dutchman upon 
earth, if such attention was necessary to support 
their independence. A man who discovers a disposition and a design to be independent seldom succeeds. 
A jealousy arises against him. The tyrants are 
alarmed on one side lest he should oppose them. 
The slaves are alarmed on the other lest he should 
expose their servility. The cry from all quarters is, 
" He is the proudest man in the world. He cannot 
bear to be under obligation." I never in my life ob 
served any one endeavoring to lay me under particular obligations to him, but I suspected he had a de 
sign to make me his dependent, and to have claims 
upon my gratitude. This I should have no objection 
to, because gratitude is always in one's power. But 
the danger is, that men will expect and require more 
of us than honor and innocence and rectitude will 
permit us to perform. 
</p><p>
In our country, however, any man, with common 
industry and prudence, may be independent. But to 
put an end to this stuff, 
</p><p>
Adieu most affectionately adieu.
