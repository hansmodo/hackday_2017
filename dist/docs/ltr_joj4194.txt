Accept, my good friend, my thanks for your kind letter 
of the 22d ult., and for the pamphlets enclosed with it. 
They came to my hands on the 2d inst. The state of my 
health is such, that I can read or write but little at a time 
without fatigue ; and, therefore, I cannot prudently venture 
on the task you recommend. 
</p><p>
Whether war of every description is prohibited by the 
gospel, is one of those questions on which the excitement of 
any of the passions can produce no light. An answer to it 
can result only from careful investigation and fair reasoning. 
</p><p>
It appears to me that the gospel not only recognises the 
whole moral law, and extends and perfects our knowledge 
of it, but also enjoins on all mankind the observance of it. 
Being ordained by a legislator of infinite wisdom and rectitude, and in whom there is "no variableness," it must be 
free from imperfection, and therefore never has, nor ever 
will require amendment or alteration. Hence I conclude, 
that the moral law is exactly the same now that it w 7 as before the flood. 
</p><p>
That all those wars and fightings are unlawful, which 
proceed from culpable desires and designs (or in Scripture 
language from lusts), on the one side or on the other, is too 
clear to require proof. As to wars of an opposite description, and many such there have been, I believe they are as 
lawful to the unoffending party in our days, as they were 
in the days of Abraham. He waged war against and 
defeated the five kings. He piously dedica ted a tenth of the 
spoils ; and, instead of being blamed, was blessed. 
</p><p>
What should we think of a human legislator who should 
authorize or encourage infractions of his own laws? If 
wars of every kind and description are prohibited by the 
moral law, I see no way of reconciling such a prohibition with those parts of Scripture which record institutions, declarations, and interpositions of the Almighty which 
manifestly evince the contrary ? If every war is sinful, how 
did it happen that the sin of waging any war is not specified 
among the numerous sins and offences which are mentioned 
and reproved in both the Testaments? 
</p><p>
To collect and arrange the many facts and arguments 
which relate to this subject, would require more time and 
application than I am able to bestow. The aforegoing are 
hinted merely to exhibit some of the reasons on which my 
opinion rests. 
</p><p>
It certainly is very desirable that a pacific disposition 
should prevail among all nations. The most effectual way 
of producing it, is by extending the prevalence and influence 
of the gospel. Real Christians will abstain from violating 
the rights of others, and therefore will not provoke war. 
</p><p>
Almost all nations have peace or war at the will and 
pleasure of rulers whom they do not elect, and who are not 
always wise or virtuous. <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> has given to our 
people the choice of their rulers, and it is the duty, as well 
as the privilege and interest, of our Christian nation to select 
and prefer Christians for their rulers. 
</p><p>
The sentiment expressed in the extract from your 
brothers letter, corresponds with his benevolent disposition. 
He has been " diligent in well-doing," and his works will 
not cease to receive, as well as deserve commendation. 
When you write to him, assure him of my esteem and 
regard. 
</p><p>
I thank you for the kind wishes expressed in the conclusion of your letter. They refer to topics on which I have 
been accustomed to meditate, and are far more important 
than any which belong to this transient scene. 
</p><p>
With the best wishes for your welfare, in the most 
enlarged sense, 
</p><p>
I remain, your obliged friend, 
</p><p>
