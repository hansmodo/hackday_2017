Instructions. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
You are to take the command of all the troops remaining in this department, consisting of the two regiments of New Hampshire, ten of Massachusetts, and 
five of Connecticut infantry, the corps of invalids, Sheldon's legion, the third regiment of artillery, together with all such State troops and militia, as are retained in service, and who would have been under my own command. 
</p><p>
The security of <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a> and the posts in the Highlands is to be considered the first object of your attention. In order to effect this, you will make such dispositions as in your judgement the circumstances shall 
from time to time require ; taking care to have as large a supply of salted provisions as possible constantly on hand ; to have the fortifications, works, and magazines 
repaired and perfected as far as may be ; to have the garrison at least in all cases kept up to its present strength ; and to have the minuter arrangements and plans for the defence and support of this important post 
perfectly understood and vigorously acted upon, in case of any attempt against it. Ample magazines of wood and forage are to be laid in against the approaching winter. The former should be cut on the margin of 
the river, and transported by water to the garrison. The latter ought to be collected from the country below the lines, in the greatest quantities possible, and 
deposited in such places as you shall judge proper. 
</p><p>
The force now put under your orders, it is presumed, 
will be sufficient for all the purposes above mentioned ; 
as well as to yield a very considerable protection and 
cover to the country, without hazarding the safety of 
the posts in the Highlands. This is to be esteemed, 
as it respects the friendly inhabitants and resources of 
the country, an extremely interesting object ; but, when 
compared with the former, of a secondary nature. The 
protection of the northern and western frontiers of the 
State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as well as those parts of that and 
other States most contiguous and exposed to the ravages and depredations of the enemy, will claim your 
attention. But, as the contingencies, which are to be 
expected in the course of the campaign, may be so 
various, unforeseen, and almost infinite, that no particular line of conduct can be prescribed for them, upon 
all such occasions you will be governed by your own 
prudence and discretion, in which the fullest confidence 
is placed. 
</p><p>
Although your general rule of conduct will be to act 
on the defensive only, yet it is not meant to prohibit 
you from striking a blow at the enemy's posts, or detachments, should a fair opportunity present itself. 
</p><p>
The most eligible position for your army, in my opinion, will be on the north side of Croton River ; as 
well for the purpose of supporting the garrison of West 
Point, annoying the enemy, and covering the country, 
as for the security and repose of your troops, Waterbury's brigade, which may be posted towards the 
Sound, Sheldon's corps, the State troops of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
and other light parties, may occasionally be made use 
of to hold the enemy in check, and carry on a petite 
guerre with them ; but I would recommend keeping 
your force as much collected and as compact as the 
nature of the service will admit, doing duty by corps 
instead of detachments whenever it is practicable, and 
above all exerting yourself most strenuously and assiduously, while the troops are in a camp of repose, to 
make them perfect in their exercise and manoeuvres, 
and to establish the most regular system of discipline 
and duty. The good of the service and the emulation 
of corps will, I am persuaded, prompt the officers and 
men to devote their whole time and attention to the 
pleasing and honorable task of becoming masters of 
their profession. The uncertainty, which the present 
movements of the army will probably occasion with the 
enemy, ought to be increased by every means in your 
power, and the deception kept up as long as possible. 
</p><p>
It will not be expedient to prevent such militia as were ordered from coming in, until the arrival of the Count de Grasse, or something definite or certain is 
known from the southward ; and even then (but of this you will be advised) circumstances may render it 
advisable to keep the enemy at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> in check, to prevent their detaching to reinforce their southern army, or to harass the inhabitants on the seacoast. 
</p><p>
The redoubt on the east side of Dobbs's Ferry is to be dismantled and demolished, and the platforms to be 
taken up and transported up the river, if it can conveniently be done. The blockhouse on the other side is to be maintained, or evacuated and destroyed, as you 
shall think proper. The water-guards and other precautions to prevent a surprise, you will be pleased to take into consideration, and regulate in such a manner 
as you shall judge most expedient. You will be pleased, also, to keep me regularly advised of every important event, which shall take place in your department. 
Given under my hand at Head-Quarters, this <a rel='day origin' value='19'>19th</a> day 
of <a rel="month origin" value="8">August</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1781' rel="origin">1781</a>.
