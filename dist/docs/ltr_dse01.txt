I am Jim's younger brother. My very first memory is of him, and strong emotion experienced
in his support.<br><br>
There are many other memories. He bought me my first bicycle. Much later, I was his best man
- and he was mine.<br><br>
But, looking back over more than fifty years, the patterns stand out more than their pieces. In
our home, for example, Jim was taught that you stand on your own feet, and that you stand behind your word.<br><br>
He lived by these precepts. Equally important, he passed these values on to his children.<br><br>
One often hears the adage, "You can't take it with you." We all know it isn't really true. There are 
many exceptions.<br><br>
Of the things my brother takes with him I will mention only three: friendship, respect, love.<br><br><br>

To the best of my recollection, this is what I said at the memorial services - less than 150 words.
It was politely received but, judging from comments afterward, made no particular impression
on anyone but Gail.
