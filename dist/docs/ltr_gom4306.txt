My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yours of the 21st of June, is at length safely arrived. Poor <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='met colleague'>Lafayette</a> ! Your letter for him must remain with me some time. His enemies here are as 
virulent as ever, and I can give you no better proof than this. Among the King's papers was found nothing of what his enemies wished and expected, except his correspondence with M. de Lafayette, which 
breathes, from beginning to end, the purest sentiments of freedom. It is therefore kept secret, while he 
stands accused of designs, in conjunction with the dethroned monarch, to enslave his country. 
</p><p>
The foot, respecting this correspondence, is communicated to me by a person to whom it was related confidentially by one of the parties who examined it. 
You will have seen, in my letters to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='met colleague co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, a 
proposition made by Mr. Short respecting M. de Lafayette, with my reply. I had very good reason to 
apprehend that our interference, at that time, would have been injurious to him; hut I hope that a moment will soon offer, in which something may be 
done for his relief. In reading my correspondence 
with Mr. Short, you must consider that I wrote to 
the French and Austrian Government, as each would 
take the liberty to read my letters. 
</p><p>
You will have seen, also, that, in my letters to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='met colleague co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, I hint at the dangers attending a residence 
in this city. Some of the sanguinary events which 
have taken place, and which were partial executions 
of great plans, will point to a natural interpretation 
thereof; but these were not what I contemplated. 
Should we ever meet, I will entertain you with the 
recital of many things which it would be improper 
to commit to paper, at least for the present. You 
will have seen that the King is accused of high 
crimes and misdemeanours ; but I verily believe that 
he wished sincerely for this nation the enjoyment of 
the utmost degree of liberty which their situation 
and circumstances will permit. He wished for a good 
Constitution ; but, unfortunately, he had not the means 
to obtain it, or, if he had, he was thwarted by those 
about him. What may be his Me, God only knows; 
but history informs us, that the passage of dethroned 
monarchs is short from the prison to the grave. 
</p><p>
I have mentioned to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='met colleague co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, repeatedly, my 
wish to have positive instructions and orders for my 
government. I need not tell you. Sir, how agreeable 
this would be to me, and what a load it would take 
from my mind. At the same time, I am fully sensible 
that it may be inconvenient to give me such orders. 
The United States may wish to temporize, and see 
how things are likely to end ; and in such case, leaving me at large, with the right reserved to avow or 
disavow me according to circumstances and events, is 
for the Government an eligible position. My part in 
the play, is not quite so eligible ; but, although I wish 
the Senate to be sensible of this, I am far from wishing that any precipitate step be taken to relieve me 
from it, for I know how contemptible is every private consideration, when compared with the public 
interests. One step, however, seems natural; namely, 
to say that, before any new letters of credence are 
given, it will be proper to know to whom they are 
to be directed, because the Convention, a mere temporary body, is to be succeeded by some fixed form, 
and it may be a long time before any such form 
will be adopted. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='met colleague co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, from the materials in his possession, 
will be able to give you an accurate account of the 
military events. I discover three capital errors in 
the conduct of the Duke of Brunswick. First, his 
proclamation arrogated rights, which, on no construction, could belong to him or his employers, and contained threats which no circumstances could warrant, 
and which, in no supposable success, could be executed. They tended, however, to unite the nation in 
opposing him, seeing that no hope remained for those 
who had taken any part in the revolution ; and the 
conduct observed towards Monsieur de Lafayette and 
his companions, was a severe comment on the cruelty 
of the rest. Thus, in the same moment, he wounded 
the pride, insulted the feelings, and alarmed the fears 
of all France. And, by his thundering menaces to 
protect the royal family, he plunged them into the 
situation from which he meant to extricate them. 
</p><p>
The second error was, not to dash at Paris the instant he received the news of the affair of the tenth. 
He should then have advanced at all hazards, and if, 
in so doing, he had declared to the several Generals 
and armies, that he expected their assistance to restore their dethroned Prince and violated Constitution, I am persuaded that he would have met with as 
much support as opposition. I learn, within these two 
days, that the Delegates of Lorraine and Alsace had 
so little hope, or rather were so thoroughly persuaded 
that those Provinces would join the enemy, that they 
made unusual haste to come forward, lest they should 
be apprehended. Great activity, in that moment, 
would have done wonders ; but then he was not 
ready. 
</p><p>
The third great error was, that, after waiting so 
long, he came forward at all, this season. By menacing the frontiers with great and increasing force, vast 
numbers of the militia would have been drawn to the 
utmost verge of the French territory. The difficulty 
of subsisting them there would have been extreme. 
By taking strong and good positions, his troops would 
have been preserved in full vigor, and the French, 
wasted by disease, tired of inaction, and stimulated 
by their natural impatience and impetuosity of temper, would have forced their Generals to attack, even 
if they had the prudence to be quiet. The consequence of such attack, excepting always the will of 
God, must have been a complete victory on his part, 
and then it would have been next to impossible for 
them to escape. Then the towns would have surrendered, believing the business to be over, and he might 
have come as far forward this autumn as the needful 
transportation of stores would permit. Next spring 
France would have found it almost impossible to subsist the armies needful for the defence in that part 
of the country which is most defensible, and, of consequence, her enemy would have reached the point 
from which lie lately retreated, without the smallest difficulty. 
</p><p>
The appearances are so vague and contradictory, 
that I cannot pretend to tell you whether the alliance will or will not be preserved for the next campaign. If I were to hazard conjectures on the present state of things, it might cast suspicions where I 
have not sufficient ground, and therefore I will bury 
them in my own bosom, lest accident should put this 
letter into improper hands. France has a strong ally 
in the feelings of those nations who are subject to 
despotism ; but, for that very reason, she has a mortal 
enemy in every Prince. If, as is very possible, the 
league should hold firm till next spring, it will then 
have gained considerable auxiliaries, and I am very 
much mistaken if this nation will make as great efforts as those she is now making. The character of 
nations must be taken into consideration in all political questions, and that of France has ever been an 
enthusiastic inconstancy. They soon get tired of a 
thing. They adopt without examination, and reject 
without sufficient cause. They are now agog with 
their republic, and may perhaps adopt some form of 
Government with a huzza ; but that they will adopt 
a good form, or, having adopted, adhere to it, is what 
I do not believe. There is a great body of Royalists 
in the country, who do not now declare themselves, 
because it would be certain death ; but a favorable 
occasion would bring them out of their holes. 
</p><p>
The Mictions here are violent, and among those who 
administer the Government there is not, I am told, 
that degree of character which lays hold of the esteem and respect of mankind, but rather the contrary. 
In their opponents, there is a nervous temper, which 
sticks at nothing; and, if I see rightly, there is in 
the current of their affairs, a strong eddy or counter 
tide, which may change materially both men and tidings. Yet let what will happen, I think it hardly 
possible that they should blunder as much as the 
emigrants ; and I am prone to believe that, in war 
and politics, the folly of our adversaries constitutes 
our greatest force. The future prospect, therefore, is 
involved in mist and darkness. 
</p><p>
There is but one sovereign in Europe, the Empress 
of Russia, who is not, in the scale of talents, considerably below par. The Emperor, who, it is said, is consumptive and cannot live long, is now much influenced 
by Manfredi, a statesman of the Italian school, who 
takes insincerity for wisdom. The Prussian Cabinet 
is far from strong. Leuchesini, an able man, is said 
to be rising in influence there ; but there is such a 
mixture of lust and folly in the Chief, that no one 
man can keep things steady. The alliance with Vienna is disagreeable to the Prussians, and particularly 
to the inhabitants of Berlin, which may have some 
influence in destroying it ; and his Majesty has given 
three strong proofs, since his accession, that he is by 
no means nice on the subject of public faith. The 
invasion of Brabant will, I am persuaded, alarm both 
Britain and Holland; but whether they wUl confine 
themselves to court intrigue, or come into the field, 
is doubtful. 
</p><p>
Thus you will perceive, Sir, that nothing can be 
predicted, with tolerable certainty, respecting the affairs of this country, either internal or external, at 
the present moment. I am, &c., 
</p><p>
