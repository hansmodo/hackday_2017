MY DEAR SIR, My last was of the 27 May. It enclosed, 
among other things, a letter to the French Minister de Flnterieure, in answer to one enclosing a Decree of the National 
Assembly. On the propriety of the answer I wished your 
freest judgment; and as the sending one at all may be rendered 
by events improper, I must request the favor of you not to forward the letter if intelligence should confirm such to be the 
state of things that it would be totally mal-apropos there. 
Provided it be proper there, and consequently proper in itself, 
I shall not trouble myself about any comments which the publication attending all such things may produce here. The letter 
preceding my last, as well as the last, contained some other 
papers which I wish to know have been received.

Your two last favors were of May 27 and June 2. The 
latter confirms the apostasy of Dumouriez, but relieves us from 
the more alarming account of his being supported in it by the 
army. Still, however, much is to be dreaded from the general 
posture of things. Should they take a turn decidedly wrong, I 
fear little regard will be paid to the limited object avowed by 
the Austrian general in his first proclamation. In fact, if the 
plan of Dumouriez had succeeded, it is probable that, under the 
clause of the proclamation relating to an amendment of imperfections in the Constitution of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1791">1791</a>, the form of the national 
sanction would have been obtained, as in the Restoration of 
Charles II, to whatever establishment military despotism might 
please to dictate. The only hope of France, next to the success 
of her own efforts, seems to lie in the number and discordant 
views of her combined enemies.

I observ.that the newspapers continue to criticise the President's proclamation, and I find that some of the criticisms 
excite the attention of dispassionate and judicious individuals 
here. I have heard it remarked by such, with some surprise, 
that the President should have declared the United States to 
be neutral in the unqualified terms used, when we were so 
notoriously and unequivocally under eventual engagements to 
defend the American possessions of France. I have heard it 
remarked, also, that the impartiality enjoined on the people was 
as little reconcileable with their moral obligations as the unconditional neutrality proclaimed by the Government is with 
the express articles of the Treaty. It has been asked, also, 
whether the authority of the Executive extended by any part 
of the Constitution to a declaration of the Disposition of the 
United States on the subject of war and peace ? I have been 
mortified that on these points I could offer no bona fide explanations that ought to be satisfactory. On the last point, I must 
own my surprise that such a prerogative should have been exercised. Perhaps I may have not attended to some parts of the 
Constitution with sufficient care, or may have misapprehended 
its meaning. But, as I have always supposed and still conceive, 
a proclamation on the subject could not properly go beyond a 
declaration of the fact that the United States were at war or 
peace, and an injunction of a suitable conduct on the citizens. 
The right to decide the question whether the duty and interest of the United States require war or peace under any 
given circumstances, and whether their disposition be towards 
the one or the other, seems to be essentially and exclusively 
involved in the right vested in the Legislature of declaring 
war in time of peace, and in the President and Senate of 
making peace in time of war. Did no such view of the subject 
present itself in the discussions of the Cabinet? I am extremely afraid that the President may not be sufficiently aware 
of the snares that may be laid for his good intentions by men 
whose politics at bottom are very different from his own. An 
assumption of prerogatives not clearly found in the Constitution, and having the appearance of being copied from a monarchical model, will beget animadversion equally mortifying to 
him and disadvantageous to the Government. Whilst animadversions of this sort can be plausibly ascribed to the spirit of 
party, the force of them may not be felt. But all his real 
friends will be anxious that his public conduct may bear the 
strictest scrutiny of future times, as well as of the present day; 
and all such friends of the Constitution would be doubly pained 
at infractions of it under auspices that may consecrate the evil 
till it be incurable.

The great danger of misconstruing the sentiment of Virginia 
with regard to liberty and France is from the heretical tone of 
conversation in the Towns on the post roads. The voice of the 
country is universally and warmly right. If the popular disposition could be collected and carried into effect, a most important use might be made of it in obtaining contributions of 
the necessaries called for by the danger of famine in France. 
Unfortunately, the disaffection of the Towns, which alone could 
give effect to a plan for the purpose, locks up the public gratitude and beneficence.

Our fine prospects in the wheat fields have been severely 
injured by the weather for some time past. A warm and moist 
spring had pushed the wheat into rather a luxuriant state. It 
had got safe into the head, however, and with tolerable weather 
would have ripened into a most exuberant crop. Just as the 
grain was in a milky state the weather became wetter than 
ever, and has continued raining or cloudy almost constantly 
since. This has brought on a little of the rust, and pretty 
universally in this quarter a decay of the ear called the Rot. 
Should the weather be ever so favorable henceforward, a considerable proportion will be lost; and if unfavorable, the loss 
may be almost entire. We are at this moment both excessively 
wet and hot. The forwardest wheat is turning fast, and may 
be nearly safe. The generality is not sufficiently advanced to 
be out of danger of future, or beyond the effect of past causes. 
The Kentucky coffee trees hi this neighborhood are too 
young to bear for some years. I will do all I can to get the 
seed for Bartram from Kentucky as soon as possible.

Adieu.
