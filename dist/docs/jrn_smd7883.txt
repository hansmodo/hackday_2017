I have been so busy making Lieutenant Bourge's 
shirt that I have not had time to write, besides having very little to write about. So my industry saved 
my paper and spared these pages a vast amount of 
trash. I would not let any one touch Lieutenant Bourge's shirt except myself ; and last evening, 
when I held it up completed, the loud praises it 
received satisfied me it would answer. Miriam and 
Miss Ripley declared it the prettiest ever made. It 
is dark purple merino. The bosom I tucked with 
pleats a quarter of an inch deep, all the way up to 
the collar, and stitched a narrow crimson silk braid 
up the centre to hold it in its place. Around the 
collar, cuffs, pockets, and band down the front, the 
red cord runs, forming a charming contrast to the 
dark foundation. Indeed, I devoted the sole article 
the Yankees let fall from my two workboxes a 
bunch of soutache to the work. Large white 
pearl buttons completed the description, and my 
shirt is really as quiet, subdued, and pretty a one as 
I ever saw. I should first hear the opinion of the 
owner, though. If he does not agree with all the 
others, I shall say he has no taste.

I got a long sweet letter from Sophie on Friday that made me happy for the whole day. They were 
about leaving for <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a>. I was glad to hear 
they would be out of danger, but still I was sorry they were going so far away. I have been laying a 
hundred wild schemes to reach <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> and 
spend a day or two with them, which is impossible now. Sophie writes just as she talks and that 
means remarkably well, so I can at least have the pleasure of corresponding. At Dr. Carnal's they 
will be out of the reach of all harm and danger; so I ought to rejoice. There is one thing in which Sophie and I agree, and that is in making <a href='/results.php?tla=tjj' rel=''>Stonewall Jackson</a> our hero. Talk of  <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel=''>Beauregard</a>! he never had my adoration; but <a href='/results.php?tla=tjj' rel=''>Stonewall</a> is the greatest man of the age, decidedly.

Still no authentic reports of the late battles in 
Virginia. I say late, referring to those fought two 
weeks ago. From the Federal accounts, glowing as 
they usually are, I should gather the idea that their 
rout was complete. I cannot imagine why we can 
hear nothing more from our own side. . . . 
I think my first act on my return home will be to 
take a cup of coffee and a piece of bread, two luxuries 
of which I have been deprived for a long while. 
Miriam vows to devour an unheard-of number of 
biscuits, too. How many articles we considered as 
absolutely necessary, before, have we now been 
obliged to dispense with! Nine months of the year 
I reveled in ice, thought it impossible to drink water 
without it. Since last November, I have tasted it 
but once, and that once by accident. And oh, yes! 
I caught some hail-stones one day at <a href='/results.php?city=linwood' rel='city'>Linwood</a> ! Ice 
cream, lemonade, and sponge cake was my chief 
diet; it was a year last July since I tasted the two 
first, and one since I have seen the last. Bread I 
believed necessary to life; vegetables, senseless. The 
former I never see, and I have been forced into cultivating at least a toleration of the latter. Snap beans 
I can actually swallow, sweet potatoes I really like, 
and one day at Dr. Nolan's I " bolted" a mouthful 
of tomatoes, and afterwards kept my seat with the 
heroism of a martyr. These are the minor trials of 
war. If that were all if coarse, distasteful food 
were the only inconvenience!

When I think of what Lavinia must suffer so far 
from us, and in such ignorance of our condition, our 
trials seem nothing in comparison to hers. And 
think how uneasy Brother must be, hearing of the 
battle, and not knowing where we fled to! For he 
has not heard of us for almost two months. In return 
we are uneasy about him and Sister. If <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> 
is attacked, what will become of them with all those 
children?
