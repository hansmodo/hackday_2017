EVERYTHING here is in as good a way as I could wish, considering the temper and designs of Administration. 
I assure you, the letters have had no such bad effects as the Tories intended, and as some of our short 
sighted Whigs apprehended ; so far otherwise, that I see and hear, every day, fresh proofs that everybody 
is coming fast into every political sentiment contained in them. I assure you L could mention compliments passed upon them, and if a serious decision 
could be had upon them, the public voice would be found in their favor.

But I am distressed with cares of another kind. Your two letters are never out of my thoughts. I should have mounted my horse, this day, for Braintree, 
if I had not hopes of hearing further from you in a day or two. However, I will hope that your prospects are more agreeable than they were, and that the 
children are all better, as well as the rest of the family, and the neighbours. If I should hear more disagreeable advices from you, I shall certainly come 
home, for I cannot leave you in such affliction without endeavouring to lessen it, unless there was an absolute 
necessity of my staying here to do a duty to the public, which I think there is not 
</p><p>
I must beg to be excused, my dear, from hinting at anything for the future, of public persons or things. Secrecy is so much exacted. But thus much I may say, that I never saw so serious and determined a 
spirit. I must also beseech you to be cautious what you write to me and by whom you send. Letters sent to the care of Colonel Warren will come safe. 
My. regards, with all proper distinctions, to my relations and yours, my friends and yours, my acquaintances and yours.

This will go by Major Bayard, a gentleman of the Presbyterian persuasion in this city, of excellent character, to whom I am indebted for a great many civilities.
