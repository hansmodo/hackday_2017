The mail arrived today. A large crowd of anxious expectants was in attendance. When the letters were ready for distribution, a huge fellow stepped up. A beard that almost covered his face and a large, heavy revolver sticking in his belt gave him the appearance of a ruffian without a tender spot in his composition. Upon giving his name, a handsomely enveloped letter was handed him. After weighing out his two dollars for it, he stepped aside, broke open the seal and commenced reading it. In a few minutes I looked
around again and saw this same burly, stern-looking man, who looked as hard as adamant, in tears. He had heard from loved ones at home and memory carried him back to happier scenes.

I observed another person in this same crowd, a pale, youthful man. He asked for a letter and was told that none had come for him. It was painful then to witness that young man raise his voice in blasphemy and swear his friends had forgotten him and cared nothing about him. He called up his companions to the bar and they all enjoyed a drunken revel.

This morning the ground was covered with snow to the depth of three inches. But snow doesn't remain in this part of California; it goes quicker than it comes. Though the tops of the highest mountains are often covered with snow several feet deep, in the valleys it scarcely ever covers the ground. Yesterday was warm and pleasant, with a bright sun all day, like April.

A few weeks ago Dr. Gunn's wife, an accomplished lady, and four children, ranging from four to ten years, two boys (Douglas and Chester) and two sweet little girls, arrived from Philadelphia. They came around Cape Horn in a clipper ship. Everything now goes on quite comfortably. A woman about a house produces a new order of things.
