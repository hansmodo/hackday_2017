My good Friend, 
</p><p>
I thank you for informing me by your letter of the 15th 
inst. that you had received " an heritage and gift," which 
doubtless filled your heart with joy and gratitude. 
</p><p>
It would give me pleasure to present in person to you 
and Mrs. Morris my gratulations on the occasion ; but since 
the winter began, I have not been abroad, and this confinement will, as usual, continue until warm weather. I hope 
Mrs. Morris and the " spes altera" are doing well, and that 
the emotions they excite are not interrupted by gout or 
anxiety. 
</p><p>
You request me to be one of the godfathers. Baptism 
is too generally regarded as being little more than a customary ceremony ; and yet the purpose of it, and the names 
used on the occasion, show it to be a solemn procedure. 
It confers privileges, and imposes obligations of the highest class. Whoever consents to be employed as a shepherd, 
should recollect, that if a lamb be lost by his negligence, he 
must answer for it to the owner of the flock. Sponsors, 
however, not unfrequently become such, with as little sense 
of personal responsibility, as actors on the stage make the 
engagements, &c, allotted to their parts. 
</p><p>
Had I the prospect of residing here many years, I should 
feel no reluctance, for I should find in my heart and mind 
sufficient inducements to fulfil the duties in question, in case 
they should eventually be incumbent on me. But as I expect to remove, at a more early period, to a distant country, 
where I shall not be in a capacity to attend to persons or 
things here, it appears to me advisable that some proper 
person not so circumstanced should be selected. 
</p><p>
It is an agreeable circumstance that you will probably, 
continue at Morrisania for many years, and have time and 
health to prepare the young gentleman to make a figure 
there, as w T ell as at the more valuable habitation and 
estate, which will, in his baptism, be offered to him by his 
Sovereign. 
</p><p>
That you and he may, here and ever, be happy in and 
with each other, is the fervent wish of 
</p><p>
Your friend, 
</p><p>
