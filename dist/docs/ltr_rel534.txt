My Precious Little Agnes:  I have not heard of you for a long time.
I wish you were with me, for always solitary, I am sometimes weary,
and long for the reunion of my family once again.  But I will not
speak of myself, but of you....  I have seen the ladies in this vicinity
only when flying from the enemy, and it caused me acute grief to
witness their exposure and suffering.  But a more noble spirit was
never displayed anywhere.  The faces of old and young were wreathed
with smiles, and glowed with happiness at their sacrifices for the good
of their country.  Many have lost EVERYTHING.  What the fire and shells
of the enemy spared, their pillagers destroyed.  But God will shelter
them, I know.  So much heroism will not be unregarded.  I can only
hold oral communication with your sister [His daughter Mary, in King
George county, within the lines of the enemy], and have forbidden the
scouts to bring any writing, and have taken some back that I had
given them for her.  If caught, it would compromise them.  They only
convey messages.  I learn in that way she is well.
</p><p>
                   Your devoted father,
