Rio GRANDE, OPPOSITE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a>, 
March 29, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1846">1846</a>. 
</p><p>
On the twenty-sixth we advanced our camp three 
miles where we awaited <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> s return. He 
arrived on the evening of the twenty-seventh and on 
the twenty-eighth we moved off in our usual order 
but soon came into defiles through dense chaparral 
compelling us to march in single column. About 
half-past nine in the morning, we saw the first habitation since leaving <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Corpus Christi" rel="city">Corpus Christi</a>, and were soon 
marching between cultivated fields enclosed in high 
hedges cutting off all view of the country, save the 
thatched roofs of the cottages. At half -past ten we 
were marching upon the bank of the Rio Grande immediately in front and in full view of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a>, 
our colors flying and music playing. The Mexican 
flag was waving from various points over the city, 
sentinels posted on the opposite bank and a few men 
and women walking about carelessly. Most of the 
inhabitants have left this side, and all communication 
is cut off as they have taken all the boats over to their 
side. The authorities appeared very sulky neither 
fighting nor shaking hands. The river is a rapid 
stream two hundred yards wide, deep, and enclosed 
with perpendicular banks about twenty feet in height. 
After our camp was pitched I wandered down the 
bank among many others gazing at the fortifications 
and troops of the Mexicans. Their cavalry and in 
fantry were moving about establishing pickets and 
guards in various directions along the bank.

General Worth and staff, after much difficulty, 
induced them to send over a boat to receive him with 
a flag. He crossed to their shore but General Mejia 
(pronounced Mahea) refused to receive any one but 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a>. General Vegas, however, finally 
came to the shore and told General Worth, in amount, 
that they considered war begun by our invasion and 
they could hold no intercourse with us.

In the afternoon, the habits of these people were 
curiously displayed. Young women came down to 
the river side, disrobed without any hesitation, and 
plunged into the stream, regardless of the numerous 
spectators on either bank. Some of our young officers 
were in the water opposite them and soon swam 
towards them. The Mexican guards were not, how 
ever, disposed to let them come much nearer than the 
middle of the river, so they returned after kissing 
their hands to the tawny damsels which was laugh 
ingly returned.

This morning we found the enemy had been busy 
during the night erecting breastworks and planting 
cannon opposite to us. What will be the result of all 
this I can only conjecture. We certainly ought not 
with so small a force be left here to face the whole 
Mexican nation. General Ampudia with more than 
three thousand veterans will, it is said, in a few days 
reach <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a>. This is a sort of journal written 
under all sorts of disadvantages from time to time 
when I have been tired and weary. Many incidents 
of interest have been passed over, they will be subjects of conversation for us at some future day. . . .
