<a rel='month origin' value='8'>August</a> <a rel='day origin' value='25'>25th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. Mr. Barnwell says democracies lead to untruthfulness. To be always electioneering is to be al 
ways false; so both we and the Yankees are unreliable as regards our own exploits. " How about empires? Were 
there ever more stupendous lies than the Emperor Napoleon s? " Mr. Barnwell went on: " People dare not tell 
the truth in a canvass ; they must conciliate their constituents. Now everybody in a democracy always wants an 
office; at least, everybody in Richmond just now seems to want one." Never heeding interruptions, he went on: 
" As a nation, the English are the most truthful in the world. " " And so are our country gentlemen : they own 
their constituents at least, in some of the parishes, where 
there are few whites; only immense estates peopled by negroes/ Thackeray speaks of the lies that were told 
on both sides in the British wars with France; England kept quite alongside of her rival in that fine art. England 
lied then as fluently as Russell lies about us now.

Went to see Agnes De Leon, my Columbia school friend. She is fresh from Egypt, and I wished to hear of the Nile, 
the crocodiles, the mummies, the Sphinx, and the Pyramids. But her head ran upon Washington life, such as we knew 
it, and her soul was here. No theme was possible but a discussion of the latest war news.

Mr. Clayton, Assistant Secretary of State, says we spend two millions a week. Where is all that money to 
come from? They don't want us to plant cotton, but to make provisions. Now, cotton always means money, or did 
when there was an outlet for it and anybody to buy it. Where is money to come from now ?

Mr. Barnwell's new joke, I dare say, is a Joe Miller, but Mr. Barnwell laughed in telling it till he cried. A man 
was fined for contempt of court and then, his case coming on, the Judge talked such arrant nonsense and was so 
warped in his mind against the poor man, that the " fined 
one " walked up and handed the august Judge a five-dollar bill. " Why? What is that for? " said the Judge. " Oh, 
I feel such a contempt of this court coming on again !

I came up tired to death; took down my hair; had it hanging over me in a Crazy Jane fashion; and sat still, 
hands over my head (half undressed, but too lazy and sleepy to move). I was sitting in a rocking-chair by an 
open window taking my ease and the cool night air, when suddenly the door opened and Captain walked in.

He was in the middle of the room before he saw his mistake ; he stared and was transfixed, as the novels say. I dare say 
I looked an ancient Gorgon. Then, with a more frantic glare, he turned and fled without a word. I got up and 
bolted the door after him, and then looked in the glass and laughed myself into hysterics. I shall never forget to lock 
the door again. But it does not matter in this case. I looked totally unlike the person bearing my name, who, 
covered with lace cap, etc., frequents the drawing-room. I doubt if he would know me again.
