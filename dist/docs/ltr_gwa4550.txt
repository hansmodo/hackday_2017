Sir, 
</p><p>
It being important to both countries, that the treaty of 
peace between Great Britain and the United States should be 
observed and performed with perfect and mutual good faith, 
and that a treaty of commerce should be concluded by them, 
on principles of reciprocal advantage to both, I wish to be ascertained of the sentiments and intentions of the Court of London on these interesting subjects. 
</p><p>
It appears to me most expedient to have these inquiries 
made informally, by a private agent ; and understanding that 
you will soon be in London, I desire you in that capacity, and 
on the authority and credit of this letter, to converse with his 
Britannic Majesty s Ministers on these points, viz. whether 
there be any and what objections to performing those articles in 
the treaty, which remain to be performed on his part ; and 
whether they incline to a treaty of commerce with the United 
States on any and what terms ? 
</p><p>
This communication ought regularly to be made to you by 
the secretary of state, but that office not being at present filled , 
my desire of avoiding delays induces me to make it under my 
own hand. It is my wish to promote harmony and mutual satisfaction between the two countries ; and it would give me great 
pleasure to find that the result of your agency, in the business 
now committed to you, will conduce to that end. 
</p><p>
I am, Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
