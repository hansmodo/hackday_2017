MY DEAR MR. CRAMER:
</p><p>
Since leaving Copenhagen Mrs. Grant and I have visited every capital in
Europe not previously visited by us.
</p><p>
I can say with great earnestness that no part of our journeyings gave
us more pleasure than that through the Scandinavian countries, and no
public have impressed me more favorably. If I were going to remain over
another year I should go back to Norway at least and far enough north
to see the midnight sun. But we expect to leave Paris about the middle
of January, to return to the States by the way of India, China, and
Japan. The Secretary of the Navy has been kind enough to invite us to
go on a man-of-war which leaves the United States to-day for the
Chinese squadron, via the Mediterranean and Suez. I first declined but
since cabled my acceptance. This will probably bring us around home
about next October or November.
</p><p>
I am sorry to say that I do not get favorable news from Orvil. He does
not seem to improve.
</p><p>
Julia joins me in love to Mary and the children and in kindest regards
to yourself.
</p><p>
I hope you did not forward the stones presented by the Consul.--Julia
says to tell Mary that she got a very rich fur cloak in Paris and hopes
she got one also. Is there anything we can do for you in Paris?
</p><p>
Very truly yours,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.
