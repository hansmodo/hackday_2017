SIR, 
</p><p>
Upon my arrival in this department, I found the main body of the army encamped at Van Schaiek's Islands, which are made by the sprouts of the Mohawk River joining with Hudson's River, nine miles 
north of <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. A brigade, under General Poor, 
encamped at London's Ferry, on the south bank of the Mohawk River, five miles from hence, A brigade, 
under <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel=''>General Lincoln</a>, had joined General Stark at Bennington; and a brigade, under <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel=''>General Arnold</a>, 
marched the 15th instant to join the militia of Tryon country, to raise the siege of Fort Stanwix. 
</p><p>
Upon my leaving <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, the prospect this 
way appeared most gloomy, but the severe checks 
the enemy have met with at Bennington and Tryon 
county, have given a more pleasing view of public 
affairs. Particular accounts of the signal victory gained by General Stark, and of the severe blow General Herkimer gave Sir John Johnson and the scalpers 
under his command, have been transmitted to your 
Excellency by <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel=''>General Schuyler</a>. I anxiously expect 
the arrival of an express from <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel=''>General Arnold</a>, with 
an account of the total defeat of the enemy in that 
quarter. By my calculation, he reached Fort Stanwix 
the day before yesterday. 
</p><p>
Colonels Livingston's and Cortlandt's regiments arrived yesterday, and immediately joined General Poor's 
division. I shall also order <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel=''>General Arnold</a>, upon his 
return, to march to that post. I cannot sufficiently 
thank your Excellency for sending Colonel Morgan's 
corps to this army; they will be of the greatest service to it; for, until the late success this way, I am 
told the army were quite panic-struck by the Indians, and their Tory and Canadian assassins in Indian 
dress. Horrible, indeed, have been the cruelties they 
have wantonly committed upon the miserable inhabit 
ants, insomuch that all is now fair with <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel=''>General Burgoyne</a>, even if the bloody hatchet he has so barbarously used should find its way into his own head. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel=''>Governor Clinton</a> will be here to-day. Upon his 
arrival, I shall consult with him and <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel=''>General Lincoln</a> 
upon the best plan to distress, and I hope finally to 
defeat the enemy. I am sorry to be necessitated to 
acquaint your Excellency how neglectfully your orders have been executed at Springfield; not any of 
the musket ball, or lead, which you ordered so long 
ago to be sent to this department, is yet arrived, 
and I am exceedingly distressed for the want of it. 
Upon my arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, I despatched an express 
to Colonel Hughes, with the inclosed return of ordnance stores wanted in this department, and directed 
what he could not furnish might be immediately ordered to be supplied from Springfield. Few of the 
militia demanded are yet arrived, but I hear of great 
numbers upon the march. Your Excellency's advice 
in regard to Morgan's corps, &c., &c., shall be care 
fully observed. My scouts and spies inform me, that 
the enemy's head-quarters and main body are at <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, and that they have lately been repairing the 
bridges between that place and Stillwater. 
</p><p>
As soon as times and circumstances will admit, I 
shall send your Excellency a general return of this 
army. I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant 
</p><p>
