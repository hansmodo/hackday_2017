I remained in camp all day Sunday trying to rest, but was prevented from doing so by the devilish mosquitoes. They are a perfect pest here, and have nearly devoured some of our party. In order to free ourselves of these pests, we have built small fires at night for the purpose of smoking them off, but which would prove the greatest nuisance, the smoke or the mosquitoes, we were not able to determine.

This morning I accompanied Atkins across the Calaveras, where I collected the five dollars due me for last Wednesday's work. He engaged to work at haymaking for five dollars per day and commenced forthwith. I then returned to camp and packed his blankets and forwarded them across the river where he can get them after his first day's work is over. This is the first labor he has undertaken since leaving <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, and I fear he will not be able to endure this many days. Messrs. Cox, Hilliard & Co. purchased scythes this morning at thirty-five dollars each, and are going into the hay business tomorrow. The grass is
good, and any one can cut who chooses. Hay is now worth twenty to thirty dollars per ton, and this will pay better than almost anything else at this time.

About twilight a coon fight took place in the bushes quite near camp. We immediately went in chase but they escaped. Coons are quite abundant here, and badgers are also found. This evening I packed my blankets into town in order to get to work in the Times office.
