</p><p>
GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
I wrote, on the 11th instant, advising you of our present situation and that of the enemy, and took the liberty of presenting  you my sentiments on a future plan of operation, for which 
my zeal for the public service, I hope, will apologize ; since 
which I have made an estimate (which I now inclose) of such 
artillery stores, ammunition, &c., which I imagine will be necessary. If it is thought proper to carry on a siege in form, of 
this I can be no judge, as I know not if powder can be spared 
from below, or shot, shells, &c., sent up in season. The artillery, except a thirteen-inch mortar (at Crown Point), is all in 
this country. I have also inclosed a list of such ammunition, 
stores, &c., as we have on hand. A list of such articles as can 
be procured at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, St. John s, and <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, will be taken 
and sent you by <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a>. 
</p><p>
I had encouragement from Monsieur Pallasier, at Three Rivers, 
of being furnished with shot, shells, &c., in all the month of 
March. I have this minute received advice from him, that the 
want of coal will prevent his supplying those articles before May. 
As coal is his only objection, I have wrote him to procure it, at 
all events, if it can be done, to supply shells, &c., by the 1st 
of April; of which the bearer, Major Ogden, will inform. This 
measure, I hope, will meet your approbation, as the expense of 
bringing shells from below will be great, and, if not wanted here, 
the cost will be trifling. 
</p><p>
It is very probable the city would surrender before half, or 
perhaps one quarter, of the shot, shells, &c. in my memorandum 
were expended; but, if they should make an obstinate resistance, 
perhaps the whole will be necessary. A gentleman now present 
assures me, that the King's magazines, containing upwards of 
three thousand barrels of powder, were all full, and that three 
hundred barrels, his private property, taken from him by Government, was obliged to be stored in a private vault. Add to this 
ten thousand stand of arms, seven thousand of which are new, 
and arrived last summer; also seven thousand complete suits of 
new clothing, with a large quantity of artillery stores, two frigates with a number of other vessels in the harbour, &c., &lt;fcc. 
The above-mentioned articles, exclusive of securing an extensive 
country in our interest, and liberating three or four hundred of 
our brave men, appear an object of the greatest importance to 
us under our present circumstances. I make no doubt every 
necessary measure will be adopted for reducing the city. 
</p><p>
Yesterday arrived here a reenforcement of one hundred men 
from <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> ; sixty men are soon expected. We are still very 
weak-handed ; of course the duty severe ; however, the enemy 
have not dared to come out, though they are double our numbers. Desertions from the garrison are frequent. They are in 
want of fuel, and have attempted to supply themselves by cut 
ting down the houses in St. Roc's suburbs (under their guns,) 
to prevent which I have burnt most of them, with several vessels they had broke up. Every artifice is used by Governor 
Carleton to procure provisions, and induce the Canadians to take 
arms against us, to no effect, though seconded by the clergy, our 
bitter enemies. I make no doubt of continuing the blockade until a proper reinforcement arrives to make use of more coercive measures. 
</p><p>
Major Ogden, the bearer of this to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, who came out 
with me a volunteer, proposes going down to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. I 
beg leave to recommend him as a gentleman who has acted 
with great spirit and activity through our fatiguing march, and 
at the attack on Quebec, in which he was wounded. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a>, on his arrival in this country, was pleased to appoint Mr. John Halsted Commissary. He is a gentle 
man who has been very active and zealous in our cause, is a 
merchant, and capable in his department, in which I beg leave 
to recommend his being continued. 
</p><p>
Our finances are low ; we have been obliged to beg, borrow, 
and squeeze to get money for our subsistence; and, but for Mr. 
Price, who has been our greatest resource, we must have suffered. 
</p><p>
I have the agreeable intelligence from <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a>, that the Paymaster is at hand. I am, with great esteem, very respectfully, Gentlemen, &c. 
</p><p>
