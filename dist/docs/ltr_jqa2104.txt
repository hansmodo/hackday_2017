MY DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
The people indeed everywhere ardently sigh for peace. 
Everywhere they perceive that they have been made the 
victims of their own passions and follies. They are everywhere becoming more and more convinced that the struggle 
which they are still obliged to maintain, although its original 
object has completely failed on both sides, can only be destructive to them, and they would gladly bury in oblivion 
the abstracted madness which created such a fanatical agitation of their brains about three years ago. But in all the 
governments of Europe new and old the people are considered 
as an instrument, not as the object, of political calculations. 
Their interests, their feelings, and their wishes are not the 
ultimate point of contemplation, but only a power over which 
the control of the superintendent is more or less efficacious 
according to the progress of events. The ruling powers 
therefore here and in France, finding the spirits of their 
combatants much exhausted, encourage them with hopes of 
peace, and at the same time are taking infinite pains to continue the war, and to shift each upon the other the odium of that continuance. 
</p><p>
At the opening of the present session of Parliament the 
royal speech prepared the way for a sort of acknowledgment of the new French government, without which no pretence of negotiation could have been raised and supported. 
Soon after a message from the king formally declared that 
he would meet any disposition to negotiate on the part of 
France. Upon a debate which recently took place Mr. 
Pitt declared that measures were taking which might lead 
to a negotiation, and even at this day reports of actually 
pending arrangements are industriously circulated and kept 
up by the ministerial influence. On the other hand a message from the Executive Directory of France to the Legislative body some time since expressly said that the enemies, 
or rather that enemies, of France had spoken of peace, and 
the same message professed a very cordial desire to terminate the war. 
</p><p>
All this on both sides appears to be mere profession with 
out sincerity. If the parties were really inclined to peace, 
their pretensions as to the conditions of it are too widely 
distant for them to meet without a further struggle. But 
the governments both of France and Britain dread the con 
sequences of peace themselves. The armies of France are 
such formidable and unwieldy machines that the persons 
in power are very unwilling to take them from that employment which removes their attention from home ; while in 
this country the monarchy and aristocracy view in horror the prospect of a Republican establishment so near to them selves. 
</p><p>
The last pamphlet of Burke, which I lately sent you, discovers this temper in its natural colors, and another, professedly written upon the subject and entitled "Thoughts 
upon the Prospect of a Regicide Peace," is announced for 
publication within a short period. Their object is probably 
to make a further experiment at fanaticizing the public 
mind, or at least to revive the flame which has long been 
drooping, and of late has been ready to expire. It is con 
tending yet for ground which the ministers no longer dare 
openly to avow, but which their ostensible declarations rather disclaim. 
</p><p>
Your ever affectionate and grateful son.
