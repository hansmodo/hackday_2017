DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Yours of the 10th came to hand the last evening, with the coffee, and 
shall be obliged to you to send me a few pounds of sugar per bearer. 
Provisions are so scarce here, that I am obliged to send boats down for 
rice. You will send by express thirty barrels, from whoever may have 
it, without regard of public or private property or engagements. If 
Heriot and Tucker have any by them, it must be taken from them, 
notwithstanding anything they may say, for without a supply I must 
move down, which would be of the worse consequence, until I can fully 
see the treaty properly executed. Mr. Fanning is very busy in recruiting men. On Friday next Ganey is to have a meeting of his people, to 
see who are to go to town, and who stay. I only wait until then, when 
I shall march over the river and overawe those who may be wavering, 
or will not give up or go to town. If Major Skelly is landed, I desire 
he may be parolled in a house where he may be genteelly and politely 
treated; and you will tell them I should have no objection to parole 
him to Charlestown, if he would get Lieut. Henry Ravenel parolled 
within our lines. I am told he is put in the provost; if so, Major Skelly will be detained until he is liberated. You will give the Major 
a flag to <a href='/results.php?tla=all' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Leslie</a>, to effect that matter, and send his letters, after 
perusing them ; this I wish may be done immediately. Enquire of the 
captain of the vessel who captured Major Skelly, if he found no letters 
or papers about him, as he must be charged with some important business to the Commander in Georgia. Three boats set out this day for 
the rice; if they can take more than thirty barrels, they must bring 
them. I beg the rice may be ready by the time they arrive. 
I am, dear sir, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>

N. B. Let me know if the man sent to Gov. Martin with my despatches has returned.
