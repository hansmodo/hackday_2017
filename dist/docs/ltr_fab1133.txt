I wrote you a long letter to go by the last mail but the day before the mail was to leave this place, it was about half burnt up and the Post Office, mail, etc., with the rest. It was only a little fire for this country--about 20 or 30 buildings and $100,000 worth of property all out in one hour! We saved our side of the street with some difficulty
by hanging wet blankets on our stores and pulled down some buildings and let the rest burn. It will soon be built up again.

Cole is packing between here and Shasta. Sarah has gotten as far as Shasta and may be out this trip. We have bought a train of 14 mules and shall do our own packing in the future. This will save us a great deal of expense.

Cole says he saw Sewall in Sacramento, broke. Which means he hadn't 'nary a red.' He has not written me for a long time.

Our business is fair and increasing and if the mines pay well we shall come out ditto, as last winter I was obliged to trust a good deal and in spite of all my precautions we have $1800 credited, but I think most of it is good. The law in this country is good for collecting debts. I have several times been obliged to sue in this country until I have gotten to be quite a lawyer. I have never lost a case yet. I made out the papers today and saved $85 by sueing a note that I have.

I am getting tired of this kind of life and have fully made up my mind that when I do leave I will go into a civilized community for a short time at least, and, by the way, in order to civilize our town we want a school marm. There are ten or fifteen children running about the streets, growing up perfectly savage and their parents would be glad to pay some one well to train them. I have told several that where I come from the market is stocked with school mistresses and that I would write and order one immediately. Now, if you know of anyone (a young girl preferred, of course) who wants to make her board and one hundred dollars per month, here is a splendid opening--great chances to marry, too. Now, without joking, the parents here do want one very much and there are lots of little Diggers, bright little boys, owned by men who would be ready to send them if there was an
opportunity. You ought also, when you are giving money to send missionaries to the Kanakas and the Africans, remember that we are here without any religion, no Sunday, no church, no minister--with a dozen families of children growing up ignorant of anything but Monte and learning to swear. Truly we are a curious state of society and the millennium seems far off.

I think some of going down below in a month or two.

It seems a long time since I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a> and longer to look ahead to the time when I shall be able to go back. I sometimes think I will settle down here for life and then I have a letter from Pond or someone else, describing his voyage to Valparaiso, the fine times he had, the beautiful Senoritas, and I get homesick and discontented and think I will abandon everything and fly to some other country where I can live. But then, it takes money to do all these things and I go on weighing out butter and sugar, etc., taking care to give exact weight on the butter and down weight on the gold dust and wishing that I was as sharp as Cobb used to be when I was in his store. If I only had H. D. Brookman's character I would get rich here in two years, but I have no faculty for making money. I should make a splendid Consulor Minister to some foreign country.

Well, I think if I were talking to you you would say 'dry up.' I'll do it.
