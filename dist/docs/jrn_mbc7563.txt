<a rel='month origin' value='5'>May</a> <a rel='day origin' value='27'>27th</a>  [<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city origin'>CHARLESTON</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. They look for a fight at Norfolk. <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> is there. I think if I were a man I'd be there, too. 
Also Harper's Ferry is to be attacked. The Confederate flag has been cut down at Alexandria by a man named Ells 
worth, who was in command of Zouaves. Jackson was the name of the person who shot Ellsworth in the act. Sixty 
of our cavalry have been taken by Sherman's brigade. Deeper and deeper we go in.

Thirty of Tom Boykin's company have come home from Richmond. They went as a rifle company, armed with muskets. They were sandhill tackeys those fastidious ones, not very anxious to fight with anything, or in any way, 
I fancy. Richmond ladies had come for them in carriages, feted them, waved handkerchiefs to them, brought them 
dainties with their own hands, in the faith that every Carolinian was a gentleman, and every man south of Mason 
and Dixon's line a hero. But these are not exactly descendants of the Scotch Hay, who fought the Danes with his 
plowshare, or the oxen's yoke, or something that could hit hard and that came handy.

Johnny has gone as a private in Gregg's regiment. He could not stand it at home any longer. Mr. Chesnut was 
willing for him to go, because those sandhill men said " this was a rich man's war," and the rich men would be 
the officers and have an easy time and the poor ones would be privates. So he said: " Let the gentlemen set the example; let them go in the ranks." So John Chesnut is a gentleman private. He took his servant with him all the same.

Johnny reproved me for saying, " If I were a man, I would not sit here and dole and drink and drivel and for 
get the fight going on in Virginia." He said it was my duty not to talk so rashly and make enemies. He had the 
money in his pocket to raise a company last fall, but it has slipped through his fingers, and now he is a common soldier." " You wasted it or spent it foolishly," said I. I do not know where it has gone, said he. There was 
too much consulting over me, too much good counsel was given to me, and everybody gave me different advice." 
" Don't you ever know your own mind? " " We will do very well in the ranks ; men and officers all alike ; we know everybody.

So I repeated Mrs. Lowndes's solemn words when she heard that South Carolina, had seceded alone: " As thy 
days so shall thy strength be." Don't know exactly what I meant, but thought I must be impressive as he was going 
away. Saw him off at the train. Forgot to say anything there, but cried my eyes out.

Sent Mrs. Wigfall a telegram " Where shrieks the wild sea-mew? : She answered: " Sea-mew at the Spotswood Hotel. Will shriek soon. I will remain here.
