Sir, 
</p><p>
At the moment of my departure for <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> this 
morning, I received a letter from M. de Yaudreuil, 
saying that he is sorry to have appointed the 8th 
of next month for my arrival with my troops at 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, because the men-of-war at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> are 
not yet ready, and he does not believe that he will 
be in readiness to set sail before the 20th of November. In consequence of which, I have resolved 
to stay here four days longer ; then to go as far as 
<a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, by very short journeys, where I shall 
stay until the fleet be ready. By these means I 
shall have more time to receive intelligence from 
your Excellency concerning the motions of the enemy, and to know, first, if Admiral Pigot is really 
gone with a part of the fleet to the West Indies ; 
secondly, if the counter order for the non-evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> has really been sent as it is reported; 
thirdly, if this counter order is arrived timely enough 
to hinder the evacuation; on which three objects I 
beg of your Excellency to inform me, as you know 
that on these objects depends the embarkation of the 
troops, or their not embarking. 
</p><p>
I shall leave two hussars at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and two at 
Voluntown, to bring me your Excellency's letters at 
<a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>. I am, with respect and personal attachment. Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
