Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On the 1st instant, I had the pleasure of receiving your favour of the 21st May hist. 
</p><p>
I am happy to hear that the provisional articles meet 
with general approbation. The tories will doubtless cause 
some difficulty, bul thai they have always done, and as this 
will probably be the hist time, we musl m; : best of it. 
A universal indiscriminate condemnation and expulsion of 
those people, would not r< dound to our honour, because so 
harsh a measure would partake more of vengeance than of 
justice. For my part, I wish that all except the faith 
and the cruel may be forgiven. That exception would 
indeed extend to very few ; but even if it applied to the 
case of one only, that one ought, in my opinion, to be 
saved. 
</p><p>
The reluctance with which the States in general pay the 
necessary taxes, is much to be regretted ; it injures both 
their reputation and interest abroad, as well as at home, 
and tends to cherish the hopes and speculations of those 
who wish we may become and remain an unimportant, 
divided people. The rising power of America is a serious 
object of apprehension to more than one nation, and every 
event that may retard it will be agreeable to them. A 
continental, national spirit should therefore pervade our 
country, and Congress should be enabled, by a grant of the 
necessary powers, to regulate the commerce and general 
concerns of the confederacy ; and we should remember 
that to be constantly prepared for war, is the only way to 
have peace. The Swiss on the one hand, and the Dutch 
on the other, bear testimony to the truth of this remark. 
</p><p>
The general and the army have, by their late moderation, 
done themselves infinite honour ; and it is to be hoped that 
the States will not only be just, but generous to those brave 
and virtuous citizens. America is at present held in a very 
respectable point of view, but as the eyes of the world are 
upon her, the continuance of that consideration will depend 
on the dignity and wisdom of her conduct. 
</p><p>
I mean to return next spring. My health is somewhat 
better. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate and humble servant, 
</p><p>
