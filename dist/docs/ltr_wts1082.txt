Dear Brother : I am now writing upon the risk of your 
not receiving this, for I hear that you are engaged in 
speculating in salt, and are waiting for the river to rise 
to take a load down to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>. Are you doing this 
on borrowed capital or not? Or does it interfere in the 
least with your duties as engineer ? If it does, I would 
advise you not to engage in it at any rate, even if you 
can make a fortune by it ; for a reputation for a strict 
and rigid compliance to one's duties, whatever they may 
be, is far more valuable than a dozen loads of salt. If, 
however, you do engage in it, of course I wish you 
success, a pleasant trip to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>, and hope you will 
make a long stay, for Lampson's sake.

I suppose you know that we have two examinations 
here every year, one in January and the other in June. 
At the latter a number of gentlemen from all parts of 
the United States attend by invitation of the Secretary 
of War, and of course we all endeavor to be well prepared 
in our studies, both for our own good and that the persons (always influential) may carry off a good opinion 
of the Institution. The course of studies we are engaged in this year has always had the reputation of being 
the most difficult of the four, and that justly ; therefore 
to be prepared for the coming June examination I expect 
to be very studious and busy, and if between this time 
and then I be not very regular in my correspondence, you 
may know what to attribute it to and excuse it. 
Your affectionate brother, 
</p><p>
