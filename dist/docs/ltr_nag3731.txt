Sir, 
</p><p>
Since I wrote to your Excellency, a day or two ago, Lieutenant-<a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a> has been killed in an 
action on the Combahee River, about fifty miles south 
of our camp. The enemy made a detachment into that 
quarter, with a number of armed vessels, empty sloops 
and schooners, with about five hundred infantry, to 
collect rice. General Gist, with the light troops, in 
Avhich Lieutenant-<a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a> held a command, 
was detached to oppose them. Inclosed is a copy of 
General Gist's letter containing an account of the 
different operations. <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a>'s fall is glorious ; but liis fate is much to be lamented. Your Excellency has lost a valuable Aid-de-camp, the army a 
brave officer, and the public a worthy and patriotic citizen. 
</p><p>
The enemy made a descent upon Santee, some 
little time since, to collect rice, in which they were 
but too successful. The situation in which it lay, 
prevented <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a> from giving them any considerable interruption. The rivers of this country are 
very flivorable for this kind of enterprises ; but I am 
in hopes the enemy will get but little by their present expedition. 
</p><p>
It is said that Admiral Pigot is on this coast with 
near thirty sail of the line, to take off the garrison 
of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. A part of the fleet is to take post 
at Beaufort, to take off the garrison of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. It 
is said the enemy, within a few days past, have been 
meditating an attack upon us. I have the honor to 
be, with great respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
