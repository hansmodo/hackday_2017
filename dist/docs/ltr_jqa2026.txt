MY DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
If we are truly informed the election of President and Vice-President is decided by the votes of which we have already heard, and which extend no further than Maryland. 
From the indication of the disposition of the people I feel 
much personal gratification, as it shows that the aspersions 
of private malice and of public faction have had no success 
in shaking the reverence and affection which your country 
men entertained for you, and which you have so richly 
deserved of them ; but I feel still more satisfaction on their 
account, because it shows their attachment to the government itself, and that the artifices of unprincipled ambition 
or of misguided jealousy have not led them astray from the 
pursuit of their own essential interests. Great pains it 
seems were taken to unite the opposition in favor of Governor Clinton, and canvassing letters were received by the 
electors in Rhode Island and Connecticut from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, 
and even from Virginia. But in both the former States the 
electors and the people, instead of being influenced by those 
letters, resented very much such an insidious attack upon 
the liberty of their suffrages, and their unanimous votes 
may convince the abettors of anarchy and confusion that 
at this time they have "overleapt themselves and fallen on 
the other side."

The subject of theatrical amusements still continues a 
gentle agitation in this town. We had yesterday a town 
meeting to consider the propriety of remonstrating to the 
Legislature against the prohibitory statute. You will see 
the remonstrance, together with sundry resolutions and an 
address to be presented upon the occasion to the Governor, 
in this day's Centinel, and you will find my name there with 
twenty others as a Committee to present the address, etc. 
The town meeting was more numerous than usual, and yet 
other party absented themselves, knowing very well that 
they would be out-voted, if they made their appearance. 
Our friend Otis, you will see, is also upon the Commit 
tee, though he was decided in his opposition to the last 
year's petition for the repeal. He was present at this meet 
ing, and after being chosen upon the Committee, he made a 
short speech in which he said that he always felt happy in 
endeavoring to promote the wishes of his fellow citizens, 
and very cheerfully submitted to the decision of the majority, 
even when it was contrary to his own opinion ; that he would 
therefore with pleasure co-operate in any measures to ex 
press the sentiments of the town and to obtain the object 
which they desired. But in order to avoid an appearance 
of inconsistency he thought it necessary to declare, that he 
had seen no reason to alter a single sentiment of the opinion 
which he had formerly expressed, and he still continued to 
think that a theatre would do no good to the town. It was 
a little singular that Sullivan was nominated four or five 
times to be a member of this same Committee and upon 
being put was negatived by a majority of votes against him. 
From several circumstances I have reason to suspect that 
his nomination came from Jarvis, whose policy upon this 
occasion seems to be to press into the service all the men of 
abilities or influence who have been in the opposition. But 
with respect to Sullivan the object failed ; for so long as his 
being on the other side afforded the voters a decent pretext 
for voting against him, a majority was found who chose to 
gratify their inclination to vote against him at any rate. 
So soon as the number of the Committee was completed, Jarvis made a speech, in which he said he hoped it would be 
universally understood that the negative passed upon Mr. Sullivan was not from any intended disrespect to him, but only because it was conceived his official situation made it 
improper to require his aid to obtain a repeal of the law. 
This smoothed the matter over well enough, but several 
persons told me they voted against him, because they were 
glad of an opportunity to insult a man whom they hated 
and despised. Here then the matter rests, and I am apprehensive you will think me tedious in giving so minute a 
detail of it. ...
