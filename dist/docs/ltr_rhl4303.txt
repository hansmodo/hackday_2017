Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I was unwilling to interrupt your attention to more 
important affairs at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, by sending there 
an acknowledgment of the letter that you were pleased to honor me with from that city, especially as 
this place afforded nothing worthy of your notice.

We have the pleasure to see the first act of Congress for selling federal lands, north-west of the Ohio, 
becoming productive very fast, a large sum of public 
securities being already paid in upon the first sales ; 
and a new contract is ordered to be made with a 
company in New Jersey for the lands between the two JNIiamis, that will rid us of at least two millions more of the public debt. There is good reason to 
suppose that by the next spring we shall have reduced the domestic debt near six millions of dollars. 
And it seems clear that the lands yet to be disposed 
of, if well managed, will sink the whole thirty millions that are due.

The assiduity with which the Court of London is 
soliciting that of Spain for the conclusion of a commercial treaty between those powers, renders it a signal misfortune that we have not been able to get a 
sufficient number of the States together to produce a 
conclusion of the Spanish treaty. The state of Europe, with respect to the continuance of peace, still 
hangs in doubtful balance. The finance weakness of 
France and Great Britain most strongly opposes war ; 
yet the state of things is such as renders it very 
questionable whether even that difficulty, great as it 
is, will secure the continuance of peace.

It is under the strongest impressions of your goodness and candor that I venture to make the observations that follow in this letter, assuring you that I 
feel it among the first distresses that have happened 
to me in my life, that I find myself compelled, by 
irresistible conviction of mind, to doubt about the 
new system for Federal Government recommended by 
the late Convention. 
</p><p>
It is. Sir, in consequence of long reflection upon 
the nature of man and of government, that I am led 
to fear the danger that will ensue to civil liberty 
from the adoption of the new system, in its present 
form. I am fully sensible of the propriety of change 
in the present plan of Confederation ; and, although 
there may be difficulties, not inconsiderable, in procuring the adoption of such amendments to the Convention system, as will give security to the just 
rights of human nature, and better secure from injury the discordant interests of the different parts of 
this Union, yet I hope that these difficulties are not 
insurmountable, because we are- happily uninterrupted 
by external war, or by such internal discords as can 
prevent peaceable and fair discussion, in another Convention, of those objections that are fundamentally 
strong against the new Constitution, which abounds 
with useful regulations. As there is so great a part 
of the business w^ell done already, I think that such 
alterations as must give very general content, could 
not long employ another Convention, when provided 
with the sense of the different States upon those 
alterations. 
</p><p>
I am much inclined to believe that the amendments, 
generally thought to be necessary, will be found to 
be of such a nature as, though they do not oppose 
the exercise of a very competent federal powder, are 
yet such as the best theories on Government, and 
the best practice upon those theories, have found necessary ; at the same time that they are such as the 
opinions of our people have for ages been fixed on. 
It would be unnecessary for me here to enumerate 
particulars, as I expect the honor of waiting on you 
at <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, in my way home, early in November. In the mean time, I have only to request that 
my best respects may be presented to your lady, 
and that I may be remembered to the rest of the 
good family of <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, dear Sir, with the most unfeigned respect, esteem and affection, &c., 
</p><p>
