SIR, 
</p><p>
I have received your agreeable letter, of the 7th 
instant, per Captain Sears. The condition and circumstances of the Colony of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> give me pain, 
lest the friends to American liberty in that Colony should be too much neglected and become disheartened, and the inimical designs and mischievous operations of others succeed. I have received credible 
information that the Provincial Congress there had spent some time, just before they adjourned to the 1st of February, in debating whether they should not 
address Mr. Tryon for the purpose of calling the General Assembly of that Colony, to revive the old 
scheme of adopting the Parliamentary insult of the 20th of February last, which was rejected. Surely our friends want to be strengthened, and our enemies to be checked. 
</p><p>
The following is an extract from a letter from one 
of our friends to another, dated December 27th, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>. "Just after you left town, the Phoenix, a forty-gun ship, arrived and anchored just before Mr. Drake s, 
and in two or three days after, the Asia, in company 
of the Duchess of Gordon, came and anchored opposite to Peck's slip, so that we are highly honored. 
General Dalrymple is on board the Phoenix, and it 
is rumored that they have two hundred troops concealed on board, which has, for near a week past, 
kept us on pretty hard duty. The Colonel has slept 
in the barracks two or three nights. If they come 1 
hope to give a good account of them. We have 
some excellent field-pieces, and if they visit us the 
gates will be opened, and we will welcome them 
with a few 7 resolves of the Continental Congress, which 
is the name of one of the pieces." 
</p><p>
I wrote a letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=joh' rel='colleague'>President Hancock</a>, dated the 
6th of January, and another to one of our Delegates 
at Congress, requesting that more effectual measures 
may be taken for the security of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, to prevent our enemies from being supplied with provisions, 
furnished with intelligence, and from having an opportunity to use every artifice to insult and injure 
us from that quarter. It therefore gave me sensible 
pleasure to find, that you have adopted the measures 
mentioned in yours, and with great cheerfulness 
called my council, and, with their advice, appointed 
Colonel Waterbury, Lieutenant-Colonel Bradley, and 
Major Hobby, field-officers for one regiment ; Colonel 
Ward, Lieutenant-Colonel Lewis, and Major Douglas 
for another. Sent a proclamation to the two Colonels, 
and orders to them with the rest of the field-officers, 
by voluntary enlistment, to raise seven hundred and 
fifty men each, to join and assist Major-General Lee, 
with encouragement that they should be entitled to 
the same pay, wages, and billeting allowed the troops 
before <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, during the time they served, and to be 
dismissed soon, when the service would conveniently 
admit. 
</p><p>
The field-officers of each regiment to select captains and subalterns from those in the standing militia ; if needful, to request the chief officer of the 
militia companies to call their companies together for 
the purpose of enlisting the men with expedition ; 
and, to prevent difficulty for want of ammunition, 
have ordered Captain Niles, Commander of our armed 
schooner, the Spy, to take on board half a ton of 
powder, and transport four hundred pounds to New 
Haven, two hundred pounds to Norwalk, and four 
hundred pounds to Stamford, with orders to him to 
follow such directions as Major-General Lee may give 
for the service he is employed in, and to execute 
the same, until dismissed by him, or further orders 
from me. Wished, but failed, to have the pleasure 
of a short interview with him. When my orders 
w T ere ready, very early on Saturday morning last, 
Captain Sears took them, and I apprehend he got to 
<a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a> by noon. I wrote to Major-General Lee, in 
forming of what was done by me. I have no doubt 
but the men at the westward part of this Colony 
will readily and expedition sly engage in the service. 
May the Supreme Director of all events add His 
blessing on our endeavours to preserve, support, and 
maintain the constitutional liberties of these Colonies, 
which he hath made it our duty to do. 
</p><p>
Thirteen Indians, of the Caghnawaga tribe, came to visit me on the 13th, and seemed well pleased to have a conference on our affairs, and expressed their 
belief of my information, and that they were friends and brothers, and yesterday proceeded on their way to you. I am, with great esteem and regard, your 
Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
