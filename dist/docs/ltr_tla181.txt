Dear Brother<br>
The worst has happened. The Banks have closed this morning and I am broke. I do not know how things are going but my practice has been getting poorer all the time and do not know which way to turn. You can use your own judgement about telling mother but suppose she may as well know the worst.<br><br>

Lots of love to mother
