<p><i>[Biographers Note:The season being too far advanced to attempt any further movements
away from our base of supplies, and the same reasons preventing any
advance of the Federal forces, the campaign in this part of Virginia
ended for the winter.  In the Kanawha Valley, however, the enemy had
been and were quite active.  Large reinforcements under General
Rosecrans were sent there to assist General Cox, the officer in command
at that point.  General Loring, leaving a sufficient force to watch
the enemy at Cheat Mountain, moved the rest of his army to join the
commands of Generals Floyd and Wise, who were opposing the advance of
Cox.  General Lee, about September 20th, reached General Floyd's camp,
and immediately proceeded to arrange the lines of defense.  Shortly
after his arrival there he wrote to my mother at the Hot Springs:]</i>

I have just received, dear Mary, your letter of the 17th and 19th
instants, with one from Robert.  I have but little time for writing
to-night, and will, therefore, write to you....  Having now disposed
of business matters, I will say how glad I am to hear from you, and
to learn that you have reached the Hot in safety, with daughter and
Rob.  I pray that its healing waters may benefit you all.  I am glad
to hear of Charlotte and the girls, and hope all will go well with
them.  I infer you received my letter before leaving Valley Mountain,
though you did not direct your letter 'via Lewisburg, Greenbrier
County,' and hence its delay.  I told you of the death of Colonel
Washington.  I grieve for his loss, though trust him to the mercy of
our Heavenly Father.  May He have mercy on us all.

It is raining heavily.  The men are all exposed on the mountain, with
the enemy opposite to us.  We are without tents, and for two nights I
have lain buttoned up in my overcoat.  To-day my tent came up and I
am in it.  Yet I fear I shall not sleep for thinking of the poor men.
I wrote about socks for myself.  I have no doubt the yarn ones you
mention will be very acceptable to the men here or elsewhere.  If you
can send them here, I will distribute them to the most needy.  Tell
Rob I could not write to him for want of time.  My heart is always
with you and my children.  May God guard and bless you all is the
constant prayer of
