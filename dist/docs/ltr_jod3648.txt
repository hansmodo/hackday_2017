MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YOUR letters of the 21,22, 23, and 26th of April, are 
all before me. They have inspired me with all the 
melancholy in which they were written. Our mother and our niece are gone to rest. The first a fruitfully 
ripe, the last but a blossom or a bud. I have suffered 
for you as much as you have suffered, but I could 
give you no aid, or amusement, or comfort. I pray 
God that these dispensations may be for our good. 
My mother's countenance and conversation was a 
source of enjoyment to me that is now dried up for 
ever, at <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>. Our ancestors are now all gone, 
and we are to follow them very soon to a country 
where there will be no war or rumor of war, no envy, 
jealousy, rivalry, or party. 
</p><p>
You and I are now entering on a new scene, which 
will be the most difficult and least agreeable of any 
in our lives. I hope the burden will be lighter lo 
both of us, when we come together. 
</p><p>
I am, as long as life lasts, your ever affectionate 
</p><p>
