By this time, my dear Sir, you will have again renewed your attention to your domestic affairs, after 
the long absence occasioned by the Convention. I flatter myself with the hope that you found Mrs. Washington and your family in perfect health. 
</p><p>
Every point of view in which I have been able to 
place the subject, induces me to believe that the moment in which the Convention assembled, and the result thereof, are to be estimated among those fortunate circumstances in the affairs of men, which give 
a decided influence to the happiness of society for a 
long period of time. Hitherto every thing promises 
well. The new Constitution is received with great joy 
by all the commercial part of the community. The 
people of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> are in raptures with it as it is, but 
would have liked it still better had it been highertoned. The people of Jersey and Connecticut, who 
are not commercial, embrace it with ardor. There has 
not yet elapsed sufficient time to hear from the interior parts of the other States, excepting this, which, 
however, does not seem to have decided on its plan 
of conduct. It will not probably, however, be among 
the first which shall adopt it; but I presume the 
powerful circumstance of interest will ultimately induce it to comply. As the information now appears, 
Virginia probably will give the new plan the most 
formidable opposition. The unanimous resolve of Congress to transmit it to the respective States, will not 
lessen the general disposition to receive it. But, notwithstanding my strong persuasion that it will be 
adopted generally, and in a much shorter time than 
I some time ago believed, yet it will be opposed, 
more or less, in most of the States. 
</p><p>
The germ of opposition originated in the Convention itself. The gentlemen who refused signing it, 
will most probably conceive themselves obliged to 
state their reasons publicly. The presses will groan 
with melancholy forebodings, and a party of some 
strength will be created. This is an evil, but it is 
an infinitely lesser evil than that we should have 
crumbled to pieces by mere imbecility. I trust in 
God that the foundation of a good national Government is laid. A way is opened to such alterations 
and amendments, from time to time, as shall be judged necessary; and the Government, being subjected 
to a revision by the people, will not be so liable to 
abuse. The first Legislature ought to be the ablest 
and most disinterested men of the community. Every 
well-founded objection which shall be stated in the 
course of the discussions on the subject, should be 
fairly considered, and such fundamental laws enacted 
as would tend to obviate them.

Mrs. Knox unites with me in presenting our most 
affectionate respects to Mrs. Washington. 
</p><p>
I am, my dear Sir, with the sincerest and most respectful friendship, &c., 
</p><p>
