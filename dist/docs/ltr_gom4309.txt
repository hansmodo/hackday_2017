My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had hopes, until last evening, that the persons, 
who are to go out as Commissioners from hence, 
would have embarked with Captain Culver; but circumstances have delayed the appointment. The plan 
which was in agitation, and which will probably be 
carried into effect, is to send over three or four Commissioners, one of whom will be charged with Letters 
of Credence, but instructed to conform to the directions of the Board. It is probable that the new Minister, immediately on being presented, will ask you 
to aid in securing the person and papers of the old 
one. My public despatch of this day contains a remote hint to lead the investigation of the Secretary 
of State. I did not choose to be more particular, because you can both give and take the informations 
you think proper. 
</p><p>
I have favored, or rather excited the idea of this 
procedure, for the following reasons. First, such a 
public act will place in a contemptible light the faction connected with M. Genet. Secondly, the seizure 
of his papers, by exposing his connections with prime 
movers, will give a lesson to others. And thirdly, the 
Commissioners who exercise this high-handed authority will, on reflection, feel the necessity of respecting 
your Government, lest they should meet a similar 
fate. Having alarmed their apprehensions, as to the 
effect which M. Genet's imprudence might produce, 
and knowing the public and private views of the parties, I have insinuated the advantage which might result from an early declaration on the part of the new 
Minister, that, as France has announced her determination not to meddle with the interior affairs of other 
nations, so he can know only the Government of America. In unison with this idea, I told the Minister 
that I had observed an overruling influence in their 
affairs, which seemed to come from the other side of 
the Channel, and at the same time had traced the 
intention to excite a seditious spirit in America ; 
that it was impossible to be on a friendly footing 
with such persons ; but that at present a different 
spirit seemed to prevail. This declaration produced 
the effect I intended. The Minister has himself the 
wish to go out to America as Plenipotentiary, and 
M. Otto, his principal Secretary, having the same 
wish, they will, I believe, endeavour, while they stay, 
to put things in good train here. 
</p><p>
It may be an important judicial question, how far 
the Minister is protected by the law of nations, after 
the arrival of his successor. In my opinion, the same 
principles, which exempt him from the municipal law, 
subject him to the will of his sovereign, and, of 
course, the aid given to the new Minister is not an 
act of the judiciary but of the Executive^ performed as 
an ally and friend, and is merely discretionary. I find 
that this Commission will endeavour to get hold of 
the debt from America to France by anticipation. If 
no other reasons militated against the advance, the 
advantage of a pledge to satisfy damages which our 
citizens may sustain during the present violence, is 
considerable, and will not, I presume, be overlooked.

I am, &c.,
