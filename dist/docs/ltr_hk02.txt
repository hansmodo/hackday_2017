for another. We are very busy with the Pears [?]. I am drying the windfalls and 
your father is picking and hauling off. He is having good luck selling getting 
$1.50 a box for most of them. We’ll go again tomorrow (Thursday) with 12 boxes 
which are ordered. The merchants do not buy freely on account of the sugar question. 
Last sat. your cousin Sam came walking in and said he represented the Govt. “How 
much sugar you got?” He did not fool me a second. My I was glad to see him. Stayed 
all day and all night. He will soon establish himself somewhere on the coast. 
All the family except Hollis [?] are located in or near Denver at the present 
time. The loads of [unintelligible] and [unintelligible] are going by here at 
a [unintelligible] rate every day. Your father is having pretty good luck selling 
the hay and he is in a hurry for we are likely to have early rains. Sunday 18th 
Your [unintelligible] carpenter Bereton just called to say howdy do. I said to 
him - They haven’t got you yet. No but they got the German Charley. I asked him 
why he’s not over there doing his part he said he was too old which I do not believe. 
Pa is picking up pears - said he would be glad when it was done for he is very 
tired. Will not go around with any more. Has sold to Mr. Stowell and will deliver 
on Mr. Price’s place which will be much easier for him. Tuesday 20th Pa finished 
[unintelligible] gathering pears today and will need a rest. Do not know what 
the returns will be. Mr. Cooley came down [unintelligible] a small quantity today. 
They are very nice dried before [unintelligible] will be [unintelligible] [unintelligible]
