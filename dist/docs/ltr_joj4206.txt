Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your letter of the 8th ultimo, and a subsequent one not dated. Your Dictionary will doubtless 
derive utility and reputation from the extensive investigations you mention. The assiduity with which yon have for 
many years persevered, and still persevere, in accomplishing that arduous task, will, I hope, be followed by results, 
not only beneficial to the public, but also to yourself. 
There are gentlemen in this country by whom, I presume, judicious criticisms and friendly offices would be 
readily afforded. In case a further revision should be 
undertaken with zeal and good-will, at <a href='/results.php?city=oxford' rel='city'>Oxford</a> or <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, and terminate with explicit commendation, it would 
excite attention both in Britain and America, and produce 
useful consequences. 
</p><p>
To whatever persons the perusal of the manuscripts may 
be committed, permit me to hint that they should be very 
legible. This remark is sucrsrested bv the recollection of an 
incident which occurred many years since. The author of 
a large manuscript, written in an indistinct hand, requested 
a certain gentleman to favour him with his opinion of it. 
The gentleman, after a while, returned it, with some polite 
general observations of little importance. It seems he 
" had neither time nor patience to decipher much of it." 
</p><p>
Should circumstances occur to render it highly probable 
that your attending a revision in England would eventually 
promote sales in both countries, or ensure a good price for 
the copy, the expense incurred by it might be more than 
compensated. As several years are still necessary to 
finish the work, and as occurrences may in the mean time 
create objections or afford facilities which cannot now be 
foreseen, the question, what posterior measures would be 
advisable, may probably be more easily answered at a future 
day than at present. 
</p><p>
Your intention to favour me with a visit next summer 
gives me pleasure. Whether our lives will be prolonged 
to that period, depends on that good <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> on which 
you happily and wisely rely, and whose beneficence I hope 
you will continue to experience. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, 
Your friend and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
