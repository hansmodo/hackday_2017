Though few are the days passed since you left me, my dearest <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="sibling met">Anna</a>, they have 
been spent in anxious impatience to hear from you. Your letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> relieved my mind, and the one from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> this hour received gives me the 
greatest pleasure. To trace you and your dear husband in that regretted city, where 
we have spent our early years, to find that even there you can recollect with affection 
the solitary being you have left behind, reflects a ray of brightness on my sombre 
prospects. I will now give you a little sketch of our times here. I shut myself 
up from the time you entered the stage until Saturday, when we went to drive in 
the rain with Marshall Brent. All our acquaintance called in to see me on the different mornings. Those few whom I saw 
seemed to sympathize with me in your loss ! ! ! I drank tea with the Fingeys and 
Mrs. Forest, the amount of visits accomplished. A letter from the President announces the death of poor Maria, and the 
consequent misery it has occasioned them all. This is among the many proofs, my 
dear sister, of the uncertainty of life. A girl so young, so lovely! All the efforts 
of friends and doctors availed nothing. I am delighted with the kind attention you 
meet from our old acquaintance, and have no doubt but that you will have a grateful 
welcome in all the places you are destined to visit. Remember me to the McKeans, 
and to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=smy" rel="friend met">Sally</a> say a great deal, for I feel a tenderness for her and her husband, independent of circumstances.

Your devoted sister, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=dol" rel="me">DOLLY </a>.
