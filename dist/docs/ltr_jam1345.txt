DEAR SIR: I received your letter of November 13 some time past, and 
should have answered it sooner but for the great pressure of business on me, 
proceeding from duties connected with the measures of Congress. 
</p><p>
step suggested is mine to you of October 20 will, I am inclined to 
believe, be unnecessary. My sole object in it was to enable you to place 
your view of the authority under which you acted in Florida on the strongest ground possible, so as to do complete justice to yourself. I was persuaded that you had not done yourself justice in that respect, in your correspondence with the Department, 
and thought that it would be better that the explanation should commence with you, than be invited by the Department. 
It appeared to me that that would be the most delicate course in regard to 
yourself. There is, it is true, nothing in the Department to indicate a difference of opinion between you and the Executive, respecting the import of 
your instructions, and for that reason, that it would have been difficult to 
have expressed that sentiment without implying by it a censure on. your conduct, than which nothing could be more remote from our disposition or intention. 
</p><p>
On reviewing your communication by Captain Gadsden, there were three 
objects pre-eminently in view: the first, to preserve the Constitution from
injury; the second, to deprive Spain and the allied powers of any just cause 
of war; and the third, to improve the occurrence to the best advantage to 
the country, and of the honor of those engaged in it. In every step which I 
have since taken, I have pursued those objects with the utmost zeal, and 
according to my best judgment. In what concerns you personally, I have, 
omitted nothing in my power to do you justice, nor shall I in the sequel. 
</p><p>
The decision in the three greatpoints above stated, respecting the course to 
be pursued by the administration, was unanimously concurred in; and I 
have good reason to believe that it has been maintained since, in every particular, by all, with perfect integrity. It wiH be gratifying to you to know 
that a letter of instructions has been drawn by the Secretary of State to our 
Minister-at Madrid, in reply to a letter of Mr. Pizzaro, which has been published, in which all the proceedings in Florida, and in regard to it, have 
been freely reviewed, and placed in a light which will, I think, be satisfactory to all. This letter will be reported to Congress in a few days, and 
published of course. 
</p><p>
On one circumstance it seems proper that I should now give you an explanation. Your letter of January 6 was received while I was seriously 
indisposed. Observing that it was from you, I handed it to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> to 
read, after reading one or two lines, only, myself. The order to you to 
take the command in that quarter had before then been issued. He remarked, after perusing the letter, that it was a confidential one, relating to 
Florida, which I must answer. I asked him if he had forwarded to you the 
orders of Gen. Gaines on that subject. He replied that he had. Your letter to me, with many others from friends, was put aside, in consequence of 
my indisposition and the great pressure on me at the time, and never recurred to until after my return from London, on the receipt of yours by 
Mr. H^nbly, and then on the suggestion of Mr. Calhoun.
