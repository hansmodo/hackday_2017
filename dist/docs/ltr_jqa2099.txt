SIR : 
</p><p>
I return to the conversation of which it was my purpose to give you the relation. The first point started was that 
of alienage, residence, and domicility, which recurs in various forms in many of the cases now in the courts. Lord Grenville said that a statement was 
preparing taking up the subject in all its different points of view, which might lead to a settlement of the principles on which an agreement may be 
made, in which case a retrospective operation may be given to it so far as will be practicable, to guide the decisions in the 
causes now pending that involve the question ; and he said he would send me this statement in the course of a few days for consideration. 
</p><p>
The questions relative to the trade in American vessels 
with the French West India Islands, and from them to France 
and to other parts of Europe, were then noticed. He said 
that the Lords of Appeal had been and were still sincerely 
desirous to avoid the necessity of establishing any new principles of decision that might bear the appearance of harshness towards neutral trade ; but had uniformly endeavored 
to govern their decrees conformably to rules practised upon 
in the course of former wars. That a trade opened by an 
enemy in favor of neutral navigation, flagrante bello, and 
contrary to the permanent system pursued by that enemy 
in time of peace, had, therefore, been viewed as inadmissible ; 
as a mere evasion for the purpose of giving protection to 
hostile property, and so far as the principle of former decisions on this head would apply to the present cases, the 
Lords Commissioners would probably be governed by them. 
He then mentioned the case of the Dutch ships that occurred 
in the year 1758, and said he had a report concerning them 
made by persons of the highest judicial authority in this 
country, namely the late Lord Mansfield, Sir Dudley Ryder and Doctor Charles Hay. 
</p><p>
I observed that not having seen that report, I had not an 
opportunity to remark upon the doctrines it might contain; 
but with respect to the case of the Dutch ships, admitting 
in the first place that it was parallel to that of our trade on 
the present occasion, the Americans might inquire, whether 
that nation were satisfied with the determinations in the 
Admiralty Courts of this country, and cheerfully acquiesced 
in the principles upon which the proceedings here were founded. That if the fact was otherwise, and strong remonstrances were made by the Dutch government at that 
time against those proceedings, we might rather conclude 
it was not a point generally admitted as the settled law of 
nations. That the opinions of the British lawyers and judges 
in such an instance, however respectable, could be allowed as 
authorities only so far as they might show the opinion of a 
single nation, of a nation that was a party in the question, 
and whose judgment would therefore be more liable to a 
scruple than it would be in the case of a principle, which 
should have had the sanction of similar opinions in other countries. 
</p><p>
He admitted in some measure the distinction, but said that 
the final acquiescence of the Dutch in the case alluded to 
appeared from the fact of its having produced no eventual 
difference between the two nations, and that as there was 
no common judge among sovereigns, every nation must con 
sider its own decisions as authorities. 
</p><p>
I then said that we thought there was a very material distinction between the two cases. That from such a knowledge as we had obtained of the transactions concerning the 
Dutch ships, we conceived the principle upon which they 
were held liable to condemnation, rested on the idea that 
they were adopted as French, for the purpose of covering 
French property, that they navigated by special licenses 
and were on no other ground admitted into the French colonies, insomuch that every Dutch vessel, not provided with 
such special license, was liable to the exclusions of the permanent French colonial system of that time, and on attempt 
ing to trade with the French colonies would have been subjected to the common condemnation of a prohibited 
commerce. That in our case, a general, permanent and unlimited decree, proceeding from the supreme authority of 
the French nation, had permitted our intercourse with their colonies : that our merchants had in consequence pursued 
the trade upon their own capitals, on their own account and risk, and there could, therefore, not be the same ground for 
presuming the sole intention of covering the property of parties to the war. 
</p><p>
He said that the general nature of the decree would not in 
his opinion create a material difference, if as seemed evident 
from its date, it was adopted with an immediate view of the 
state of war into which the nation had just entered, and in 
tended manifestly to obviate the distress which that state 
would naturally produce: "but I presume (he added) that 
the counsel for the American claims involving these questions will be instructed to urge this distinction before the 
Lords of Appeal " : and on my answering that they doubtless 
would be, he said, that if it was found to be just, he believed 
it would have its proper weight on the minds of the Commissioners. 
</p><p>
The question as to the extent of places besieged or blockaded was noticed, but not much dwelt upon. I stated our 
idea that it is by the law of nations limited to such places as 
may be surrounded in such a manner as to prevent the introduction of all supplies. He doubted whether the principle 
could be admitted in such a latitude, but appeared to be of 
opinion, that there would be no occasion at least for an immediate discussion of this article. 
</p><p>
A decision had already taken place at the last session of 
the Commissioners concerning property shipped in American names, but previously contracted for as French property 
and to become such at the moment of landing. The property was condemned, and, indeed, Lord Grenville appeared 
to think there was very little weight in the arguments I 
urged in support of claims resting on that foundation. I 
said that even by the common law, a transfer of property was 
held to be completed only by the delivery of the article, and 
that where the shipment is on neutral account and risk, the 
loss in case of capture must fall upon the neutral owner 
too : but he said that in such circumstances the intention 
to cover the property appears so manifest, that he believed 
no impartial arbitrator would think it entitled to protection. 
I had been informed by Mr. Bayard that in one of the late 
causes, a question had been started by one of the Lords Commissioners, whether potash is not to be considered in future 
as an article of contraband. I told his lordship that I felt 
it incumbent to take the earliest moment to be explicit on 
this subject. That the article was so important in the list 
of exports from the United States, that their interest would 
be most essentially injured by the assumption of such a principle, and I could see no possible ground upon which the pre 
tension could be raised. He said that the occasion from 
whence the question arose was known to me : it was the use 
that had recently been made of this article for the fabrication of gunpowder. That the principle upon which all the 
modern treaties had defined the specific articles to be held as 
contraband, was the use which may be made of such materials for the purposes of war. That saltpetre itself had not 
been in the class of contraband before the use of gunpowder 
was discovered, and that it was perfectly equitable and con 
formable to the law of nations, that if in process of time any 
article should be made subservient to warlike employment 
which has not been previously thus used, it should be considered as having lost its character of innocence, and be involved in the proscription of contraband. I replied that if 
it be even admitted, then an article unquestionably free 
may by a new application of it to warlike uses assume the 
dubious character of a mixed article, that could not surely 
authorize a single nation, without the concurrent assent of 
others, to place it upon the list of contraband : and having 
said thus much I should only add, that his Lordship had 
signed the treaty long after the new use of potash in France 
had been made and was universally notorious ; and yet it 
was not mentioned in the treaty among the contraband 
articles. He said this last observation was certainly conclusive as far as relates to the United States. 
</p><p>
One more observation relative to the Lords of Appeal will 
conclude the topics embraced in this conversation on their 
subject. I said that these claims had become an object so 
highly interesting to the people of the United States, that I 
could have wished they might have fairly laid before them the 
special point of every decision, particularly of those which 
might be unexpected to them, or variant from their interests. 
In such a case, if it were shown to their conviction, that the determination was supported by the admitted laws of nations, I had not a doubt but they would freely and cheer 
fully acquiesce. That I could not, therefore, but regret 
that the decrees of the Commissioners were frequently 
founded upon the special circumstances of the case, because 
the point of decision is thereby left uncertain, and we have 
no opportunity to discuss it, or to receive proper satis 
faction of its justice. He admitted that it was desirable the 
point should appear as much as possible, but said that in 
these cases the law, the fact and the evidence were so blended, 
and became often so necessarily complicated, as made it impossible to reduce the determination to any single point, or 
to form it otherwise than upon the special circumstances of the case. 
</p><p>
He afterwards mentioned the proposed agreement for 
the settlement of the minor cases by an arbitration. But I 
think best to leave this matter in its present state until Mr. Pinckney returns. Mr. Bayard states the original idea to 
have been of a sort of compromise, and between that and an 
arbitration to which Lord Grenville pertinaciously adheres, 
the difference is too great for me to give my assent to the 
alteration without instructions for my warrant. As Mr. Pinckney will be here in the course of a week or ten days at 
farthest, this delay can operate no material injury. 
</p><p>
I repeated the request for a written minute of the agreement we had come to, concerning the pay of the Commissioners, and was told it should certainly be sent me shortly. 
</p><p>
It is perhaps unnecessary for me to add many observations upon the substance of the above-related conversation. But as the mere statement may possibly have a 
tendency to raise expectations which may not be realized, 
I find myself obliged to say, that I have not the confidence 
in the general policy of this cabinet, or in the particular dispositions of any one member of it, that would lead me to any 
strong reliance upon mere verbal declarations : much less 
that would permit me to draw any inferences from them. 
The manner of Lord Grenville at this time was as apparently 
candid and favorable as the substance of what he said ; but 
the effects alone are the proper grounds of dependence. If 
it be true that the Lords of Appeal will not extend any unfriendly principle beyond the clear doctrines of former precedent ; if it be true that the manifest distinction between 
our West India trade during this war, and the case of the Dutch ships in 1758 will have its proper weight on their 
minds ; if it be true that there will be no occasion to discuss the question as to the extent of places besieged or blockaded, 
we may expect a much more liberal measure of justice from the decrees in which these points will be involved, than my 
belief will warrant. As to the doubt raised upon the nature 
of potash, the treaty certainly disposes of that, and indeed if 
it did not, the pretension of adding to the list of contraband 
by the authority of this nation alone is so absurd, that in any 
other than a British maritime court, I cannot conceive it 
would be seriously made. 
</p><p>
As to the question of the domicile, nothing has yet been 
said upon which a conclusion might fairly be drawn. A can 
did disposition to agree upon the subject in an equitable 
manner is professed, and as it is reserved for further discussion it will of course be noticed in future communications. 
I have the honor &c.
