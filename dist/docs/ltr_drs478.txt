   Old friend -- It is
very seldom that I have to apologize for any failure in punctuality in answering correspondents,
but have not been as punctual as
usual in answering your last,
(forwarded to me to Camp Chase
at Columbus) from the fact th
we have never known until now
how long we would remain in
Camp or where we would be
ordered to.
</p><p>
   You will perceive by this time
that I am again in the service of Uncle Sam. I have been
soldiering since the fifth of Nov.
I resigned my situation in
Darke Co. and quit the business
of teaching the young idea
how to shoot, in order
to learn how to shoot (secessionists)
myself. O Lord! what men
will do for glory, beans, bacon
and $17 per month! I am
writing this on the soldier's
writing desk, i.e. a board 18
inches square placed upon my
knees.
</p><p>
   We are provided with very
good quarters here -- regular
barracks -- and plenty of beans, bacon, hominy, and other luxuries.
but alas! how fleeting is all
earthly happiness! We are ordered to leave next week for Virginia, and ere this reaches you
we will be in "Dixie's Land."
</p><p>
   The only thing about the business I don't like is that it deprives us of the pleasure of that
time honored institution -- "sparking Sunday night." I haven't been
within 6 feet of a piece of calico for two months. Ugh! Think
of that old fellow, and the next
time you go to see your -- what's
her name? -- just give her a smack
on those rosy lips of hers for me.
Well, sir, the tattoo is beating and I
must attend roll call.
</p><p>
    As taps will beat in 20 minutes
and all lights must be extinguished
I must now close. My respects to
the friends and compliments to
the ladies -- especially your Angelia
Seraphina. Hope you will answer soon. My address
for a few weeks will be
