My Lord, 
</p><p>
The great questions which have agitated this country 
since my arrival, may now, I think, be considered as determined. I will therefore no longer postpone thanking your 
lordship for the letter which you did me the honour to 
write on the 11th May last, respecting which I shall omit 
saying any thing further by this opportunity. 
</p><p>
The treaty will go into operation, and be supported by a 
great majority of the people; a majority comprising the 
greater part of the men most distinguished by talents, 
worth, and weight. Strenuous endeavours were made and 
persisted in, to mislead the people by all the various means 
which art, unrestrained by principle, very readily devises. 
The English and Irish emigrants joined the opposition ; and 
what seems more singular is, that the French republicans 
and French refugees, so far forgot their animosities as to 
concur in resisting the restoration of good-will between 
Great Britain and the United States. 
</p><p>
Anxious that the present current of public opinion in 
favour of a paciiic and conciliatory system, may not be 
checked by fresh obstacles, permit me, my lord, to submit 
to your consideration the prudence, as well as justice of 
strong measures, to prevent, as far as possible, those very 
exceptionable impressments, and other severities, which too 
often occur. They may give occasion, and I am persuaded 
will continue to give occasion to more clamour than facts 
will justify ; but it is certainly true that much just cause for 
complaint does exist, and that there are persons here who 
would rejoice if there was much more. There is reason to 
believe, that certain individuals in the British service have 
been irritated, by the improper things said and published in 
this country, to indiscreet acts of resentment ; not considering, and probably not suspecting, that they were said and 
published for the purpose of provocation. It is to be wished, 
that they had recollected that these things were not said 
and published by our government, nor by those who desire 
to promote, and who do promote peace and harmony with 
Great Britain ; nor by those who are actuated by zeal for 
the honour and interest of their own country. 
</p><p>
We have aimed at, and laboured for the restoration of 
mutual justice and mutual good-will between our countries. 
The greatest difficulties are surmounted, and perseverance, 
with prudence and temper on both sides, will ensure success. Would not orders to discharge all impressed Americans, and enjoining a just and friendly conduct towards the 
people of this country, cherish their confidence, and manifest 
that disposition to conciliation, which repeated instances of 
violence and severity enable designing men (and with great 
appearance of reason) to draw into question ? Would not 
friendly assurances on these points to our government, tend 
greatly to impress the public with still more favourable 
opinions of the propriety and policy of their measures ; and 
consequently diminish the credit and influence of those who 
seize every occasion of impeaching their wisdom and your 
sincerity ? These men have, indeed, for the present missed 
their object, but they have not abandoned their designs. I 
mean the leaders, not the rank and file of the party. Among 
the latter are many misled, honest men, who, as they become undeceived, will act with propriety. 
</p><p>
Pardon, my lord, the liberty I take in these observations. 
I write freely because I confide fully in your candour, and 
because I flatter myself that you confide in mine. I have 
not leisure, at this moment, to be more particular. This 
letter will soon be followed by others. 
</p><p>
With great and sincere esteem and regard, I have the 
honour to be, my lord, 
</p><p>
Your lordship's most obedient 
</p><p>
And humble servant, 
</p><p>
