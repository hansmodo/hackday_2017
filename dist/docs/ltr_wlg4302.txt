Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I should have done myself the honor of writing to 
you sooner, if any thing had occurred at this place 
worth communicating. There has been a great dearth 
of foreign news, and, till within a short time, the representation has been so thin as to render it impracticable for Congress to undertake any matter of importance, although there are many which require their 
serious attention. Of late, there has been a tolerably 
full representation; but the time of Congress has been 
chiefly taken up with an investigation of the Connecticut cession of western territory. 
</p><p>
That State, some time ago, offered to cede all her 
claim to western territory within the following limits; â€” 
beginning one hundred and twenty miles westward 
of the Pennsylvania line, at the beginning of the 
forty-second degree, extending north as far as two 
minutes of the forty-third, w^est to the Mississippi, 
the meanders thereof the same breadth; east to the 
beginning, reserving out of this cession the one hundred and twenty miles between the ceded lands and 
the Pennsylvania line, with the jurisdiction of the 
same. This cession was at first much opposed, but 
Congress have at length agreed to accept it, whenever the Delegates of that State shall be authorized 
to make a proper deed ; the consequence of which 
is, I apprehend, a clear loss of about six millions of 
acres to the United States, which had been already 
ceded by Virginia and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ; for the Assembly 
of Connecticut, now sitting, will unquestionably open 
a Land-Office, and the Federal Constitution has not 
given a Court in this instance. 
</p><p>
The advocates for this measure urged, in favor of 
its adoption, that the claim of a powerful State, although unsupported hy right, was, under present circumstances, a disagreeable thing, and that sacrifices 
ought to be made for the public tranquillity, as well 
as to acquire an indisputable title to the residue ; 
that Connecticut would settle it immediately with 
emigrants well disposed to the Union, who would form 
a barrier not only against the British, but the Indian 
tribes upon the Wabash and Lake Michigan ; that the 
thick settlement they would immediately form, would 
enhance the value of the adjacent country, and facilitate emigrations thereto. 
</p><p>
Some alterations have been made lately in the 
land ordinance. The Surveyors are now allowed to 
survey by the magnetic meridian, and are limited to 
the territory lying southward of the east and west 
line, as described in the said ordinance ; the navigable waters and the carrying-places between them are 
made common highways, and forever free to the Atlantic States, as well as any new States that may 
be created, without any tax or impost therefor. An 
attempt was made to change the system altogether, 
but negatived. Indeed, the Eastern States, and some 
others, are so much attached to it, that I am satisfied no material alteration can ever be effected. The 
Geographer and Surveyors have directions to proceed 
without delay to carry the ordinance into execution, 
which, I presume, they will execute, provided the Indians will permit them, of which, however, I have 
very great doubts. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel=''>Mr. Adams</a> has informed Congress, by letters lately received, that he has made a demand of the posts, 
and has been refused. The Marquis of Carmarthen 
has given, as a reason for the refusal, that many of 
the States in the Union have violated the treaty with 
respect to the debts ; that the King of Great Britain 
will comply with his engagements, when the States 
shall show a disposition to perform their part of the 
contract respecting this matter. The States not included in the accusation are New Hampshire, Rhode 
Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Delaware. T 
beg leave to inform you, confidentially, that there does 
not appear, at present, the most distant prospect of 
forming a treaty either with Spain or Great Britain ; 
that the treaty with Portugal is in a proper train ; 
that peace can be procured with Tripoli and Tunis 
on reasonable terms, that is, for thirty-three thousand 
guineas each ; and probably with Morocco and Algiers 
for double that sum, respectively, if money can be 
loaned in Holland for that purpose. The late treaty 
with Algiers cost Spain one million three hundred 
thousand dollars. 
</p><p>
My compliments to Mrs. Washington ; and I remain, 
with the highest respect and esteem, &c.,
