I landed here at daylight this morning. The " Tempest " had passed here last evening, so here I must 
wait another opportunity. You perhaps remember 
this place at the mouth of the Ohio. There is an immense hotel and a few warehouses which were erected 
during the speculating mania of 35 and 36. They 
are now unoccupied and are sad monuments of that 
period of folly. The site of the town is overflowed in 
high water and in the hot season it is exceedingly 
sickly, bilious and intermittent fevers being prevalent. 
We stepped from our boat upon an old hull which has 
been moored here and fitted up as a house of enter 
tainment. It was a boat of the largest class and the 
magnificent cabin of one of the most expensive boats 
ever built on the Western waters has been transferred 
to it, the staterooms being used for sleeping apart 
ments, and the long range of saloons for drawing- 
rooms, dining-room, etc. It is well kept, no gambling 
or drinking being allowed on board; each one, how 
ever, is compelled to be his own servant, everything 
being exceedingly democratic. It is very hot and 
solitary, not a single boat being here this morning. 
The prospect outside is anything but inviting. The 
low grounds around are covered with rank, unwholesome-looking weeds, the river coated with a thick 
layer of yellow, slimy, putrid-looking ooze, the filth of 
the river Ohio for a hundred miles collected in the 
slack water at the mouth through which the catfish 
can scarcely squirm and upon which a light-footed 
lass might run, all lying under a burning sun unmoved by a breath of air. Over all reigns the stillness 
of a Sabbath morning unbroken by a sound save the 
screams of a dirty wench girl who is playing in the 
mud in the shadow of the boat with a pet bear. 
Imagine all this and you will have the scene which 
surrounds me and which I am doomed to enjoy the 
entire day. The only other guest the landlord has 
at this time is the captain of the steamer " Bulletin," 
waiting for a rise of water. He sits at present under 
the awning on the boiler deck intellectually employed with a long nine and an old newspaper. . . .
