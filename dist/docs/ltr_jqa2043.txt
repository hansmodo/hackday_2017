TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
</p><p>
No. [EDMUND RANDOLPH] 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, November 16, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1794">1794</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR : 
</p><p>
The Stadtholder returned to the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a> from Nimeguen 
four days since. On the I4th I had the honor of an audience 
from him and delivered my credentials, so that the forms of 
my reception at this Court are finished. 
</p><p>
I came yesterday from the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a> to this city, where I 
hope to have better means of obtaining information which 
may be worthy of communication than I could at that 
place. 
</p><p>
In my last letter I mentioned the peace said to have been 
made by the King of Prussia as a fact almost ascertained. 
Since that it has again become more questionable, and at 
present is even denied with great confidence. From various 
symptoms however I still venture to speak of it as an event which, if it has not yet already taken place, may be expected before spring. 
</p><p>
Nimeguen has met with the same fate as Maestricht, or 
rather with a worse, for it did not obtain a capitulation. 
The British troops in evacuating the place did not retrieve 
their character for good order and rigid discipline. 
</p><p>
By the capture of Maestricht an army of thirty-five 
thousand French troops is released to act elsewhere, and 
Breda and Gertruydenberg are said to be menaced. The 
whole number of the French troops who are now brought to 
bear upon this country is about ninety thousand men. Of the 
allies there are not more than thirty-five thousand to oppose 
them. I know not of any defensible fortress to balance this 
great inequality of numbers, and you can easily judge what 
the event probably will be under circumstances like these. 
</p><p>
The French troops I am just informed have already crossed 
the Waal, at Tiel. Nimeguen did capitulate. A gentle 
man just told me he saw the convention, consisting of three 
articles. That a continuance of their customary rights and 
privileges is stipulated for the inhabitants. The allied 
troops evacuated the town and crossed the river previous 
to the capitulation, leaving only 800 men behind, who could 
not get over the river, the floating bridge having been burnt. 
The troops that crossed were exceedingly harassed in their 
passage, and met with great loss from the fire of their enemy. 
The crisis of this country's fate is approaching with great 
rapidity and peace, if they can obtain it, is become of despotic 
necessity to them. 
</p><p>
Upon my arrival here last evening Mr. Bourne called on 
me, and told me he had just come from seeing General 
Eustace, who had in the morning been arrested and had his papers seized by order of the magistracy of this city, 
that he was confined to his chamber with a guard over 
him, and his papers had been sent to the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>. Nothing 
criminal had however been found among his papers, and he 
expected to be released as soon as an order should be obtained from thence. That the General had served in the 
French armies since the declaration of war between the two 
Republics, but, upon receiving the Proclamation of the 
President, declaring the neutrality of the United States, 
had immediately resigned his command and withdrawn from 
the service of France. 
</p><p>
This morning a gentleman of this city, a friend of General Eustace, called to see me, and requested me to interpose in 
such manner as I should think proper in behalf of that 
gentleman as a citizen of the United States. I told him that 
as one of my fellow citizens that General was entitled to all 
the good offices and assistance that I could render him, but 
that no representation on my part would probably be of 
any service to him, if he had forfeited his right to the privileges of the American neutrality by his engagements in the 
French service. That I would endeavor to obtain permission for access to him in his confinement, and would do every 
thing to serve him in my power, consistent with propriety 
and the obligation of my own duty. 
</p><p>
Mr. Visscher and the five other persons arrested for their 
concern in the remonstrance presented to the magistracy 
have been sentenced to six years hard labor in the common 
workhouse and perpetual banishment afterwards. The 
workhouse is the customary place to which common male 
factors are condemned. 
</p><p>
It is said that the severity of this punishment was owing to the representations of the British Ambassador, who 
insisted upon it as satisfaction for the reflections contained in the remonstrance against the British troops. 
</p><p>
November ij. I wrote a card this morning to the officer 
by whose command General Eustace was arrested, informing 
him that this gentleman had demanded the benefit of the 
treaties subsisting between this country and America, and 
requesting an order for access to him. The officer appointed 
this day at one o clock for the purpose. And when I went 
to the house according to the appointment I found he was 
already released, though his papers are not yet returned to 
him. They have apologized in some measure to him, and 
the Grand Bailiff of this city gave as an excuse to me that 
their suspicions had been grounded upon the General's having been so lately in the service of France. 
</p><p>
Upon conversing with him afterwards I find that he has 
never served in the French armies, since the war with this 
country, and is therefore fully entitled to all the protection 
that our treaties can afford him. He is irritated, as may 
naturally be expected, at the treatment he has received, 
and it is not improbable that you will hear from him upon 
the subject in America. 
</p><p>
I hear of an opportunity for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> which obliges 
me to conclude for the present with the assurance that I 
remain, with sentiments of invariable respect and consideration, Sir, your very humble and obedient servant.
