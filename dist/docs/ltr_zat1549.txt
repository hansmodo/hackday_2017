My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your acceptable letter of the 9th ins 1 was duly rec d for which you 
have my sincere thanks. The mail by the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">N. York</a> referred to by you, 
was duly rec d here, but brought nothing of interest ; the paper mail 
brought by her arrived here day before yesterday from which I have 
gleaned but little of moment. Two of the Gen officers referred to by 
you, who came over in the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">New York</a>, reached here several days since, to 
wit, Mess" Pillow 1 & Quitman, the latter a gentleman of intelligence, 
of large fortune long a Gen Officer of militia from the state of Mississippi ; the former a lawyer with much to learn as regards his new pro 
fession ; when they all arrive there will be too much rank I apprehend to 
get along with, very pleasantly. The wounded who have & may get 
pension certificates, I will direct the Q r Master at Fort Polk or Brasos 
Island, to give them every facility which can be done by the dep c to 
enable them to reach their homes, which I presume he would do without 
any direction or orders in regard to the same.

I was glad to hear that Dick had reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> in safety ; 
Gen Quitman informed me he left or saw him there, & that his health 
was much improved ; he also informed me that Gen Butler called at 
Baton Rouge to see Mrs Taylor, & that Betty was too unwell to leave 
her room, so that he did not see her. I got no letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> by 
the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">N. York</a>. Beatties 1 sickness accounts for it. This has given me 
much uneasiness ; & I shall be miserable until I hear from her. The 
Alabama I hope is in by this time, if so I trust I shall receive something 
by her to allay my apprehensions in regard to her situation. The 
recruits brought on by L l Blair with the exception of the sick were 
brought to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoros" rel="city">Matamoros</a> & distributed among the cop s of artillery for the 
the most part left at that place ; I flatter myself the sick will be taken 
care of some where. I hope you have accommodations sufficient by this 
time to accommodate all the sick which has or may be sent to Fort Polk, 
& will have them taken care of as far as it is possible to do so. The whole 
country will be filled with sick volunteers & in many instances without 
suitable accommodations, & I greatly fear many of them will suffer for 
want of many of the necessaries of life, as well as for medical advice 
all things considered there are a great scarcity of medical officers, in pro 
portion to the number of raw troops, when we take into consideration 
the climate &c ; besides which, many of the Medical Officers recently 
appointed & attached to the Volunteers to say the least of them are 
entirely without experience as regards their duties in the field ; but I 
hope those of the regular army will do all in their power to alleviate the 
sufferings of that portion they may have to do with, or can administer to, 
who may fall in their way, no matter where they belong. It is reported 
here that a part of the 2 d InfV had reached Brasos Island ; but how such 
a report originated or on what foundation made, I am unable to say ; but 
I hope it may be true.

Perhaps Anns views on the subject of your remaining here under 
the contingencies named, may be correct. If she was pleasantly located 
& satisfied with the same her views would be certainly correct, & may be 
so under existing circumstances.

I was never sanguine as to Johns rec& the app c in question, my 
experien in such matters has satisfied me that favors of that kind are only 
given to the faithful ; & if departed from, it is but seldom, & then under 
very peculiar circumstances. If the app f is not given John must turn 
his attention to something else ; at any rate after graduating at some of 
our respectable literary institutions ; he should not despond, but on the 
contrary redouble his exertions in such a way as to enable him to get 
through the world without the patronage of public or private individuals. 
I presume the party in power is indebted to D. J. Pearce 1 for some dis 
reputable transaction which Mr P. intends liquidating by giving his grand 
son an app at West point ; so we go. If seperated from your family, 
as you correctly say, were they satisfied with their position, it would be 
somewhat of a matter of indifference as to your position so it was healthy.

The go paper denies that the object of assembling twenty post 
Capt s at Washington was to consult & decide on the propriety of attack 
ing the castle of San Juan, near Very Cruz ; but that paper is doubtful 
authority, as I understand its Se r Editor says that England has never 
offered her mediations or good offices to bring about a reconciliation 
between the U. States & Mexico, while Sir R. Peel states distinctly in his 
able speech in parliament on retiring from office that she had done so. 
I fear there will be no end to this war in any reasonable time, & that it 
will be carried on with a view to conquest, with the expection if success 
ful it will secure Mr Polks reeliction, which in my mind will be the case 
in that event, so that I think it is now & will be carried on for that object 
& not so much to conquer a peace

I have commenced to-day throwing in advance toward <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> an 
other depot at a point 60 miles from here ; Gen Worth leaves today with

I Dutee Jerauld Pearce (1789-1849) was a native of Rhode Island and an eminent member of the Newport bar. He served 
many years in the state legislature, was attorney-general from 1819 to 1825, and was a member of the Federal house of representa 
tives from i8zgtoi849. He was a democrat in politics. 
about 1000 pack mules & some waggons with 160,000 rations for Surralvo to be escorted & protected until I can join him with eight Comp 
of artillery, the 8th  Infy & Duncans battery of artillery, as soon as the train 
returns which I expect will be in ten days, I hope to be ready to leave 
with what force I shall carry to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>, say about six thousand men, 
& if I meet no resistance at that place shall pass on to Saltillo, about 
seventy miles further in the interior which if I can reach & take possession 
of, I intend throwing up a strong field work, & if there is flour or Indian 
corn in the country will establish a large depot & bring forward as large 
a number of volunteers as can be supported there, & then act as in my 
judgement the best interest of the country may warrant. I apprehend 
great dissatisfaction on the part of the volunteers when I leave here as to 
those who are to remain behind, as they are all, the officers, anxious to 
go to lead as it were the advance, or the forlorn hope, at least so they 
say. But I may be disappointed by the Q r M. Dep the ordnance or 
medical dept as regards my leaving ; none of which are over efficient or 
rather their heads For the last three months I have be trying to get 
a supply of horse shoes & nails, & up to this moment not one has been 
furnished, nor can we possibly move without them as the road over 
which we have to march beyond this is covered with sharp rocks or stone 
and the day we commenced Fort Brown, the chief of the ordnance dep 
was directed to require a number of 12 pounders on traveling carriages, 
not one of which has reached their place of destination or even so far as 
I know have they been heard from.

The numerous Steam Boats on the river are doing but very little ; 
they are about twice as long in making their trips from the mouth of the 
river to this place as they should be, & when they get here have very 
little in them. It will be a long time before the volunteers get here the 
way they are going on. My love to dear Ann & the children when you 
write, as well as best respects to all inquiring friends & accept my sincere 
wishes for the continued health & prosperity of you & yours through life.
