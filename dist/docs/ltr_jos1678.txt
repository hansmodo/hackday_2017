My Dear Brother : Since my return home I have been 
constantly and often painfully engaged. I spoke at a 
general jubilee at Columbus on the day of Mr. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="colleague met">Lincoln's</a> 
assassination. This tragic event suspended business, and 
cast a general gloom over all things. . . . 
</p><p>
The universal topic of conversation and of discussion 
in the newspapers was your arrangement with Johnston, 
and it is fair to say it was generally disapproved. The 
stipulation to secure to the rebels their property was 
construed to mean slaves, an impossible condition after 
we had induced them to enter our service by promise of 
freedom. It was felt also that to give them the benefit 
of their state organizations with all their political power 
would be unjust to those who have been friendly to us, 
especially in the border States, and would inevitably lead 
to a renewal of the war. ^But while the arrangement 
was disapproved, the manner in which Stanton and Halleek treated it, and especially the gross and damnable 
perversions of many of the papers and their arraignment 
of your motives, was more severely condemned than 
your arrangement. The conduct of Grant is deserving 
of the highest praise. I shall always feel grateful to 
him. What you were reported to have said about the 
effect of a single mistake proved literally true. For a 
time, you lost all the popularity gainedNbj" your achievements. But now the reaction has commenced, and you 
find some defenders, but many more to denounce the 
base and malicious conduct of a gang of envious scamps, 
who seized upon this matter as a pretext for calumny. 
What to make of Stanton, I don't know. I w,as beyond 
measure surprised at his conduct. He telegraphs me 
that he has written me in full. I still think he only 
gave away to passion, and not to envy or malice. If you 
have time, I hope to have some explanation from you. 
I suppose the war is about over, and you will, I trust, 
come to Ohio.

Affectionately,
