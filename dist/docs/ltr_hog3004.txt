SIR, 
</p><p>
Monday morning, between eight and nine o clock, our advanced 
guard-boat, down the Lake, made the signal for the approach of 
the enemy's fleet. In about one hour, five of their largest boats 
or gondolas appeared in sight, and a number of troops, Indians, 
and Canadians, were seen landing upon Three-Mile Point. Soon 
after, two of the armed boats stood over to the east side of the 
Lake, inclining upwards, as if sent to reconnoitre. When they 
came considerably within shot, they were fired upon from two 
redoubts very near the shore, and by a row-galley which is stationed to cover the boom. They thereupon retired. In the mean 
time, the enemy's troops were distinctly seen to land upon 
the back of the Point; and, presently after, thirteen small bateaux and birch canoes crossed from the west to the east side of 
the Lake into a bay, about four miles below our redoubts. 
</p><p>
Upon these threatenings of an attack, our lines, redoubts, and 
posts were all manned ; and as the motions of the enemy seemed 
to indicate they were gathering their main force upon the west 
side of the Lake, as if intending to make their push there, I 
ordered three regiments (Poor s, Bead s, and Greaton s) from 
Mount Independence, to reenforce this side. The orders were 
instantly obeyed, and nothing could exceed the spirit and alertness which were shown by all officers and soldiers in executing 
every order that was given. About four, in the evening, the 
boats and canoes that had passed to the west side of the Lake 
returned, and the enemy were seen plainly to reembark at the 
Three-Mile Point. I immediately ordered the guard-boat to resume her station ; and, by sunset, it was observed the body of 
the enemy had retired. 
</p><p>
By the information I receive daily, I find that General Carleton continues in his post, and that three large vessels are anchored near Putnam's Point; a little below which, all the light 
infantry, grenadiers, and a large body of Indians and Canadians, 
are encamped. Chimney Point and Crown Point are also occupied by the enemy. Yesterday I received the inclosed intelligence from Newbury, Coos.

If Sir John Johnson did actually march at the time he is said 
to have done it, he must be upon the Mohawk River now; or, if he aims at Fort George, Dayton's regiment cannot be better 
stationed then there. Surely, your Oneidas will give you all the 
necessary information upon this head. But how could Sir John 
get back, if he should meet with a check ? I have seen the Mohawk River fast frozen on the 10th of November. 
</p><p>
Colonel Lewis set off yesterday morning by Skene. He has 
memorandums of our wants, and will be with you as soon as 
this letter. Colonel Gansevoort writes me for spades. You must 
answer his demand, for I cannot.

We received the good news you sent us from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> with 
joyful hearts. It was immediately made public to the army, in the manner you advised. I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant,
