I dispatched a missive to you this morning just be 
fore we marched from Tepeyahualco which we left 
at eight in the morning. We moved with the Dragoons 
under Thornton in advance, then Duncan s light 
battery, then Smith s light battalion, of which I am 
acting major, not a " real live " major, not even a 
brevet, then the Second Artillery, then the Third 
under Bel ton l (who by the bye expresses much in 
terest in your welfare), then the wagon train, and 
finally the Fourth Infantry as a rear guard. Our 
route lay through the same arid plain which I have 
already described. Orizaba s silver crest on our left 
shone in the morning sun like a metallic dome to some 
huge cathedral, while Popocatepetl just showed his 
snowy summit over the lower mountains in our advance, resembling a white cloud on the far distant 
horizon. As the sun approached the zenith it became 
intensely hot. We, however, marched with great deliberation and by one o clock encamped in order of 
battle at this place, having made twelve miles.

This is nothing but an extensive hacienda where 
besides the proprietor s house and a large enclosure 
with the peons huts there is a chapel and a fine well. 
Wells on this great Mexican plateau are property as 
they were in the patriarchal days of Abraham.

I am now for the first time since the beginning of 
the war about to advance the opinion that we are on 
the verge of a peace. As I have been hitherto correct 
in my prognostics, I trust my " second sight " will 
not prove erroneous now. My reasons for advancing 
this opinion are numerous. This morning the diligence (the aforesaid Troy stage) entered the town of 
Tepeyahualco before we left. It was direct from the 
City of Mexico, the first arrival from that place since 
the battle of Cerro Gordo. In it were one English 
and three Mexican gentlemen, who stated that the 
peace party under Rejou and Gomez Farrias was fast 
gaining strength; that both at Puebla and Mexico 
the inhabitants were anxious for our presence to protect them from their own banditti who were robbing 
the defenceless; that the church and people were 
now convinced that we outside barbarians had not 
come here to dismember the state or destroy their 
religion; and that the unconditional release of the 
prisoners taken at Cerro Gordo and their being furnished with provisions to support them to their homes 
had produced such a wonderful effect upon the remainder of the army that their generals had been 
obliged to embody them and send them under guards 
to their villages, for fear that their statements would 
cause the residue of their troops already disaffected 
to entirely disband. I see no reason to doubt their 
assertions and I now believe that in two months 
negotiations for peace will have commenced. . . .

May 12, El Penal. We marched on the tenth as 
usual passing several haciendas. Our route lay through 
a country very similar to that which I have already 
described. The same bold mountain peaks in every 
direction bounding the same extensive level plain the 
great Mexican plateau. The character of the soil improved and the cultivated fields were more numerous 
and extensive. About two in the afternoon we passed a 
beautiful spot, Ojo de Agua. This extensive hacienda 
lay at the foot of a bold mountain. Besides the usual 
residence of the wealthy proprietor, who was there to 
welcome us, there were many neat, stone houses for 
the peons, arranged in parallel streets like the negro 
quarters on a large Louisiana plantation, and a beautiful little chapel with an ornamented dome and two 
steeples for bells, having in front of it an exquisite 
garden filled with rare tropical flowers in full bloom. 
I gathered a large bouquet which I only wish I could 
place in your hand. We marched two or three miles 
from Ojo in a gale of wind, so completely filling the 
air with dust that we could not see a rod before us. 
We encamped in a corn field, the young corn just 
above the ground, at some nameless hacienda. This 
morning at daylight the Second Brigade of our 
division under Colonel Clarke overtook us, and we 
all marched at six in the morning. We found the 
character of the country much changed. On both 
sides of the road, the plain to the base of the mountains and in some instances far up their sides was well 
cultivated and in every direction lying in the midst 
of the rich corn and barley fields were haciendas and 
towns. Some pear, peach, and apple trees grew along 
the road and an occasional grove of pines and locusts. 
Among the more useful productions of the soil is the 
aloe or century plant, from which is made the pulque, 
the universal drink of the Mexicans. The fields 
are divided by long hedges of it. We arrived at the 
town of Nopalucam at half-past ten, an ordinary 
Mexican town. The padre more sensible than most 
of his brethren kept all his people at home instead of 
suffering them to flee before us " barbarians." 
</p><p>
We have heard that Santa Anna is in our advance 
a few leagues with a considerable force. When we 
get there if he has not fled we will give him another 
edition of Cerro Gordo. We encamped at two o clock 
about twenty-two miles from Puebla. The wind 
blows so I cannot write any more; this bivouacking 
is ridiculous business. 
</p><p>
May ij. During the night we had an alarm, several 
shots were fired by our pickets and the long roll beat. 
We were all under arms at two o clock, and remained 
so till daylight, when our battalion with a squadron 
of Dragoons and two engineers with the sappers and 
miners were sent in advance to search for some 
fougasses which it was reported the enemy had made 
under the road. After advancing about two miles, 
the road winding along the base of the mountain, we 
reached the famous pass of El Penal. Here the valley 
between two mountains is narrow, the ground gullied 
and broken and a broad, deep ravine whose sides are 
perpendicular and twenty or thirty feet high confines 
the narrow road to the immediate base of the mountain, which is precipitous and ragged with ledges and 
broken rocks, sustaining, wherever the crevices afford 
sufficient soil, large pine trees, hence the name. Here 
the engineers found that the Mexicans had commenced 
establishing mines under the road by constructing 
galleries from the ravine but they were abandoned 
incomplete. Information was sent back to the 
general and after advancing about a mile farther we 
halted for the main body to come up. It overtook 
us at seven in the morning and an hour after we 
resumed our usual order of march. 
</p><p>
We soon entered the small town of Acajete where 
we halted again for an hour. Here we were told that 
Santa Anna had retreated from Puebla, and that 
there had been a Pronunciamento against him in 
Mexico. After passing Acajete the road leaves the 
mountains, although they are still visible in every 
direction, and passes through a cultivated plain 
sprinkled with small villages and haciendas. At one 
place for at least a mile it is cut down into the 
soil ten feet resembling the deep cutting for a rail 
road. 
</p><p>
About one o clock we entered Amazoque which is 
a considerable town with a large plaza, several fine 
churches, and some extensive barracks for Dragoons 
and Infantry. The inhabitants were not at all alarmed 
at our approach the streets were crowded as they 
would be in the United States on a training day, the 
women and men mingling freely among our ranks as 
we halted in the plaza; the hucksters and market 
women were all about us hawking their various articles 
of trade. There was a great variety of fruits there, 
pines, oranges, mama apples, cocoanuts, ripe cherries, 
raspberries, and peaches. We soon got into quarters, 
such as they were, with the expectation of resting 
here over tomorrow waiting for General Quitman s 
Brigade one day behind us. 
</p><p>
May 14. The morning broke most delightfully, as 
it ever does in this delicious climate, and although I 
had been quite sick in the night, I dressed in my best, 
intending to take a look at the nut-brown dames of 
Amazoque, when a sudden change came over the 
scene. The long roll sounded, a call which always 
thrills to the very marrow of a soldier, as it never 
beats on light occasions and is the usual prelude to a 
battle. Amid all the confusion it was impossible for 
some time to ascertain the cause of the alarm. We 
soon learned that a large force was advancing from 
the direction of Puebla. Our little battalion was kept 
in the square as a part of the reserve, while a portion 
of the artillery and the main Infantry force marched 
out to meet the foe who were moving round the right 
of the town, apparently to get in our rear. Our cannon 
soon opened upon them, throwing them into great 
confusion. By this time, about nine o clock, we as 
certained that their force was only about twenty-five 
hundred cavalry with three pieces of artillery. They 
did not attempt to return our fire but marched in 
considerable confusion to our right and rear. As they 
approached Quitman s Brigade, which warned by our 
guns was drawn up in order of battle, they retreated 
still farther to the right, and thus ended the battle of 
Amazoque. With no loss on our side we took some 
five or six prisoners, including their chaplain and a 
lieutenant, and eight cavalry horses. The number of 
their killed is variously estimated from twenty to fifty. 
Their forces were led by Santa Anna in person, but 
no one can devise what could have been the object of 
his movement.
