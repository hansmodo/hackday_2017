Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
He will be nominated and I hope elected. So shall I ; 
and it is better for the country that, in our relative positions, we are independent of each other. I hope you 
and he will preserve your ancient cordiality ; for though 
he seems willing to strip your office of its power, yet I 
have no doubt he feels as warm an attachment for you 
as, from his temperament, he can to any one. You have 
been forbearing with him, but lose nothing by it. I 
have seen nothing in the course of the ^Republican party 
unfriendly to you. I know you have hosts of friends 
in our party who would resent any marked injustice 
to you. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours,
