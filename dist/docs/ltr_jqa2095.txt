</p><p>
I saw yesterday Lord Grenville at his office, and had a 
lengthy conversation with him upon subjects connected with 
the object of my mission here, and upon those concerning 
which your instructions had previously been executed by Mr. Deas. 
</p><p>
I found Sir William Scott, the Advocate General, with 
him. The point first discussed was that concerning the cases 
proposed to be settled by compromise. This matter being, 
however, still unsettled I shall reserve for a separate letter 
an account of whatever relates to it. 
</p><p>
The Advocate General having withdrawn, the compensation to the Commissioners was mentioned, and I told his 
Lordship that upon further reflection I had been confirmed 
in the opinion that my authority from the American government would not permit me to make any discrimination in 
the pay of the several members of the same Commission. 
That wishing, however, to be candid with him, I should 
acknowledge that my instructions allowed me to agree to the 
sum of 150x3 to the Commissioners for the debts and for 
the spoliations, and 1000 for those who are to determine the 
river St. Croix ; and that rather than incur the delay necessary for taking the opinion of the American government, I 
should consent to those sums, though, at the same time, I 
must repeat that smaller sums would be preferred by them. 
He said that the principal object with him for thinking 1500 
necessary was, that he might propose it to the persons whom 
he had in his mind to send to America, and who would not 
go for less. That if I pleased, therefore, the agreement 
might be as he had before proposed to me, reserving to the 
American government the right to change it, if they thought 
proper, so far as to make the pay for all the same. I said 
once more that I had no authority to admit for a moment the 
idea of discrimination, but that as the reason he had mentioned for making it appeared weighty to my own mind, if 
he pleased the agreement should be such that the largest 
sums mentioned should be allowed to all the Commissioners 
alike, reserving to the American government the right to 
reduce, if they think proper, to 1000 the pay of those Commissioners who shall be in both instances not obliged to 
go beyond sea for the performance of their service. To 
this he agreed, requesting me until the determination of the 
American government be known not to mention the circumstance here, because he did not wish the future Commissioners here should be led to expect so much as 1500. I 
told him I should certainly be silent on the subject, and mentioned the propriety of having something written upon 
the agreement. He said he would in the course of a few days write me a note mentioning the agreement as it has been made in our conversation. 
</p><p>
I then observed there was a subject concerning which I 
had no instructions, nor indeed any communications, from 
the Government of the United States, but concerning which 
I had reason to believe the sensations in America were so 
strong that I felt myself bound in duty to suggest them, as 
indeed I had been required to do by the agent of American 
claims, who had received the sentiments of our government on the subject. That I understood there were several 
cases now pending before the Lords Commissioners of Appeals which involved in their decision certain points of national concern, upon which I should be happy to have some 
conversation with him, and that a decision had taken place 
during the course of the last summer which I believed, when 
made known in America, had occasioned disappointment 
and chagrin: that the ground upon which I had understood 
the condemnation had taken place, was the transient residence of one of the parties in the island of Guadeloupe; that 
there were indeed other incidental points, which I had been, 
however, informed had been given up or not insisted on upon 
the appeal, but that on the facts of the case as they were 
known to the American government, there was no legal principle upon which they conceived that property liable to condemnation ; that upon the occasion of the trial of that case, 
one point had arisen, upon which, if I was rightly informed, 
one of the Lords Commissioners had observed that some 
understanding between the two countries might be advisable, and that my own wish to prevent the irritation that 
must be occasioned by decisions so unfavorable to the interests, and so adverse to the opinions of my country, induced 
me to desire every possible occasion to discuss the points 
upon which a difference of opinion between the two nations 
might subsist. He said that he would cheerfully enter upon 
any such discussion ; that the government of this country 
never interfered in judicial proceedings to influence the decisions ; but that there might be agreements upon such or 
such principle of the laws of nations, which agreements would be considered as rules to guide the decrees. 
</p><p>
Several of these points upon which interesting questions 
now depend were mentioned, but not much dwelt upon. I 
thought it sufficient at this time to introduce the subject, 
which may be a very extensive one, and which is totally disconnected with any instructions that I have hitherto received. 
</p><p>
I then came to points upon which I had been honored 
with your orders and said that the instructions of the American government relative to the further matters which I 
should submit to his consideration, having been executed 
already by Mr. Deas, it was perhaps less necessary for me to 
enter largely upon the business than it might otherwise 
have been ; but that as these concerns had now devolved 
upon me, I thought it essential to the discharge of my duty 
to notice what had been specially recommended to my attention. That the President of the United States had been 
informed of numerous captures having been made, during 
the course of the last summer, of American vessels laden 
with provisions, in consequence of an order said to have been 
issued under his Majesty's authority, and I was directed to 
inquire into the existence of such an order. He said that he 
would direct Mr. Hammond in the course of a very few days 
to send me a copy of that order ; that a copy of it had been 
sent, to be communicated to the American government in America with suitable explanations, but that the manner 
in which Mr. Deas had thought proper to execute his instructions was such that he (Lord Grenville) chose to have 
no communication with him on the subject. He then added 
that the treaty admitted by implication that there are cases 
in which provisions and other articles not generally contra 
band may become so, and stipulated that until the two countries should agree on this subject their respective conduct 
towards each other shall be regulated by the existing law of 
nations ; that he believed there was not a single writer upon 
the law of nations who did not lay down the principle that 
provisions may become contraband, and that the known 
passage of Vattel, a modern and judicious writer, who upon 
the subject of national law had taken the indulgent side, and 
might be considered as a protestant of political doctrines, 
expressly stated that provisions may be liable to capture 
with indemnity, when the distress of the enemy is such for 
want of them that it becomes a mean of reducing them, or 
of procuring an advantageous peace ; that, besides, it is 
equally clear that vessels may be detained upon suspicion 
of their having on board property belonging to the enemy of 
the captor, by the treaty and by the existing law of nations. 
Now, the order only directs a capture when both the circumstances concur; that is, when the vessels are laden with 
provisions, and when there is any suspicion of enemy's property. It does not, therefore, go to the extent that it might without any violation of right. 
</p><p>
"With respect to the treaty (said I) my instructions expressly command me to say that its ratification must not be 
construed into an admission of the legality of this order. As 
to the principle stated by your Lordship as being laid down 
by Vattel, it could not be applicable in the present case, even 
if admitted, unless there were also an admission of fact. 
That is, that his Majesty's enemies were so distressed for 
want of provisions, that they were susceptible of being reduced by the capture of neutral vessels carrying provisions 
to them. This point I do not wish to discuss with you. As 
to the suspicion of having enemy's property on board, even 
supposing that could justify detention, it could justify nothing more, and in this case there is much more. There is 
taking property from its owners against their will, and giving them a supposed indemnity equally without their 
will." "But," said he, "it is customary in the Courts of 
Admiralty, whenever articles perishable in their nature must 
be endangered by the detention necessary until the determination of the cause for which they were taken, to sell the 
articles under a decree of the Court, and pay the proceeds 
to the party." "Even that," said I, "differs essentially 
from taking a man's property, and paying him according to 
your own estimation. A sale is attended with competition, 
and, where an article is in demand, will produce a price." 
"I believe," said he, "it is very well understood that the 
payments for the provisions that have been brought in were 
more advantageous to the merchants than a sale would have 
been." I thought it unnecessary to urge this point any 
further. The answer to the last observation is very obvious, 
but it had run wide from the position of a right to detain 
on suspicion, or any consequences deducible from it. 
</p><p>
As the principle of this order (I resumed) is not admitted 
by the American government, considerations of its peculiar 
inconvenience to the United States and their citizens form but 
a secondary ground of objection. Provisions are among the 
most valuable articles of our export trade. They are indeed 
more valuable, proportionally speaking, to us than to any 
other commercial nation ; a restraint therefore upon the freedom of this trade by external power has a more extensive 
operation upon our interests than upon those of any others, 
and it has the appearance of being specially pointed against 
us. For however general the expressions in which the order 
is couched may be, as comprehending all neutral nations, yet 
if, in the nature of things it can operate only against one, it 
must be understood to have had an application only to that 
nation. Besides this, if my information be accurate, the 
same rate of indemnity has in the cases of the late captures 
been allowed to the neutral proprietors of all the several 
nations. Now the same per centum upon a cargo coming 
from Hamburg might afford a very handsome profit, and 
coming from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> would give scarce any at all ; as 
in estimating the rate of profits upon any given capital, the 
time during which it is employed forms an essential ingredient. A vessel from Hamburg to France might perform ten 
or a dozen voyages to and fro in the course of a year. From 
America the average could not amount to more than two. 
The same rule, therefore, produces very different effects 
upon circumstances which nature has made so different. 
These observations are made not as admitting that any 
indemnity whatever could obtain our assent to the legality 
of captures, but in order to show the character of the order 
itself, by the partial and unequal effects that it necessarily produces. 
</p><p>
He said that it would be shown by the accounts of the sums paid or to be paid by this government for these pro 
visions, that the American vessels brought in amounted to 
quite a small proportion of the whole ; that the order had in 
fact operated much more upon the nations up the Baltic 
than upon the United States, and that it was really intended 
that it should ; that he would direct that the amount of the 
accounts should be shown me ; and as to the rates of indemnity, he appeared in some measures to admit the reason 
of the observation I had made, but said that it was qualified 
by the circumstance of the great difference in the freights. 
The next particular of your instructions to which I adverted, was the stipulation in the second article of the treaty, 
for the delivery of the posts, and the previous measures 
provided to be taken to effect the evacuation. I told him I 
was ordered to urge for the immediate performance of that 
engagement. He said that the orders had been made for 
the purpose, and he believed they had been sent out. "But," 
said he, "it cannot be surprising if, upon seeing in what 
manner the treaty has been received in America, and the 
opposition which it has met and still meets there, we should 
think it necessary to be upon our guard. If, upon the meet 
ing of Congress, a difficulty should be raised and prevail 
against passing the laws which may be necessary to give 
effect to certain articles of the treaty, it cannot be expected 
that we should be willing to perform on our side without 
performance on the other." I then replied that I could not 
undertake to say before hand what the Congress of the 
United States in any instance would think proper to do. 
But I had not the smallest doubt and I believed this government had no reason to doubt, but that the United States 
would faithfully perform all their engagements. That with 
respect to the opposition advanced against the treaty, its 
appearance I had reason to believe from good authority, 
was more formidable than its reality ; that it was the nature 
of opposition to any public measure in that country to be 
bold, open, public, industrious, and active; that it was even 
more so there than elsewhere, and arose from the principle 
of liberty, upon which the government was founded ; that, 
upon an occasion of such universal interest as that treaty, 
opposition was very natural, and its ordinary character 
might derive from the importance of the subject an unusual 
degree of apparent energy, and it would show itself in its 
utmost extent, which was further magnified by a view of it 
at this distance. He said he could readily believe it, and that 
the force of the observation upon the character of opposition would be understood and acknowledged with peculiar conviction by Englishmen. 
</p><p>
I then added, "I am thoroughly convinced that the engagements of the American government will be punctually 
discharged, and I hope most sincerely that if on either side 
of the water there are persons really desirous to revive the 
causes of former differences, or to generate occasions for 
new ones, persons who wish to accumulate irritations, which 
the interest of both nations would entirely remove, and to 
instigate a failure on their own side as a provocation to the 
other, their views may be entirely frustrated." He then 
repeated that " he believed the orders for the evacuation of 
the posts had been sent out." 
</p><p>
After saying thus much upon the matters relating to the 
treaty, I observed that there were two new aggressions, on 
the part of officers in his Majesty's service, which it was my 
duty to recall to his lordship's recollection. A memorial 
on the subject had been presented by Mr. Deas, and he 
had sent the documents by which the facts were substantiated. It remained only for me to repeat the demand of 
reparation for what was considered by the American government as an outrageous violation of their territorial jurisdiction, and as being highly aggravated by an attack upon 
a foreign minister entitled to all the protection which the 
laws of nations could give to such a character. That the 
instance was indeed of such a complexion that the President 
had thought proper to revoke the exequatur of Mr. Moore, his Majesty's Vice Consul at Rhode Island, who appeared 
to have cooperated in the offense to such a degree as made 
it proper for the American government to do itself justice as far as concerned him. 
</p><p>
He said that immediately upon receiving information of 
the charge against Captain Home, an order had been issued 
by the Lords of Admiralty to him for the purpose of hearing 
what he should have to say in his justification ; that he could 
assure me no officer in his Majesty's service would ever be 
countenanced in such acts as the violation of a friendly 
nation's territorial rights, aggravated by an injury to the 
privileged character of a foreign minister. He mentioned 
this the rather, because, although no representations on the 
affair had yet been received from Captain Home himself, 
he had reason to suppose, from other statements which he 
had seen, that the violation of territory would be denied by 
the captain, who would maintain that the transaction took 
place at such a distance from the American coast as took it 
altogether out of the territorial jurisdiction of the United 
States. I told him that the determination of this government, or the evidence upon which they might found it, was 
not a subject for my consideration. I should only remark, 
from a personal knowledge of the place where the event 
occurred, and of the points from and to which the packet 
was going, that the pretence that the fact happened upon the 
high seas out of our jurisdiction, if raised, would, in my 
opinion, be disproved by the simple local relation of the 
places. 
</p><p>
"With respect to the case of Mr. Moore (said Lord Gren- 
villc) that is a little different. An express stipulation of 
the treaty gives each of the two governments the right of 
dismissing the consuls of the other for such reasons as itself thinks proper. Whether the reason be good or bad, it is 
the mere exercise of a right reserved, upon which the other 
government has nothing to say. So that the President, if 
he pleased, might dismiss a man because he took a dislike to his 
face, and we should have no right to object against it. I 
have, therefore, taken his Majesty's pleasure for appoint 
ing a person in the place of Mr. Moore, and it is a matter 
upon which no question can arise. But if, to go any further, 
my opinion is asked in this case, I can have no hesitation in 
saying that I think Mr. Moore has been a little hastily dealt 
with. That the mere circumstance of his sending a letter 
from Captain Home to the Governor of Rhode Island did 
not merit such pointed severity. For, however offensive 
the letter might be, he sent it at the express requisition of 
Captain Home, which he could not refuse, Captain Home 
being in his Majesty's service an officer so vastly superior in 
rank to himself." "My orders were," said I, "to explain 
the reasons upon which this act of the President was 
grounded, and to observe that it was not only because Mr. Moore sent the insulting letter to the Governor of Rhode 
Island, but because his presence on board the Africa, at the 
time when the other outrage was committed, gave strong 
ground for suspicion that he was accessary to that. These 
reasons were deemed sufficient by the President. He trusts 
they will be so by this government ; and you may be assured 
that no trivial cause, nor any such reason as the President's 
taking a dislike to a man's face, would induce him to the 
removal of any one." "No, no, (said he) I was not speak 
ing officially, and only meant, in giving you my opinion, to 
put an extreme case to show my idea of the principle." 
</p><p>
Respecting the other case, the same orders have been 
issued from the Admiralty, to the captain of the Hermione, in order to know what he can say for his justification. "I 
am directed on this occasion," said I, "to urge that more 
pointed orders may be given, to prevent the repetition of 
this evil. It is a great evil, and is continually recurring. 
I may add that it is of a nature extremely calculated to 
produce irritation and resentment. It couples insult with 
injury in a manner which naturally makes not only the sufferers, but numbers of their fellow citizens, think it intolerable. The government of the United States, for these 
reasons, wish that some equitable agreement on the subject 
may put an end to complaints to which they cannot be in attentive." 
</p><p>
He said they were very willing to make such an agreement 
as might result from a fair and candid discussion of the subject. That he had already had, when Mr. Jay was here, 
much conversation with him upon it, and that it was then 
understood to be one of the points reserved for future consideration. The question involved in it was on both sides 
difficult. For instance, if a sailor belonging to one of the 
king's ships stationed on the American coast, should desert 
and run away from his ship, it could not be supposed that he 
thereby changed his allegiance or acquired a right to the 
protection of the United States as an American citizen. On 
the other hand, all those who, before the war, were inhabit 
ants of America, and had continued to be so, wherever 
born, were doubtless to be considered as American citizens 
and entitled to protection. That between these two extreme points there was a great variety of gradations, and it 
must be a delicate thing on both sides to fix the line of demarcation ; that in the particular instance of the settlers, 
etc., within the posts to be evacuated, the treaty had ascertained the proceedings whereby every individual might 
make and declare his election, and he should cheerfully attend to any observations that might occur to me on the view of the subject as a general question. 
</p><p>
Before I proceed to a few remarks which I shall take the 
liberty to submit, suggested by this conversation, I have to 
notice a proposal of Lord Grenville's respecting the two 
important Commissions, and which escaped my recollection, when I gave in the beginning of this letter an account 
of the agreement as to the pay of the Commissioners. He 
said that the treaty stipulated nothing as to the appointment 
of the secretaries to these Commissions. He supposed it 
would not be thought necessary to have more than one 
secretary for each of them, and it would be perhaps eligible 
that the person should not be obliged to go beyond sea. 
His offer therefore was that the Secretary of the Commission 
to sit at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> [be appointed] by the American government, at the same time reserving to the Commissioners in 
both instances the right of objecting to the appointment of 
any person who might be not agreeable to them. I answered 
that having no communication from the government of the 
United States on this head, I could not say what their opinions would be ; whether this arrangement would meet their 
ideas or whether they would prefer having the secretaries appointed as of course by the Commissioners themselves, 
but that I would transmit the suggestion he now made for their consideration. 
</p><p>
In the relation that is now before you, Sir, it has been 
endeavored to give you the substance of everything that 
was said on either side, and a verbal accuracy has been pre 
served as far as it could be retained in memory. 
</p><p>
The proposal for discriminating between the Commissioners in the article of compensation left me only the alternative of consenting to the highest sums or creating a 
further delay of four or five months. It was doubtless made 
with that intention, and affords a specimen of the style of 
negotiation which it may be expected will be pursued. That 
delay, at least as to the performance of their engagements, 
is a real object which this government have in view, may be 
collected from various concurring circumstances. As to 
the evacuation of the posts, it will be observed that the 
intention of making that depend upon what shall be done 
be Congress at their meeting respecting the treaty was 
clearly avowed, and although a belief was professed that the 
orders were already sent out, yet it is evident from the whole 
that was said on that head, taken together, either that no 
such orders have been sent, or that they are made conditional, to be executed or not according to circumstances. 
This belief of the principal Secretary of State, upon such a 
point as the present, is itself a ground of suspicion that his 
creed is not in this respect entirely conformable to his knowledge. Mr. Deas was at first expressly told that the orders 
were sent out. I was told the same thing by Mr. Hammond 
the first time of my seeing him here ; and now my Lord Grenville only believes them gone. 
</p><p>
The attempt at argument in support of the order for taking vessels laden with provisions will be appreciated by the 
President at its proper value. It was such as made it unnecessary to contest the principles ; a mere denial of their 
application sufficed. The indifference and readiness with 
which such reasons are advanced may serve to show the 
degree of stress which is laid upon the reason of their conduct, 
and what proportion it bears to their conviction that it 
must in truth rest upon their sense of power. This order has 
been revoked, and will not be revived so long as the costs 
of their captures will evidently amount higher than their 
value to the captors. This circumstance supplied the principal or only motive for its removal ; and when it shall no 
longer exist, the expectation that any consideration of justice, humanity, or neutral rights will prevent its revival for 
so much as an hour, would be as little warranted by present probability as by past experience. 
</p><p>
In the case of Captain Home's violence and outrage, it 
seems that a pretence for bearing him out is assumed already, before any species of defence has been received from 
himself ; and as to that of Mr. Moore, the words underscored 
in the above relation were expressly used. The disposition 
of mind which they discover shall remain without comment 
from me, and I shall only permit myself to add, that by 
repeating distinctly some of those words, it was meant to 
show that they had not passed unnoticed, and that by saying 
no further, sensations were suppressed which, if indulged, would have retorted scorn for scorn. 
</p><p>
That Mr. Moore had thought himself bound in duty to 
send to the Governor of Rhode Island copy of a letter 
he had received, insolent and insulting to the Governor, 
because the writer of the letter had requested him so to do, had 
indeed been advanced by Mr. Moore himself ; but the reason 
assigned by Lord Grenville, as proving that such was his 
duty, belongs entirely to him. It is that Captain Home was 
superior in rank to the Vice Consul : a reason to justify 
vicarious insolence, which, however, consonant to the practice of this country, will be considered as more than disputable in the United States. 
</p><p>
In this conversation it will perhaps appear that the objection against Mr. Deas for the manner in which he has 
expressed the sentiments of the American government did not come with much weight from a person using such language on his side. Mr. Deas is doubtless equal to his own 
justification, and if the language of his memorial was warm, it was such as the occasion naturally suggested. 
</p><p>
With respect to the pressing of seamen, it will be observed 
in the newspapers that notice issued yesterday from the 
Admiralty office, that directions have been given not to press 
any more men regularly protected. Whether these directions will meet with proper execution, time alone will unfold. 
</p><p>
I am in hopes of Mr. Pinckney's return within a few days ; 
by Christmas at latest. I expect it with anxiety, being 
ardently desirous to resign into his hands a task to which I 
must take the liberty of observing that I am altogether in 
adequate ; and a trust the extensive importance of which 
could not be fully perceived at the time when my orders to 
repair hither were transmitted. From the foregoing account 
an opinion may be formed how far the relative situation of 
the United States and this country is still critical ; and it 
would not become me to suggest what measures the interests 
and the security of the former may render advisable. That 
the disposition here is candid, harmonious, or sincere may be 
believed, if the amplest professions are to be admitted for 
substantial proof. 
</p><p>
I have the honor &c.
