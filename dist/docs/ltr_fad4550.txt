Sir, 
</p><p>
My predecessor has sent me a letter, which you wrote to him on the nineteenth instant, demanding reparation for an 
outrage committed on board the American ship, Little Cherub. The report made on this subject has been transmitted to you. 
</p><p>
The numerous occupations of the Comite de Salut Public 
not having yet allowed them to pursue the matter, I have 
thought it my duty to press a decision by a letter, of which I 
send you a copy, and I hope to announce to you in a short 
time the reparation you demand in the name of your constituents. 
</p><p>
I seize with eagerness this occasion to assure you, that 
the change of the chief in the department of Foreign Affairs 
will, in no degree, influence the amicable dispositions, which 
have hitherto existed in your political relations with this department. These dispositions are those of the whole nation, 
and every agent of the French people should be obliged to 
conform himself thereto, even if he had not, as in my case, 
the highest esteem, and fraternal attachment for the United 
States. 
</p><p>
I trust, Sir, that events more propitious, than those now in 
question, will become the subject of our correspondence, and 
that, instead of reparations, I shall have to announce to you 
only the spontaneous testimonies of the friendship of all my 
fellow citizens for their allies. I have the honor to be, &c.
