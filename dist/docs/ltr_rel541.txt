My Precious Life:  This is the first day I have had leisure to answer
your letter.  I enjoyed it very much at the time of its reception,
and have enjoyed it since, but I have often thought of you in the
meantime, and have seen you besides.  Indeed, I may say, you are never
out of my thoughts.  I hope you think of me often, and if you could
know how earnestly I desire your true happiness, how ardently I pray
you may be directed to every good and saved from every evil, you would
as sincerely strive for its accomplishment.  Now in your youth you must
be careful to discipline your thoughts, words, and actions.  Habituate
yourself to useful employment, regular improvement, and to the benefit
of all those around your.  You have had some opportunity of learning
the rudiments of your education--not as good as I should have desired,
but I am much cheered by the belief that you availed yourself of it--
and I think you are now prepared by diligence and study to learn
whatever you desire.  Do not allow yourself to forget what you have
spent so much time and labour acquiring, but increase it every day by
extended application.  I hope you will embrace in your studies all
useful acquisitions.  I was much pleased to hear that while at 'Bremo'
you passed much of your time in reading and music.  All accomplishments
will enable you to give pleasure, and thus exert a wholesome influence.
Never neglect the means of making yourself useful in the world.  I
think you will not have to complain of Rob again for neglecting your
schoolmates.  He has equipped himself with a new uniform from top to
toe, and, with a new and handsome horse, is cultivating a marvellous
beard and preparing for conquest.  I went down on the lines to the
right, Friday, beyond Rowanty Creek, and pitched my camp within six
miles of Fitzhugh's last night.  Rob came up and spent the night with
me, and Fitzhugh appeared early in the morning.  They rode with me
till late that day.  I visited the battlefield in that quarter, and
General Hampton in describing it said there had not been during the
war a more spirited charge than Fitzhugh's division made that day up
the Boydton plank road, driving cavalry and infantry before him, in
which he was stopped by night.  I did not know before that his horse
had been shot under him.  Give a great deal of love to your dear mother,
and kiss your sisters for me.  Tell them they must keep well, not talk
too much, and go to bed early.

                                   Ever your devoted father,
