Hi Hans. I enjoyed your letter. To tell you the truth, I feel more like an older sister than an aunt (what's our age difference, 13 years?).
Oh well, that doesn't matter. My ex-husband is 8 years younger than I, and most of my classmates in
school were also around 8-10 years younger.<br><br>
My memories of Hayden... hmm, let's see. He was older than I by quite a bit, and had moved away from home when I was about 7. I recall one 
instance at that time where he and my father were not getting along, and my father was trying to force hayden to stay in his room. Then, the
next memory comes at about age 12 for me, with Gayle (or is it Gail?) and Hayden coming to visit at Christmas with a new baby (you). The thing 
that I recall is that my father favored harvey, and there was a lot of tension between my dad and Hayden. It seemed to me that no matter what 
Hayden did, my father disapproved. I do not know why, as I was too young to really know the history of that relationship, and my parents did not
communicate very well with their children. It was only after I had left home and returned to college (at age 25) that I could even begin to talk 
much with my mother about our family. She very soon thereafter died. My father cannot or willnot talk about a lot of things.
I will probably never be able to communicate well with him.<br><br>
Hayden and I were closest to my mom - we were her "favorites". Harvey and Laurie are closest to my dad - they are his "favorites". I will share
some reflections of our family with you, because I think that you can realize there is no one final pure image of Hayden that anyone (even probably 
Hayden himself) can give you.<br><br>
First, I would like to say that I loved your father very much. I don't know exactly why, because I really didn't spend a lot of time with him. I 
remember him as always trying to win my father's approval or love, and always losing out. He wanted Harvey to accept him too, and at the same time 
there was a sibling rivalry. Now here is where my own subjective distortion will certainly come into play, but I will let you read this as simply 
one persons's opinions.<br><br>
As I said before, my dad favored Harvey. Harvey was the "good son", who didn't seem to cause major problems. Harvey was in many ways, a lot like
my dad: got married young, went the "company route" with a job, naver graduated college, worked hard, followed ther rules. Harvey is very smart, but he,
in my opinion did not question authority.[note:some content not included due to sensitive nature - HAB]<br><br>
I was much younger than Hayden, and I seldom saw or talked with him much until I was 19, and then I visited him in Palo Alto (<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1974">1974</a>?) for the summer. It
was also that year that I met with you, Heidi and your mom.<br><br>
All I really heard about Hayden while I was growing up was negative. My mom didn't criticize him, but my dad and Harvey constantly found fault with him.
OK, well, maybe Hayden did pull some major screwups, I don't know. Hayden was not only willing to question authority - he also alledgedly threw it out
the window (like a boomerang) a lot. But I personally have no knowledge of that. I think that sometimes authority does need to be questioned, but the 
actions that can result have consequences, and if its possible to consider them, its a good idea.<br><br>
I don't know why Hayden often seemed to get caught in the consequences. One can only speculate - my feeling is that he had a poor "dysfunctional" role 
model in Howard, that he craved approval from my dad that would never come, and he blamed himself. My father may have loved him, but my father did not
understand Hayden, nor the world, and my father could do nothing but criticize what he could not understand. (remember Archie Bunker?) So you can see
that I am biased quite decidedly against my father in certain ways. I see Hayden as having had the courage to think about life, even if he did sometimes
falter in his actions.<br><br>

I really like hearing from you, but believe me I know how hectic life/school/work can get. I happen to have time now, so I can write. Sorry about the 
handwriting!<br><br>
The snow here is amazing. Texas had no snow. I'm probably not going to stay here, but it's a change from Houston that I find refreshing. Well Hans - I
will tell you that I know your father woul also want to say:<br><br>
I'm proud of you.<br>
Keep your dreams alive.<br>
I love you, I'm family,<br>
I know that  you can be whatever you decide to be.<br><br>
love,<br>
Anne Marie<br><br>
I will write about specific memories of hayden next letter - this is a preface.
