SIR, 
</p><p>
Since the action of the 19th ultimo, the enemy 
have kept the ground they occupied the morning of 
that day, and fortified their camp. The advanced sentries of my pickets are posted within shot, and opposite the enemy's. Neither side have given ground an 
inch. In this situation, your Excellency would not 
wish me to part with the corps the army of <a href="/results.php?tla=jhb" rel="adversary">General Burgoyne</a> are most afraid of. From the best intelligence, he has not more than three weeks provision in 
store ; it will take him at least eight days to get 
back to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> ; so that, in a fortnight at farthest, he must decide whether he will rashly risk, at 
infinite disadvantage, to force my camp, or retreat to 
his den. In either case, I must have the fairest prospect to be able to reenforce your Excellency, in a 
more considerable manner than by a single regiment. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to repeat to your Excellency the Distress I have suffered for want of a proper supply of 
musket cartridges from Springfield, or the materials to 
make them. The inclosed, from the Commissary of 
Ordnance Stores at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, will convince your Excellency of the truth of this assertion. My anxiety, also, 
upon account of provisions has been inexpressible ; a greater error has not been committed this war than 
the changing the Commissaries in the middle of the campaign. You, Sir, must have your grievances. I. therefore, will not enhance them by enlarging upon mine. I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
