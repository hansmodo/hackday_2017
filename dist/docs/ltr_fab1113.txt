Since I last wrote you, last month, the country has greatly improved. The weather is delightful, the roads superb. Riding out is all the rage. We have bought a splendid horse brought up from Monterey. He just takes the road now, I can tell you, and such a beautiful gait as he has! He lopes off for an hour, just as a cradle. I went out riding with a lady for the first time the other day--a Mrs. Stevens from Kentucky. She came over the plains last season and her husband died last winter. She is young and pretty and all ready to form another co-partnership, but 'beware of the Vidders Samuel'! She is perfectly at home on horseback, so rides beautifully. We rode out about ten miles into the country and such a country as we have to ride in! It can't be beat. The road from here to Mormon Island follows the bank of the American Fork 25 miles over a smooth rolling prairie interspersed with groves of oak and covered in some part
with most splendid wild flowers. Every two or three miles are Public Houses where families have settled down. Sundays these houses are crowded with people from the city and horse flesh has to suffer some. The ladies ride out here a great deal. I admire seeing a lady riding on horseback when she is not afraid. I wish I could take you out on our horse for I believe you would make a fearless rider.

Cole has bought half of Lindley's Ranch. They have a Public House and had stock. It is a pretty place, seven miles from Marysville and a good speculation. We are going into the lumber business for the present here have a good yard and ten cargoes to sell.

Sewell sold his ticket and came upon a sailing vessel, 48 days passage. He is very well contented and is earning eight dollars per day. I received a cravat and some books. Please accept my thanks, whoever sent them.

Capt. Ginn is at work for us. He has gotten pretty well sobered. He lost his trunk and got here without a dime and no clothes except those he had on. If he will stop drinking he can do well. He says he shall drink no more... 'quien sabe?'

The fashionable season has commenced in Bucksport I suppose. Write me all the items for anything from there interests me. I like this country so well that it is doubtful whether I come to the States again, except to make a visit. I want to live on a ranch and own about 5000 acres of land and a thousand head of cattle and horses. That is the kind of a farm for me. I should live perfectly contentedly if I could spend half of my time on horseback, scouring over the prairies free as air. I am tired of trade, of trying to sell a man an article when he doesn't want it and I think I shall get out of it this Fall. It is the best business a man can follow, too. If you had to pay the prices we do for vegetables and milk, you would think so.

There are plenty of gardens here and they do well. We have green peas, lettuce, turnips, etc., and splendid salmon and if we only had a cook we could live well. There are seven of us living in our store. They pay $15 per week and help cook. Hadn't you better come out and keep boarders? You may have the upper part of our store.
