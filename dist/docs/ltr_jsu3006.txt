DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
This morning at daybreak, I received your Excellency's favor of the 16th instant; am extremely mortified to find that every thing here has turned out 
contrary to my expectations, and your Excellency's 
wishes. This was not owing to my being deceived 
with respect to the enemy on the ground at the 
time I wrote, but to the sudden arrival of such a 
number under <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>, the night before 
the battle of Three Rivers, of which I have given 
a full and perfect account in former letters. I 
am conscious of having done every thing in my 
power to gain the ground our troops had lost, and 
to secure the retreat of the army, when I found our point could not be carried. I imagine that <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a> forgot to inclose the return, as I think -it 
went from me at the time; "but I am not clear whether it did not go in a separate letter. I dare say 
it has reached you before this. I now inclose an 
other which I wish safe to hand, and hope to have 
a more complete and , perfect one in a few days, 
which I shall forward to your. Excellency. 
</p><p>
I am well convinced of the necessity of a good 
understanding being kept up among the officers of 
the army. This has been remarkably the case since 
my arrival. I have not seen an instance to the contrary, except some few reflections which seemed to 
take place between the northern and southern troops, 
which I hope I have sufficiently cured by calling 
upon the officers of every corps, and requesting them 
to suppress a thing, which, if continued, must weaken, 
if not destroy, the army. They all agreed to join 
heartily in putting an end to this dangerous behaviour among the troops, which I am convinced they 
did, as I have heard nothing of it since, and find 
that harmony takes place among the troops in a surprising manner. In all our difficulties there seemed 
a unanimity of sentiment among all the officers. 
Indeed, I have not known the least dispute among 
them. The unfortunate General Thompson, the Baron de Woedtke, and myself were at <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a>. Never did 
greater harmony and friendship exist. <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>General Arnold</a> was at Montreal, and kept up the most friendly 
intercourse and correspondence with us, and we with 
him. It is true, I thought the keeping Colonel De-haas from <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a> was wrong, but only supposed it an 
error in judgment, as I did that of his keeping the 
forces in too great numbers at the posts up the country. This I communicated to him in the most friendly manner, which he accounted for in a way 
that convinced- me that he acted not without some 
foundation ; though I think it would have been better 
had it not been done. Assure yourself, my dear 
General, that I will exert myself in cultivating harmony and friendship among both officers and soldiers 
in the army, and that I am, with the most profound 
respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most devoted, humble servant,

P. S. The Brigade-Major and Adjutant of the day 
have this moment informed me, that, while they 
were parading the main guard, four men dropped 
down under arms, and appear like dead men. I am 
almost distracted with the thought of losing so many 
men as daily go off by sickness. I shall, to-day, remove from this infectious place to Isle-la-Motte, 
which I should have done before now, had not too 
many of our bateaux gone forward with the sick to 
Crown Point.
