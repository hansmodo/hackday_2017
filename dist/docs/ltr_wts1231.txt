Dear Brother : I owe you a personal explanation as 
to why I did not come to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> during my last 
visit East. After positively refusing to attend the banquet to the Loyal Legion at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a> (President Hayes 
the Commander), I was persuaded at the last minute 
that I ought to go. After I had packed my valise, I 
heard of General Hancock's death, made one or two 
despatches to General Whipple as Adjutant-General, my 
former Aide, asking him to communicate with me at the 
Burnet House. 1 On arrival, I was met by President 
Hayes and General Cox and others, who explained that 
[by] the death of General Hancock, the president of the 
Order of the Loyal Legion, they had been forced to 
modify their programme, and that I must respond to the 
memory of General Hancock. I was kept busy all that 
day by a stream of visitors, and when the company had 
assembled for the banquet, full four hundred in the 
room, without notes or memoranda, I spoke for about 
ten minutes. My words were taken down and sent off 
without a chance of revision, but I afterwards learned 
that Mrs. Hancock was especially pleased. At the 
Burnet House I got all the notices of the funeral, which 
compelled me to travel to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. En route was 
delayed a couple of hours by the flood in Delaware. It 
was two o'clock at night before I could lie down, and I 
had to be up at six to go down to the Battery, where the 
funeral was to commence. We were kept busy till 
night, when Miles and I went to Elly's 2 for dinner, and 
it was midnight when we got to the Fifth Avenue 
Hotel. . .

Affectionately yours,
