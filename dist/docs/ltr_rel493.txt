                                 Harper's Ferry, December 1, 1859.
<p></p>
I arrived here, dearest Mary, yesterday about noon, with four companies
from Fort Monroe, and was busy all the evening and night getting
accommodation for the men, etc., and posting sentinels and piquets to
insure timely notice of the approach of the enemy.  The night has
passed off quietly.  The feelings of the community seem to be calmed
down, and I have been received with every kindness.  Mr. Fry is among
the officers from Old Point.  There are several young men, former
acquaintances of ours, as cadets, Mr. Bingham of Custis's class, Sam
Cooper, etc., but the senior officers I never met before, except
Captain Howe, the friend of our Cousin Harriet R---.

I presume we are fixed her till after the 16th.  To-morrow will
probably be the last of Captain Brown.  There will be less interest
for the others, but still I think the troops will not be withdrawn
till they are similarly disposed of.
<p></p>
Custis will have informed you that I had to go to Baltimore the evening
I left you, to make arrangements for the transportation of the
troops....  This morning I was introduced to Mrs. Brown, who, with a
Mrs. Tyndall and a Mr. And Mrs. McKim, all from Philadelphia, had come
on to have a last interview with her husband.  As it is a matter over
which I have no control I referred them to General Taliaferro [General
William B. Taliaferro, commanding Virginia troops at Harper's Ferry].
<p></p>
You must write to me at this place.  I hope you are all well.  Give
love to everybody.  Tell Smith [Sydney Smith Lee, of the United States
Navy, his brother] that no charming women have insisted on taking care
of me as they are always doing of him--I am left to my own resources.
I will write you again soon, and will always be truly and affectionately
yours,
<p></p>
