MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
I ARRIVED here last evening, in good health. This 
morning General Whipple made me a visit at the tavern, Tilton's, and insisted upon my taking a bed at his 
house, in so very affectionate and urgent a manner, 
that I believe I shall go to his house. 
</p><p>
The cause comes on to-morrow before my old friend 
Dr. Joshua Brackett as judge of admiralty. How it 
will go, I know not. The captors are a numerous 
company, and are said to be very tenacious, and have 
many connexions; so that we have prejudice and influence to fear. Justice, policy and law are, I am 
sure, on our side. 
</p><p>
I have had many opportunities, in the course of 
this journey, to observe how deeply rooted our righteous cause is in the minds of the people ; and could 
write you many anecdotes in proof of it. But I will 
reserve them for private conversation. On second 
thoughts, why should I ? One evening, as I satin one 
room, I overheard a company of the common sort of 
people in another, conversing upon serious subjects. 
One of them, whom I afterwards found upon inquiry to be a reputable, religious man, was more eloquent 
than the rest. He was upon the danger of despising 
and neglecting serious things, and said, " Whatever per 
son or people made light of them, would soon find them 
selves terribly mistaken." At length I heard these 
words : " It appears to me the eternal son of God is 
operating powerfully against the British nation for 
their treating lightly serious things." 
</p><p>
One morning I asked my landlady what I had to 
pay ? " Nothing," she said, " I was welcome, and 
she hoped I would always make her house my home. 
And she should be happy to entertain all those gentlemen who had been raised up by <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> to be 
the saviours of their country." This was flattering 
enough to my vain heart. But it made a greater impression on me, as a proof how deeply this cause had 
sunk into the minds and hearts of the people. 
</p><p>
In short, every thing I see and hear indicates the 
same thing.
