DEAR SIR : I have been at Blair Drummond on a visit 
to my friend Lord Kames, thence I went to Glasgow, thence 
to Carron Works, viewing the Canal by the way. Extreme bad weather detained me in several places some days longer 
than I intended. But on Tuesday I purpose setting out on 
my return, and hope for the pleasure of seeing you by the 
Tuesday following. I thank you for your kind congratulations on the news you have heard. I like immortal friendships, 
but not immortal enmities; and therefore kill the latter 
whenever I have a good opportunity, thinking it no murder. 
I am but just come back hither, and write this line just to 
let you know I am well and again under the hospitable roof 
of the good Samaritan. As to news, which you seem to expect from me, I protest I know of none, and I am too dull 
for invention. My love to Mrs. Strahan and your children, 
and believe me, ever, my dear friend, Yours most affectionately, B. FRANKLIN.
