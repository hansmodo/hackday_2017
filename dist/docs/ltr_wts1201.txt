HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE UNTTEP STATES,

Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
I saw <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> when he was here some days ago, 
and we talked about . . . and my published decimation of a nomination by either party. I told him plainly 
that the South would go against him en masse, though 
he counts on South Carolina, Louisiana, and Arkansas ; 
but I repeated my conviction, that all that was vital at 
the South was against him, and that negroes were generally quiescent and could not be relied on as voters when 
local questions become mixed up with political matters. 
I think, however, he will be renominated and re-elected, 
unless by personally doing small things, to alienate his 
party adherence of the North. . . . 
</p><p>
My office has been by law stript of all the influence 
and prestige it possessed under Grant, and even in matters of discipline and army control I am neglected, overlooked, or snubbed. I have called <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant's</a> 
attention to the fact several times, but got no satisfactory redress. 
</p><p>
The old regulations of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1853">1853</a>, made by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jed rel="adversary">Jeff. Davis</a> in 
hostility to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague met">General Scott</a>, are now strictly construed 
and enforced ; and in these regulations the War Department is everything, and the name of General, LieutenantGeneral, or Commander-in-Chief even, does not appear 
in the book. Consequently, orders go to parts of the 
army supposed to be under my command, of which I 
know nothing till I read them in the newspapers ; and 
when I call the attention of the Secretary to it, he 
simply refers to some paragraph of the Army Regulations. Some five years ago there was a law to revise 
these Regulations, and to make them conform to the 
new order of things, and to utilize the experiences of the 
war. A Board was appointed here in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, composed of Sherman, Sheridan, and Auger, that did so 
revise them, and they were submitted to Congress with 
the approval of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> ; but no action was taken. 
But now a new Board is ordered to prepare another set, 
and this Board is composed of a set of officers hardly 
qualified to revise the judgment of the former Board. 
I propose patiently to await the action of this Board, 
though now that war is remote, there is little chance of 
Congress giving the army a thought at all ; and if these 
new regulations were framed, as I suppose, to cripple 
the power of the General, and to foster the heads of staff 
departments, I will simply notify the President that I 
cannot undertake to command an army with all its staff 
independent of the Commander-in-Chief, and ask him 
to allow me quietly to remove to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a>, to do such 
special matters as may be committed to me by the President, and leave the Army to be governed and commanded as now, by the Secretary of War, in person. 
This cannot occur for twelve months. . . . 
</p><p>
I have said nothing of this to anybody, and will not 
do anything hasty or rash; but I do think that because some newspapers berate Grant about his military 
surroundings, he feels disposed to go to the other 
extreme. . . . Affectionately, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wts" rel="me">W. T. SHERMAN</a>.
