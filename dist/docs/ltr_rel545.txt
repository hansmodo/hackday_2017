My Dear Rob:  I have just returned from a visit to your Uncle Carter,
and, among my letters, find one from some of your comrades to you,
which I inclose.  I was happy to discover from the direction that it
was intended for you and not for me.  I find Agnes quite sick, and
have sent for the doctor, as I do not know what to do for her.  Poor
little thing! she seems quite prostrated.  Custis, I am told, is
better.  He is still at Mrs. Cocke's.  The rest of us are well.  I
saw several of your comrades, Cockes, Kennons and Gilliams, who inquired
after you all.  Give my love to F. and Johnny, in which all here unite,
and believe me most truly and affectionately
</p><p>
                       Your father,
