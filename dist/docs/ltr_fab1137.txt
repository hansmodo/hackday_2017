Excuse the exuberance of my pen in this letter and attribute all the faults to my being in this city for the first time since I left it 14 months ago and meeting with all my old friends: Hock and Soda, etc., etc. You can imagine the rest.

I came down a delegate to the Whig State Convention from Trinity County. Stopped a day with Lindley at Marysville and two days in Sacramento. We have put our best man (Captain Waldi) out for Governor and are of course sanguine of beating the Bight clique. Saw men from all the thirty five counties in the state in the convention and after due consideration, I pronounce the Whig Party here to be the salt of the earth; composed of the finest men in the state.

Came down here Friday night. Have been with Sewall every day. He has been to Oregon. At present is doing nothing--has not made up his mind what to do and I don't know what advice to give him. I have seen so little of him that he seems almost a stranger to me and his
acquaintances and mine are altogether different men. We appear to move in different circles. He knows nobody whom I know. Sewall is stout and healthy but he seems to be adverse to doing anything and each time I have found him he has been doing nothing. This won't do in this country. A man is on expense and if not going ahead is going back. I shall talk with him some more before I leave and try and get him a situation in a store here.

I find a year makes great changes here. Several of my old friends are missing--dead--and gone to other parts of the world.
</p><p>
Marysville has grown rapidly and is twice as big as when I left it. On the contrary, Sacramento has gone back and is now but a wreck of what it was. Fires and floods have almost blotted it out but it is again going ahead and in another year will perhaps get back again.

This city is the city of the Pacific --crowded with people of all nations and the buildings will vie with those of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a>. Everything: hotels, theatres, saloons, carriages and horses, men and women, are on a scale with any city in the States. Of course I am having a fine time. I always have here. This is my vacation and I let myself out loose you would think at home, probably, but don't be alarmed I have a well-balanced mind; reason is always on her throne. I like to have a good time as well as anybody but in a decent genteel way, of course.

I sent my train of mules to Colusa and shall buy enough goods to load them there and go up Wednesday and once more return to the shades of private life as a Country Merchant, not considered as honorable an occupation as an 'honest miner' but I like it better.
</p><p>
Write often, hermana mia. Adios. Hasta la tarde.
