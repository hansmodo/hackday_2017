<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='3'>3d</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=montgomery' rel='city origin'>MONTGOMERY</a>, Ala., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. Everybody in fine spirits in my world. 
They have one and all spoken in the Congress to their own perfect satisfaction. To my amazement the Judge 
took me aside, and, after delivering a panegyric upon him self (but here, later, comes in the amazement), he praised 
my husband to the skies, and said he was the fittest man of all for a foreign mission. Aye ; and the farther away they 
send us from this Congress the better I will like it.

Saw Jere Clemens and Nick Davis, social curiosities. They are Anti -Secession leaders ; then George Sanders and 
George Deas. The Georges are of opinion that it is folly to try to take back Fort Sumter from Anderson and 
the United States : that is, before we are ready. They saw in Charleston the devoted band prepared for the sacrifice; 
I mean, ready to run their heads against a stone wall. Dare devils they are. They have dash and courage enough, 
but science only could take that fort. They shook their heads.
