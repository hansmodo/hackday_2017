On the 7th of October our election for state and county officers took place. Everything passed off quietly, but the clerks of the election got so drunk they could not count off the votes and new ones had to be sworn in. The result of the election will not be known for several weeks as the land of telegraphs and railroads is far distant. Here we go by horse express.

Recently our town was thrown into excitement by the discovery of two murdered men, named Burke and Dolf, about one mile from this place. A jury went out and held an inquest and the bodies were brought in in a wagon and placed in the hospital where they were bathed and dressed, and buried the next morning. Their bodies were most horribly cut and mutilated, one with his head nearly cut off, from behind, a heavy gash in the face, and several deadly stabs in the breast. The other had a single cut across the head and face, which severed it in two pieces. They were horrible pictures to look upon. During the day they had been to an auction and purchased some clothing, and in the evening left for Sullivan's with a small piece of beef for their
supper. About eight o'clock they were found murdered, with their pockets turned inside out, evidently for plunder. The citizens offered a reward of $2,500 for the murderers but no clue has yet been found.

About ten days since, the Sonora Herald died, that is, became defunct for want of patronage, and consequently my employment ceased. The proprietors, not being able to hand over the dust, gave me their notes for five hundred dollars, but I fear I shall not be able to collect the money I have earned. If I should lose the whole of it, it will not discourage me, for I will "pick my flint and try again." I think money can be made here quicker than in any other part of the world. At any rate, I am not in debt and I hope I shall soon be able to transmit something to Mr. Evans. He shall lose nothing by me if I can keep my health.

My feet being very sore from poison, I laid by a few days, and one morning while going to my boarding house, cane in hand, whom should I meet but John L. Haines, Esq., of West Chester, Pa., and Mr. Enoch Davis of Charlestown Township. They had just come down from the northern mines. As they are old acquaintances, we held a long confab about friends and home, and our own successes and failures. From them we learned of the death of Jas. Dixon, Esq., near Georgetown in the northern mines, about the first of September. He is the fourth already dead of those who left West Chester for these auriferous regions and this, of itself, tells a fearful tale. Mr. Theodore Apple left for home a few days after.

Atkins and I commenced mining in company with Haines and Davis. We have been digging for the last four or five days just below town but the water has been so plentiful as to prevent us from going down to the
proper depth to get gold. Tomorrow we hope to get mucho oro, as the Greasers say.
