My old friend Harry
</p><p>

I have been writing and writing and writing to you ever since I am in the
army, and at last I've wakened
up all of a Sunday morning to
find myself sealed behind a whole
sheet of foolscap, trying to make it
look like a letter to old Southampton.
I would make an awful long yarn to
tell you everything that has happened
since I left home, in fact, twould
make a young history, so will try
our hand in the condensing line &
squeeze out all the little things retaining only the big facts. After our
regt. had been encamped on the sacred
soil of Va. for several weeks near Munson's Hill , we were attached to Gen. Duryee's
brigade then lying near Alexandria, and
our regt. was accordingly moved thither.
Next our regt. was detatched from the
brigade for awhile to guard the R.R. from
Alexandria to Manassas Junction. From this
we went 12 miles beyond Manassas Junction
to what is called Catlett's Station, but when <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=npb" rel="none">Banks</a> retreated, we fell back on Manassas
to defend that place. Here Ord's and Shields
divisions soon came pouring in like bees
and advanced thence to Front Royal
in pursuit of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tjj">Jackson</a> , at Manassas our
regt. or rather our brigade was attatched
to Ords , now Ricketts division. I suppose
you've read the letter describing this march
in the news. I was not along with the
regt. on this march, but got sick at Manassas, and was sent to Washing
ton , After Jackson disappeared our
divison fell back again on Catletts
Station where I rejoined my regt. after
an absence of about 3 or 4 weeks. Thence
we marched to Warrenton, County seat
of Fauquier, and from that again a dis
tance of 8 miles out here on the Rap
pahannock . We are now in Pope's great
army of Virginia. The men have great be-
lief in him and his energetic policy,
and all desire and expect that he will
soon give us a chance to distinguish
ourselves. We all regard his late stringent
orders as just the thing, and all are
down on slow coach <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gbm" rel="none">McLellan</a> , who
marched his army into the swamps of
the Chickahominy, and kept them intrenching and digging, while they were dying
by the thousand, and all this time
made no attempt on Richmond He occupies a splendid position on
the banks of the James, but why didnt
he go there in the first place. We expect better things of Pope who has already
proved himself no ordinary Gen. in the
Western Campaign. Our Col. (Ziegle) died
the other day. McAllen is too sickly to
take the command, so the Gov. I suppose
will appoint us a Col. Jake Gish just
got back from Washington last night
with his commission as 2nd Lieut. We
have bully officers. MacThompson is a
clever Capt., McPherson is clever, but
Gish is the best man of the party. The
boys all like him because he makes him-
self so common. Write and give me all
the news of Southampton, Shippensburg, the
schools, your studies, &c.

Truly your friend,
