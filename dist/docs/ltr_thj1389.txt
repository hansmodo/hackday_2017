<p>
TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.
</p><p>
In Council, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, March 26,<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1781">1781</a>.

Sir,
</p><p>
The appointment of commissioner to the war-office of this State having
lately become vacant, the Executive are desirous to place Colonel
William Davies, of the Virginia Continentals, in that office. This
gentleman, however, declines undertaking it, unless his rank in the
army, half pay for life and allowance for depreciation of pay, can be
reserved to him; observing with justice, that these emoluments, distant
as they are, are important to a person who has spent the most valuable
part of his youth in the service of his country. As this indulgence
rests in the power of Congress alone, I am induced to request it of them
on behalf of the State, to whom it is very interesting that the office
be properly filled, and I may say, on behalf of the Continent also, to
whom the same circumstance is interesting, in proportion to its reliance
upon this State for supplies to the southern war. We should not have
given Congress the trouble of this application, had we found it easy to
call any other to the office, who was likely to answer our wishes in the
exercise of it.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect,
</p><p>
your Excellency's most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="me">Th: Jefferson</a>.
