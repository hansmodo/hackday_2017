MR. O'Neil's, December 11, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1823">1823</a>. 
<p></p>
SIR: 
<p></p>
Your letter of to-day has been received. Whether 
the world are correct or in error, as regards my "magnanimity", is for the world to decide. I am satisfied 
of one fact, that when you shall know me better, you 
will not be disposed to harbor the opinion, that any 
thing like " desperation in resentment " attaches to me. 
<p></p>
Your letter is ambiguous; but, concluding from 
occurrences heretofore, that it was written with friend 
ly views, I take the liberty of saying to you, that when 
ever you shall feel disposed to meet me on friendly 
terms, that disposition will not be met by any other 
than a correspondent feeling on my part. 
<p></p>
have the honor to be, sir, 
Your most obedient servant, 
<p></p>
