Gentlemen:  I have delayed for some days replying to your letter of
the 5th inst., informing me of my election by the board of trustees
to the presidency of Washington College, from a desire to give the
subject due consideration.  Fully impressed with the responsibilities
of the office, I have feared that I should be unable to discharge its
duties to the satisfaction of the trustees or to the benefit of the
country.  The proper education of youth requires not only great ability,
but I fear more strength than I now possess, for I do not feel able
to undergo the labour of conducting classes in regular courses of
instruction.  I could not, therefore, undertake more than the general
administration and supervision of the institution.  I could not,
therefore, undertake more than the general administration and
supervision of the institution.  There is another subject which has
caused me some serious reflection, and is, I think, worthy of the
consideration of the board.  Being excluded from the terms of amnesty
in the proclamation of the President of the United States, of the
29th of May last, and an object of censure to a portion of the country,
I have thought it probable that my occupation of the position of
president might draw upon the college a feeling of hostility; and I
should, therefore, cause injury to an institution which it would be
my highest desire to advance.  I think it the duty of every citizen,
in the present condition of the country, to do all in his power to
aid in the restoration of peace and harmony, and in no way to oppose
the policy of the State or general government directed to that object.
It is particularly incumbent on those charged with the instruction of
the young to set them an example of submission to authority, and I
could not consent t be the cause of animadversion upon the college.
Should you, however, take a different view, and think that my services
in the position tendered to me by the board will be advantageous to
the college and country, I will yield to your judgement and accept it;
otherwise, I must most respectfully decline the office.  Begging you
to express to the trustees of the college my heartfelt gratitude for
the honour conferred upon me, and requesting you to accept my cordial
thanks for the kind manner in which you have communicated their
decision, I am, gentlemen, with great respect, your most obedient
servant,
