DEAR SIR--I have tried a long time to write you, but, since crossing the Missouri River, either sickness, extreme fatigue, or constant labor have totally prevented me. I have scarcely been able to write to my own family; and I have been compelled to make my journal, hastily written, subserve the place of correspondence to my most intimate friends, to whom I hoped and intended to have written frequently. You can form no idea of the labor, fatigue, trials and patience of an overland journey to this country. While traveling along the Platte for hundreds of miles, cold and rainy weather benumb your fingers while pitching tents, guarding cattle, preparing meals, gathering fuel so scantily distributed, and a thousand et ceteras blunt your faculties; and when the hour of quiet arrives at dark, you sink on your hard couch exhausted. It is the same when you reach the burning sand after passing the Platte; and, in addition to this, while traveling down the Humboldt (or Mary's River) the utmost vigilance is required to keep marauding bands of Indians from stealing or maiming your cattle; and you become wearied and worn out, so that if you lay over a day, you cannot collect sufficient energy scarcely to wash a shirt or mend your ragged and dilapidated garments. Any man who makes a trip by land to California deserves to find a fortune. The most of my writing has been done at our noon halts, often in the burning sun, for the little shade afforded by the
wagon would be occupied by the wearied men. But we have got safely through without losing or laming any of our cattle, a somewhat unusual circumstance, and no serious mishap occured except running short of provisions and living about three weeks on hard, dry bread and coffee. My journal, published in the Free Trader, will give you a general outline of our daily marches and adventures by the way; so I will not speak of them here. We made two grand errors: first, in taking the Nemaha Cut-off, which put us back eight or ten days; and next, leaving the Mary's River and taking the Oregon and California Trail, by which we lost three weeks' time in getting in, and on account of which we ran short of provisions and had to pass four hundred miles through hostile Indians that kept us on the lookout day and night. The Valley of the Sacramento, instead of being such a delightful region with its perennial spring, its blooming flowers, and clear sky, we found to be parched with drought, the grass dried to a crisp, the earth filled with wide cracks from the effects of a scorching sun and months without rain; indeed I have seen no rain from the 1st day of July to the 9th day of October, and there was nothing green for over a hundred miles that I have traveled except the oak and willow that line the banks of the streams. The atmosphere has been so smoky that I could rarely see the high mountains on either side of the Valley from the road, though only a few miles distant; while the nights have been uncomfortably cold (without frost), the days often burning hot. The soil in the immediate neighborhood of streams is no doubt good--equal to, though not better than, our prairies; but only one crop can be raised in a year on account of the drought. No doubt a change appears in the spring. During the rainy season all the low grounds are overflowed, while the deep soil, where it is more elevated, becomes so muddy that all communication ceases by teams and often for horses. It begins to rain in November usually, sometimes before, but business can be carried on till Christmas or the 1st of January, and during the month of February it is generally too wet to do outdoor work. Spring opens in March. Winter crops are put in the ground in October or November, and they mature before the extreme heat of summer comes on. But California is not destined to be an agricultural country so long as the mines are productive. The high price of labor will make the cost of grain much higher than it can be supplied from the States, and breadstuffs will continue to be imported probably for many years. But I suppose you desire to hear particularly about the gold region and the chances of getting gold. The result of my short residence here is this, and I think I am not far out of the way: Gold exists no doubt in large quantities in the mountains and
is washed down into the rivers and creeks by the annual floods. New discoveries are being made all the while, but it is not every man who comes here that will return rich. It is a kind of lottery. All are making some, and many are making fortunes, probably as many as ever. In following the streams, the bars and low places near the river are searched where the slate rock comes to or near the surface. The rock catches the flakes in its crevices as it is washed down; so that you will perceive at once that in some places there will be more than in others, while in some there will be none. Where you think it may be, you take off the top soil, stones, and sand or fine gravel, and scoop up all the sand and dirt near the rock and in the crevices; this you wash, and a few pans full will show whether there is gold there or not. The gold sinks to the bottom, being heavier than gravel or sand. Sometimes a new beginner may work a week and not pay his board; but he must learn the trade of washing and judging where it may lay, and he is sure to get something. Many get discouraged and go to other mines, while others work for weeks and make only five or ten dollars a day, and others strike a good lead and take out several thousand dollars in a few days. On this river many wing-dams have been made and in all cases, so far, have yielded a rich return. Four men may make a dam in one to two weeks and with the cradle and pan wash out large amounts. The stories you generally hear at home are of the lucky ones; those who have worked for weeks and have only cleared a small sum are not reported, and these are many. They become discouraged at one place and go to some other, where the same thing occurs, or they may strike a rich lead and do well, while others, coming to the mines that have just been abandoned, may do equally well. One day a man got $50, the next, perhaps, nothing; and so it goes. There seems, then, to be but one way to work in the mines, and that is to stick to it till your turn and time comes, and be not discouraged because you are getting nothing and the man within three feet of you is taking out $100 per day. The work is not more laborious than digging at home, about the same; and the man who can dig there all day can do the same here, and men unused to it must become inured to it. Wages paid in these mines for washing is from $8 to $10 per day--$8 and $10 and found--at $12 the man finds himself. Board in the mines $3 to $4 per day, which leaves about $8 clear. I think the price of labor may decline some when the whole emigration gets in, though it will always be high. Hauling provisions and teaming generally has paid more than well. Early in the season a man could get $800 to take 3,000 lbs. to the mines; but prices have been reduced now to $20 to $30 per 100 lbs. Last spring cattle were very high, $2,000 being offered for three yoke and a wagon and refused, very properly too, for two loads would pay it. Now, however, they are cheaper: oxen sell for from $40 to $80 per yoke, and a good wagon $80 to $100.
</p><p>
This change is produced by the number driven in from the States. Mules are in demand at from $125 to $200, and some even $300. I could tell you of men who are taking out from $500 to $1,000 per day, but I could also tell you of men who have labored three months in the mines and have made but little over expenses. There are other ways of making money here besides digging gold: laboring men do well; a man with a good team has a good capital to work on; and mechanics, especially carpenters, do well. The climate, I think, is unhealthy for northern men. There has been much sickness, not only in the mines, but in the country generally; dysentery, blood flux, ague and chill-fever are plenty. These yield readily to proper remedies if taken in season, much the same as in Illinois.--This is about the state of things as they now stand. In the city (Sacramento, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jas" >Sutter's</a> Fort) speculation has become the order of the day; many men have realized fortunes in a few weeks, but that time is passed, for lots have run up far above their value. Lots which sold four months ago for $200 are now held at $10,000. One hotel rents for $1,500 per month, another $1,000; one eating and drinking establishment for $80, and so on. When the rainy season comes on, nearly all the town will be inundated, and they will have to move off towards the Fort till spring. Lots will then fall, I think. In the city the buildings are chiefly made of cloth, so that they can easily be taken down and replaced in the spring. Provisions there are low, all things considered, and they sell in the mines at about 200 per cent. profit, though the advance varies according to the distance and the facilities of getting to the mines. Where I am teams nor mules can go any farther up, and men are at work about ten miles above, but they have to pack their provisions over rocks and passes where no road can be made. The gold found here is very pure; it exists in fine scales, but higher up it is coarser. The dry diggings have not been worked recently, but will be this winter as soon as there is water enough in the ravines to wash with. To those who wish to come I would recommend the route by the Isthmus or around the Cape, for, disagreeable as it may be, they will suffer less than by an overland trip; but whoever comes, let him not think of returning in less than two years, for it will take that time to bring matters around right. I have made something and am getting matters in a train to make more, I hope.
