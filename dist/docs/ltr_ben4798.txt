DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
This Ship, staying longer than was expected, gives me an 
Opportunity of writing to you, which I thought I must have 
missed when I desired Cousin Williams to excuse me to you. 
I receiv'd your kind Letter of September 25th, by the young 
Gentlemen, who, by their discreet Behaviour have recommended themselves very much to me and many of my Acquaintance. Josiah has attained his Heart's Desire, of being 
under the Tuition of Mr. Stanley, who, though he had long 
left off Teaching, kindly undertook, at my Request, to instruct him, and is much pleased with his Quickness of apprehension and the Progress he makes ; and Jonathan appears a 
very valuable young Man, sober, regular, and inclined to Industry and Frugality, which are promising Signs of Success 
in business. I am very happy in their Company. 
</p><p>
As to the Rumor you mention, (which was, as Josiah tells 
me, that I had been deprived of my Place in the PostOffice on 
account of a Letter I wrote to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>,) it might have 
this Foundation, that some of the Ministry had been displeased on my writing such Letters, and there were really 
some Thoughts among them of showing that Displeasure in 
that manner. But I had some Friends, too, who, unrequired 
by me, advis'd the Contrary. And my Enemies were forced 
to content themselves with abusing me plentifully in the Newspapers, and endeavouring to provoke me to resign. In this 
they are not likely to succeed, I being deficient in that Christian Virtue of Resignation. If they would have my Office, 
they must take it. 
</p><p>
I have heard of some great Man, whose Rule it was, with 
regard to Offices, never to ask for them, and never to refuse 
them; to which I have always added, in my own Practice, 
never to resign them. As I told my Friends, I rose to that 
Office through a long Course of Service in the inferior Degrees 
of it. Before my Time, through bad Management, it never 
produced the Salary annexed to it ; and, when I received it, no 
Salary was to be allowed, if the Office did not produce it. 
During the first four Years it was so far from defraying itself, 
that it became nine hundred and fifty Pounds Sterling in Debt 
to me and my Colleague. I had been chiefly instrumental 
in bringing it to its present flourishing State, and therefore 
thought I had some kind of Right to it. I had hitherto executed the Duties of it faithfully, and to the perfect Satisfaction of my Superiors, which I thought was all that should be 
expected of me on that Account. As to the Letters complained of, it was true I did write them, and they were written 
in compliance with another Duty, that to my Country; a 
Duty quite distinct from that of PostMaster. 
</p><p>
My Conduct in this respect was exactly similar to that I 
held on a similar Occasion but a few Years ago, when the 
then Ministry were ready to hug me for the Assistance I 
afforded them of repealing a former revenue Act. My Sentiments were still the same, that no such Acts should be made 
here for America ; or, if made, should as soon as possible be 
repealed ; and I thought it should not be expected of me to 
change my political Opinions every time his Majesty thought 
fit to change his Ministers. This was my Language on the 
occasion ; and I have lately heard, that, though I was thought 
much to blame, it being understood that every man who holds 
an office should act with the ministry, whether agreeable or 
not to his own judgment, yet, in consideration of the goodness 
of my private character (as they were pleased to compliment 
me), the office was not to be taken from me. 
</p><p>
Possibly they may still change their minds, and remove 
me; but no apprehension of that sort will, I trust, make the 
least alteration in my political conduct. My rule, in which I 
have always found satisfaction, is, never to turn aside in public affairs through views of private interest ; but to go straight 
forward in doing what appears to me right at the time, leaving 
the consequences with <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>. What in my younger days 
enabled me more easily to walk upright, was, that I had a 
trade, and that I knew I could live upon little ; and thence 
(never having had views of making a fortune) I was free from 
avarice, and contented with the plentiful supplies my business 
afforded me. And now it is still more easy for me to preserve 
my freedom and integrity, when I consider that I am almost at the end of my journey, and therefore need less to complete 
the expense of it ; and that what I now possess, through the 
blessing of God, may, with tolerable economy, be sufficient 
for me (great misfortunes excepted), though I should add 
nothing more to it by any office or employment whatsoever. 
</p><p>
I send you by this opportunity the two books you wrote 
for. They cost three shillings apiece. When I was first in 
London, about forty-five years since, I knew a person, who 
had an opinion something like your author's. Her name was 
Hive, a printer's widow. She died soon after I left England, 
and by her will obliged her son to deliver publicly, in Salters' 
Hall, a solemn discourse, the purport of which was to prove, 
that this world is the true Hell, or place of punishment for the 
spirits, who had transgressed in a better state, and were sent 
here to suffer for their sins in animals of all sorts. It is long 
since I saw the discourse, which was printed. I think a good 
deal of Scripture was cited in it, and that the supposition was, 
that, though we now remembered nothing of such a preexistent state, yet after death we might recollect it, and remember the punishments we had suffered, so as to be the 
better for them; and others, who had not yet offended, 
might now behold and be warned by our sufferings. 
</p><p>
In fact, we see here, that every lower animal has its enemy, 
with proper inclinations, faculties, and weapons, to terrify, 
wound, and destroy it; and that men, who are uppermost, 
are devils to one another ; so that, on the established doctrine 
of the goodness and justice of the great Creator, this apparent state of general and systematical mischief seemed to demand 
some such supposition as Mrs. Hive's, to account for it consistently with the honour of the Deity. But our reasoning 
powers, when employed about what may have been before our 
existence here, or shall be after it, cannot go far, for want of 
history and facts. Revelation only can give us the necessary 
information, and that, in the first of these points especially, 
has been very sparingly afforded us. 
</p><p>
I hope you continue to correspond with your friends at 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. My love to your children; and believe me 
</p><p>
ever your affectionate brother, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
