SIR, 
</p><p>
I am this moment favored with yours, by the express. I am sorry for the unfortunate issue of 
the day; but from the troops keeping up their spirits, I flatter myself it will still be in our power to retrieve the loss of yesterday. 
</p><p>
I have thought proper, in consequence of the intelligence received this morning, to call the Congress 
together at six o clock. I have the honor to be, with the utmost respect, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
