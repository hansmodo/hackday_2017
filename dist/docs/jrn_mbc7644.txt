Italy, in the Crimea, what did we care ? Only an interesting topic, like any other, to look for in the paper. Now 
you hear of a battle with a thrill and a shudder. It has come home to us ; half the people that we know in the world 
are under the enemy's guns. A telegram reaches you, and you leave it on your lap. You are pale with fright. You 
handle it, or you dread to touch it, as you would a rattle snake; worse, worse, a snake could only strike you. How 
many, many will this scrap of paper tell you have gone to their death? 
</p><p>
When you meet people, sad and sorrowful is the greet ing ; they press your hand ; tears stand in their eyes or roll 
down their cheeks, as they happen to possess more or less self-control. They have brother, father, or sons as the 
case may be, in battle. And now this thing seems never to 
stop. We have no breathing time given us. It can not be so at the North, for the papers say gentlemen do not go into 
the ranks there, but are officers, or clerks of departments. Then we see so many members of foreign regiments among 
our prisoners Germans, Irish, Scotch. The proportion of trouble is awfully against us. Every company on the field, 
rank and file, is filled with our nearest and dearest, who are common soldiers.

Mem Cohen's story to-day. A woman she knew heard her son was killed, and had hardly taken in the horror of it 
when they came to say it was all a mistake in the name. She fell on her knees with a shout of joy. " Praise the 
Lord, my soul! " she cried, in her wild delight. The 
household was totally upset, the swing-back of the pendulum from the scene of weeping and wailing of a few moments before was very exciting. In the midst of this hubbub the hearse drove up with the poor boy in his metallic 
coffin. Does anybody wonder so many women die? Grief and constant anxiety kill nearly as many women at home 
as men are killed on the battle-field. Mem's friend is at the point of death with brain fever; the sudden changes from 
grief to joy and joy to grief were more than she could bear.

A story from New Orleans. As some Yankees passed 
two boys playing in the street, one of the boys threw a handful of burned cotton at them, saying, " I keep this for you"
The other, not to be outdone, spit at the Yankees, and said, " I keep this for you." The Yankees marked the house. 
Afterward, a corporal's guard came. Madam was affably conversing with a friend, and in vain, the friend, who was 
a mere morning caller, protested he was not the master of the house ; he was marched off to prison.

Mr. Moise got his money out of New Orleans. He went to a station with his two sons, who were quite small boys. 
When he got there, the carriage that he expected was not to be seen. He had brought no money with him, knowing he 
might be searched. Some friend called out, "I will lend 
you my horse, but then you will be obliged to leave the children/ This offer was accepted, and, as he rode off, 
one of the boys called out, " Papa, here is your tobacco, which you have forgotten. Mr. Moise turned back and the 
boy handed up a roll of tobacco, which he had held openly in his hand all the time. Mr. Moise took it, and galloped 
off, waving his hat to them. In that roll of tobacco was encased twenty-five thousand dollars.

Henry Nott was killed at Shiloh ; Mrs. Auze wrote to tell us. She had no hope. To be conquered and ruined had 
always been her fate, strive as she might, and now she knew it would be through her country that she would be made 
to feel. She had had more than most women to endure, and the battle of life she had tried to fight with courage, 
patience, faith. Long years ago, when she was young, her lover died. Afterward, she married another. Then her 
husband died, and next her only son. When New Orleans fell, her only daughter was there and Mrs. Auze went to 
her. Well may she say that she has bravely borne her burden till now.

Stonewall said, in his quaint way : " I like strong drink, so I never touch it. May heaven, who sent him to help us, 
save him from all harm! 
</p><p>
My husband traced Stonewall's triumphal career on the map. He has defeated Fremont and taken all his 
cannon; now he is after Shields. The language of the telegram is vague : Stonewall has taken plenty of 
prisoners " plenty, no doubt, and enough and to spare. We can't feed our own soldiers, and how are we to feed 
prisoners ?

They denounce Toombs in some Georgia paper, which I saw to-day, for planting a full crop of cotton. They say he 
ought to plant provisions for soldiers.

And now every man in Virginia, and the eastern part of South Carolina is in revolt, because old men and boys are 
ordered out as a reserve corps, and worst of all, sacred property, that is, negroes, have been seized and sent out to 
work on the fortifications along the coast line. "We are in a fine condition to fortify Columbia !
