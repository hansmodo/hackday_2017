DEAR Sm: I received your letter of the 19th of August, while I was at 
home, on my farm in Albemarle; and there appearing to be no necessity for 
giving it an immediate answer, I delayed it until my return here. 
</p><p>
I was sorry to find that you understood your instructions relative to operations in Florida differently from what we intended. I was satisfied, however,
that you had good reason for your conduct, and have acted in all things orv 
that principle. By supposing that you understood them as we did, I concluded that you proceeded on your own responsibility alone, in which, knowing the purity of your motives, I have done all that I could to justify the- 
measure. I Well knew, also, the misconduct of the Spanish authorities in 
that quarter, not of recent date only. 
</p><p>
Finding that you had a different view of your power, it remains only to do 
Justice to you on that ground. Nothing can be further from my intention 
than to expose you to a responsibility, in any sense, which you did not contemplate. 
</p><p>
The best course to be pursued seems to me to be for you to write a letter to the Department, in which yon \vfH state, that, bay ing. reason to think 
that a difference of opinion existed between you and the Executive, relative 
to the extent of your powers, you thought it due to yourself to state your 
view of them, and on which you acted. This will be answered, so as to 
explain ours, in a friendly manner by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a>, who has very just 
and liberal sentiments on the subject. This will be necessary in the case of 
a call for papers by Congress, or may be. Thus we shall all stand on the 
ground of honor, each doing justice to the other, which is the ground on 
which we wish to place each other. 
</p><p>
I hope that your health is improved, and Mrs. Monroe unites in her best 
respects to Mrs. Jackson. 
</p><p>
&lt; With great respect and sincere regard, 
</p><p>
I am dear Sir, yours, 
</p><p>

Major Gen. A. JACKSON, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, Tennessee.
