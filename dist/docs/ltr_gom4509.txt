Dear Madam, 
</p><p>
I sit down to let you know, that I am in this world, though in a remote part of it. I have heard of you but not 
form you, since I left <a href='/results.php?city=morrisania' rel='city'>Morrisania</a> ; neither have I had the satisfaction to learn, that, of the many letters I have written, 
you have ever received one. It would give me infinite pleasure to hear of my friends, yourself in particular, but 
since it is my lot to know no more than the burthen of general 
report, I must be contented. 
</p><p>
I received great pain from being informed, that you are 
distressed on my account. Be of good cheer, I pray you. I 
have all that happiness, which flows from conscious rectitude. 
I am blessed with as great a portion of health, as usually belongs 
to the share of mankind. Content with what I have, and with 
what I am, I look forward serenely to the course of events, confident that the Fountain of supreme wisdom and virtue will provide for the happiness of his creatures. It gives me pain, that 
I am separated from those I love, but comparing this with 
what thousands suffer, I dare not repine. Let me earnestly 
recommend to you so much of religion, as to bear inevitable 
evils with resignation. I would that it were in my power to 
solace and comfort your declining age. The duty I owe to 
a tender parent demands this of me, but a higher duty has 
bound me to the service of my fellow creatures. The natural indolence of my disposition has unfitted me for the paths of 
ambition, and the early possession of power taught me how 
little it deserves to be prized. Whenever the present storm 
subsides, I shall rush with eagerness into the bosom of private 
life, but while it continues, and while my country calls for the 
exertion of that little share of abilities, which it has pleased 
God to bestow on me, I hold it my indispensable duty to give 
myself to her. 
</p><p>
I know that for such sentiments I am called a rebel, and that such sentiments are not fashionable among the folks you 
see. It is possible, though I hope not, that your maternal tenderness may lead you to wish, that I would resign these 
sentiments. Let me, however, entreat, that you be not concerned on my account. I shall again see you, perhaps the 
time is not far off. I am much distressed for . I sincerely love him, and I fear that we are separated for a long season. 
Pray remember me to him most affectionately, and to my sister. 
She too has been much wounded. The loss of her infant 
must have greatly distressed her ; but perhaps her own expedience may have led her to prize life at its just value, and if 
so, it is a blessing she may not think so estimable, as to wish it 
for her child. Remember me most tenderly to all her little 
infants, to Isaac particularly, who, I am told, has not forgotten me. Poor child, I hope it may be in my power to return his 
attention by the protection of a parent. God forbid that he 
should need it, or any of them. Remember me to Mrs Ashfield and her children, for I think she has more than one. 
I wish her husband had acted more consistently ; but enough 
of this. And now, my dear Madam, let me again entreat 
you to make yourself happy. Discard the gloomy ideas, 
which are too apt to crowd into the mind in your situation 
and time of life. There is enough of sorrow in this world, 
without looking into futurity for it. Hope the best. If it happens, well; if not, it will then be time enough to be afflicted, 
and at any rate the intermediate space will be well filled. 
Adieu. Yours, most affectionately.
