Dear General, 
</p><p>
I was duly honored with your Excellency's favor of the 4th of February, and omitted writing since upon 
a supposition that you had gone to Rhode Island. I 
am happy to find your Excellency entertains the same 
sentiments of the virtues and abilities of Colonel 
Hamilton, as I have ever done myself After I wrote your Excellency, I found the eyes of Congress turned on <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Robert Morris</a>, of this city, as Financier. I did 
not therefore nominate <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague'>Colonel Hamilton</a>, as I foresaw 
it would be but a vain attempt. I shall this day 
nominate him as Secretary of Foreign Affairs, in 
which, I think, I shall meet. the approbation of most 
of the States. 
</p><p>
The choice of a Minister of "War is postponed to 
the first of October. This was a manoeuvre of Samuel 
Adams and others from the north, fearing that, as I 
was in nomination, the choice would fall on me, who, 
having apostatized from the true New England faith, 
'by sometimes voting with the Southern States, am 
not eligible. They were not, however, acquainted with 
all the circumstances. I was nominated against my 
will, and, if chosen, should not have accepted. <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='colleague'>General McDougall</a> is appointed Minister of Marine. The 
plans of finance and all other matters go on so slowly, that I tremble at the consequences. I am mortified at the useless harangues, which consume our time 
to no purpose. I am now endeavouring to obtain an 
adjournment of Congress, and for leaving a Committee 
to transact the business, as the only way of having 
the public business done with propriety and despatch. 
I fully agree with your Excellency, that Congress 
ought to have more power; but I also think that the 
old members should be in Heaven, or at home, before 
this takes place. 
</p><p>
The traffic carried on with the enemy is alarming, 
as it not only serves to furnish them with necessaries, 
but tends to reconcile our citizens to the idea of renewing their connection with Great Britain, and of 
course disaffects them to our government. 
</p><p>
Since <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>'s letter of the 15th of February, we have received advices from <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague'>Governor Jefferson</a>, and divers others, that Cornwallis is retreating, that 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> crossed the river in pursuit of him 
the 21st, and that the militia had collected all round 
him. I hope it is not a manoeuvre to bring <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> to an action. 
</p><p>
I have been settling my accounts with the TreasuryBoard, and find I stand charged with money received 
at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, to pay the bounty to the New Hampshire recruits in <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. All my papers were lost at 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and I can remember little of the matter. 
This I am sure of, that I never received any public 
money, but what I immediately applied to the use 
intended. Perhaps Colonel Harrison has some papers 
which will settle the matter. I also am charged with 
the money paid for the troops engaged at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, 
in December, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. I remember the whole of this 
was settled at <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a> about two months after, and 
I received a receipt in full, which is in New Hampshire. Perhaps your papers may save me the trouble 
of sending for it. I have the honor to be. 
</p><p>
With the highest esteem, dear General, yours, &c.,
