</p><p>
MY DEAR Sm, Your favor of the 9th ultimo has been so 
long on hand unanswered, that I cannot now acknowledge it 
without observ.g, in the apology for the delay, that I waited 
for some measures of which I wished to communicate the event. 
The district bill, of which I formerly made mention, was finally 
thrown into a very curious situation, and lost by a single voice. 
I refer you for its history to Col. Pendleton, who was here at 
the time, and is now with you. An attempt has been since made 
to render the General Court more efficient, by lengthening its 
terms, and transferring the criminal business to the Judges of 
the Admiralty. As most of the little motives which co-operated 
with a dislike to Justice in defeating the District Bill happened 
to be in favour of the subsequent attempt, it went through the 
House of Delegates by a large majority. The Senate have disappointed the majority infinitely in putting a negative on it, as 
we just learn that they have done, by a single voice. An 
amendment of the County Courts has also been lost, through a 
disagreement of the two Houses on the subject. Our merit on 
the score of Justice has been entirely of the negative kind. It 
has been sufficient to reject violations of this cardinal virtue, 
but not to make any positive provisions in its behalf. 
</p><p>
The revised code has not been so thoroughly passed as I 
hoped at the date of my last. The advance of the session, the 
coldness of a great many, and the dislike of some to the subject, 
required that it should be pressed more gently than could be 
^Iconciled with a prosecution of the work to the end. I had 
long foreseen that a supplemental revision, as well of some of 
the articles of the Code as of the laws passed since it was digested, would become necessary, and had settled a plan for the 
purpose with myself. This plan was to suspend the laws adopted 
from the Code until the supplement could be prepared, and 
then to put the whole in force at once. Several circumstances 
satisfied me of late, that if the work was put within the reach of 
the next Assembly, there would be danger not only of its being 
left in a mutilated state, but of its being lost altogether. The 
observ.ions in your favor above acknowledged encouraged 
me to propose that the parts of the Code adopted should take 
effect without waiting for the last hand to it. This idea has 
been pursued, and the bills passed at the last session are to 
commence as then determined, those passed at the present being 
suspended until July next. 
</p><p>
I would myself have preferred a suspension of the former 
also till July, for the sake of a more thorough promulgation, 
and of a cotemporary introduction of the laws, many of which 
are connected together; but the Senate thought otherwise, and 
in a ticklish stage of the session, the friends of the code in the 
House of Delegates joined me in opinion that it would be well 
to create no unnecessary delays or disagreements. I have 
strong apprehensions that the work may never be systematically perfected, for the reasons which you deduce from our 
form of Government. Should a disposition, however, continue 
in the Legislature as favorable as it has been in some stages of 
the business, I think a succession of revisions, each growing 
shorter than the preceding, might ultimately bring a completion 
within the compass of a single session. At all events, the invaluable acquisition of important bills, prepared at leisure by 
skilful hands, is so sensibly impressed on thinking people by 
the crudeness and tedious discussion of such as are generally 
introduced, that the expence of a continued revision will be 
thought by all such to be judiciously laid out for this purpose 
alone. 
The great objection which I personally feel arises from the 
necessity we are under of imposing the weight of these projects 
on those whose past serv.es have so justly purchased an exemption from future labours. In your case, the additional consideration of ill health became almost an affair of conscience, 
and I have been no otherwise able to stifle the remorse of having nominated you, along with Mr. Wythe and Mr. Blair, for 
reviewing the subject left unfinished, than by reflecting that 
your colleagues will feel every disposition to abridge your share 
of the burden, and in case of such an increase of your infirmity 
as to oblige you to renounce all share, that they are authorised 
to appoint to, I will not say to fill, the vacancy. I flatter myself that you will be at least able to assist in general consultations on the subject, and to adjust the bills unpassed to the 
changes which have taken place since they were prepared. On 
the most unfortunate suppositions, my intentions will be sure to 
find in your benevolence a pardon for my error. 
</p><p>
The Senate have saved our commerce from a dreadful blow 
which it would have sustained from a bill passed in the House 
of Delegates, imposing enormous duties, without waiting for the 
concurrence of the other States, or even of Maryland. There 
is a rage at present for high duties, partly for the purpose of 
revenue, partly of forcing manufactures, which it is difficult to 
resist. It seems to be forgotten, in the first case, that in the 
arithmetic of the customs, as Dean Swift observ., 2 and 2 do 
not make four; and in the second, that manufactures will come 
of themselves when we are ripe for them. A prevailing argument, among others on the subject, is, that we ought not to be 
dependent on foreign nations for useful articles, as the event of 
a war may cut off all external supplies. This argument certainly loses its force when it is considered that, in case of a 
war hereafter, we should stand on very different ground from 
what we lately did. Neutral nations, whose rights are becoming every day more and more extensive, would not now suffer 
themselves to be shut out from our ports, nor would the hostile 
Nation presume to attempt it. As far as relates to implements 
of war, -which are contraband, the argument for our fabrication 
of them is certainly good. 
</p><p>
Our latest information from the Eastward has not removed our 
apprehensions of ominous events in that quarter. It is pretty 
certain that the seditious party has become formidable to the 
Government, and that they have opened a communication with 
the viceroy of Canada. I am not enough acquainted with the 
proceedings of Congress to judge of some of the points which 
you advert to. The regulations of their land office have appeared to me nearly in the light in which they do to you. 
</p><p>
I expect to set out in a few days for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, when I shall 
revive my claim to a correspondence which formerly gave me 
so much pleasure, and which will. enable me, perhaps, to answer 
your queries. The end of my paper will excuse an abrupt but 
affectionate adieu.
