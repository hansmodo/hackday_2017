THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, June 29, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>.

My friend, T. H. Perkins, who was here some time since, had already informed me of the discomfiture the Jacobinical heroes had suffered in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, by the loss of Honestus's election.

His Chronicle printer, the Tom Tit twittering on this goose's back, cannot fight, it seems, his little wish to be 
malicious against me. He will not forgive me for having put some truth and justice into his paper. It was such a violence to the personal character of the man, and the politi 
cal character of the print, as would have made him my enemy for ever, if he had dared to be the enemy of any man. 
The American minister neither went to England with the Stadtholder, nor remained at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a> under the protection 
of General Pichegru. He remained at his post under the protection of the Laws of Nations ; that is, of certain usages 
and principles to the printer and editor of the Chronicle unknown, but which all civilized human beings hold in 
singular veneration, and which General Pichegru as well as the other French generals and representatives of the people 
who have been in this country, took particular pains to preserve inviolate. It did not once enter their minds that 
the minister of a neutral and friendly nation could be a subject of protection to them ; but they were anxiously 
solicitous that none of the rights annexed to the character should suffer the minutest injury from them, and strange 
as it may seem to the aforesaid printer and editor, they universally valued very highly the reputation of being scrupulously observant of the laws of nations. . . .
