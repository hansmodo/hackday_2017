SIR I should not have been silent so long, if any important considerations had made writing necessary. In this quarter, much alarm has been created by a new 
court of criminal jurisdiction, which it is said, has lately been opened in Rhode Island. Neither the power, nor the object of this court, have been perfectly understood 
here; but in general, we have understood, that it was designed to put into execution the dangerous advice of 
the two Houses of Parliament in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1769">1769</a>, to seize obnoxious Americans, and convey them to England for trial. 
When our Assembly met lately, they were not furnished with proper documents on this subject. But they have now adopted a measure, which from the beginning, 
they should have fixed on, as leading to that union and perfect understanding with each other, on which the political salvation of America depends. I have enclosed 
you, that part of our Journal, which relates to that matter. You will observe, sir, that full scope is given, to a 
large and thorough union of councils, though our language is so contrived, as to prevent the enemies of 
America, from hurrying this transaction into the vortex of treason, whither they have carried every honest attempt 
to defend ourselves, from their tyrannous designs, to destroy our constitutional liberty. I hope sincerely, that 
every colony on the continent, will adopt these committees of correspondence and inquiry. I should be much 
obliged, sir, with your sentiments on the Rhode Island court, and with the knowledge you have, of its powers and object. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, with great esteem, your most obedient and humble servant,
