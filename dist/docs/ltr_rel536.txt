The weather is now very hard upon our poor bushmen.  This morning
the whole country is covered with a mantle of snow fully a foot deep.
It was nearly up to my knees as I stepped out this morning, and our
poor horses were enveloped.  We have dug them out and opened our avenues
a little, but it will be terrible and the roads impassable.  No cars
from Richmond yesterday.  I fear our short rations for man and horse
will have to be curtailed.  Our enemies have their troubles too.  They
are very strong immediately in front, but have withdrawn their troops
above and below us back toward Acquia Creek.  I owe Mr. F. J. Hooker
[Fighting Joe was Hooker's most popular sobriquet in the Federal
army] no thanks for keeping me here.  He ought to have made up his
mind long ago about what do to--24th.  The cars have arrived and
brought me a young French officer, full of vivacity, and ardent for
service with me.  I think the appearance of things will cool him.  If
they do not, the night will, for he brought no blankets.
