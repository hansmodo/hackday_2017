Dear Brother : Since my return from Jackson, I have 
been very busy every general officer but two has gone 
on furlough, and everybody wants to go. . . . 
</p><p>
The railroad comes within four miles of my tent, and 
I have its exclusive use and a telegraph at my elbow. 
If you come down you will fmjef your name a passport, 
but should that fail you, see (Bi-eneral Grant or McPherson in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>, and they/ will put you through. I 
don't think there is any dagger on the river now unless 
it be on the Ohio, which you can avoid by taking cars to 
Cairo. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> is worih seeing, and a glance will 
tell you more than reams of paper why it took us six 
months to take the place. I am camped near Big Black, 
four and one-half miles northeast of where the railroad 
crosses it. My depot of supplies is at the crossing. 
Col. J. Condit Smith is my quartermaster, and should 
you reach that point before I am advised by telegraph, 
apply to him and he will send you to my camp. I have 
four divisions here much reduced, but still a good stock. 
In the riots of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> I recognize the second stage of 
this war, but I trust our Government will deal with 
them summarily. The war has progressed as fast and 
as successfully as should be. 
</p><p>
Your brother,
