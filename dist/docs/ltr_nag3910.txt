DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
I have just got your letter of this day, dated at Wasmasaw. No 
thing ever surprised me more. I was in the highest hopes you were 
at or near <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>. Mr. Singleton, by whom I wrote, was fully 
informed of the contents of the letter, and the necessity of its being 
delivered with all possible dispatch. He had a letter for Col. Lushington, and promised to have it delivered in <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> the day fol 
lowing the date of your letter, by 10 o clock, and yours I expected 
</p><p>
would have got to you by one in the morning, and you on your march 
before sunrise. Never did I feel such a vexatious disappointment in 
all the course of my life. I beg you will make enquiry into the cause 
of the delay, as you write that mine never got to your hands until this 
morning. Somebody deserves nothing short of hanging. I am afraid 
you will now arrive too late to be of any service, unless the goods should 
be got up the rivers, and your force deter the enemy from following 
them. Since I wrote you, the enemy's intentions have been again con 
firmed by repeated accounts. I need not urge you to use all possible 
dispatch in marching to the relief of the place, as your own zeal will 
stimulate you to do all in your power. I have not heard anything from 
the party that crossed to Haddrell's Point, whether they proceeded or 
not; but, in order to alarm their fears, I made a move in force towards 
James Island, to induce them, if possible, to countermand the order. 
I beg you will let me hear from you respecting the progress the enemy 
has made, and if they have attempted anything, and how far they were 
successful. If the enemy has not made the descent, you will wait in 
the neighborhood of <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> until you hear further from me. I 
consider the disappointment of your not getting my letter the greater, 
as I find your force so respectable, as they appear by your returns. 
I am, sir, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
