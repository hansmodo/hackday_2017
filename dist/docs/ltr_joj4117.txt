Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the friendly congratulations and 
sentiments expressed in your letter of the 14th of this 
month. 
</p><p>
I regret my not knowing that you resided at Bath. We 
passed from Falmouth through that city in our way to this. 
It would have given me pleasure to have called upon you, 
and (to use an Indian expression) have brightened the chain. 
</p><p>
Many great and unexpected events have taken place 
since we parted. We live in times that teem with them. 
A great and wonderful drama is exhibiting on the stage of 
Europe, perhaps of the world. We are spectators of the 
first act. What may succeed, or what the catastrophe will 
be, human prevision cannot discern. 
</p><p>
Peace and domestic comforts rise in value as they become precarious; and individual misery, by abounding, 
produces national distress ; and yet, even in this age of 
reason and philosophy, the passions do not cease to fan the 
flames of war, and cause them to rage, to spread, and to 
desolate. 
</p><p>
If, during my stay here, you should visit London, I shall 
be happy to see you, and to assure you of the esteem and 
regard with which I am 
</p><p>
Your obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
