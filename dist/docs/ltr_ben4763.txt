DEAR POLLEY, 
</p><p>
Agreable to your Orders, delivered to me very punctually 
by Temple, I return you enclosed Voltaire's Verses. The 
Translation I think full as good as the Original. Remember 
that I am to have them again. 
</p><p>
I take this Opportunity to send you, also, a late Paper, containing a melancholy Account of the Distresses of some Seamen. You will observe in it the Advantages they received 
from wearing their Clothes constantly wet with Salt Water, 
under the total Want of fresh Water to drink. You may 
remember I recommended this Practice many years ago. 
Do you know Dr. Len, and did you communicate it to him? 
I fancy his Name is wrong spelt in this Paper, and that it 
should be Lind, having seen in the Review some Extracts 
from a book on Sea- Diseases, published within these 2 or 3 
Years, by one Dr. Lind ; 2 but I have not seen the Book, 
and know not whether such a Passage be in it. 
</p><p>
I need not point out to you an Observation in favour of 
our Doctrine, that you will make on reading this Paper, 
that, having little to eat y these poor People in wet Clothes Day 
and Night caught no Cold. 
</p><p>
My respects to your Aunt, and love to all that love you. 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately, B FRANKLIN _
