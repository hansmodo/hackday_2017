My Dear Brother : Your letter to Mr. Ewing and the 
accompanying letters were carefully read by me and then 
sent to Mr. Ewing. I do not see how your conduct can 
be assailed. I had watched with a very great deal of 
anxiety your movements, and had carefully preserved 
every extract of a paper which related to it, fearing at 
the time a collision between the Vigilant Committee and 
your authority. I must confess that, except as you were 
personally interested in the contest, my sympathies were 
all with the committee. The same class of characters 
who were so infamous in this city and in election frauds 
have controlled the cause of Law and Order in Kansas, 
and there committed such calamities with the direct 
sanction of the authorities that it seemed to me just and 
right to organize and to enforce a higher law. The early 
movements of the people meet the cordial approval of 
all good men here, and this feeling was deepened by the 
act of your representative, Herbert, in killing the Irish 
waiter. If the proclamation of the governor had been 
equally obeyed by the committee, all would have been 
satisfied ; but their continued action subverts all law and 
authority, and it seems to me ought not to be tolerated. 
At first I was surprised that you had taken part in the 
strife, and especially against the committee; but the 
newspapers have contained such full information as to 
your movements that it was manifest that you did right 
in accepting the authority you did, and under the circumstances you could do nothing but resent what they 
did. The papers here take the same view of it, and 
approve the course you pursued, and generally condemn 
General Johnson that he did not observe more moderation in dealing with the committee. As it seems to 
exercise its novel authority wisely and promptly, I hope 
they will expel the worst of their prisoners without further violence, and then gradually dissolve, and allow the 
constituted authorities to resume their usual course. 
The lesson taught them may be of service. 
</p><p>
Affectionately your brother,
