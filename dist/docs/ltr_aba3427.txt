MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
Captain Davis called yesterday to let me know 
that he should sail in the course of the week. Captain Barnard will not be long after him, and I almost wish I was going to embark with him. I think 
I should not feel more anxious if I was in the midst 
of all the disturbances, than I do at this distance, 
where imagination is left at full liberty. When law 
and justice are laid prostrate, who or what is secure ? 
I received your letters, which came by Captain Scott, 
just as I was going to step into the carriage to go into 
the City upon some business. As I was alone, I 
took them with me to read ; and, when I came to that 
part of your letter wherein you say that you had 
hoped to have seen only peace in future, after surmounting the horrors of one war, the idea was too 
powerful for me, and the tears involuntarily flowed. 
I was obliged to quit the letter till I had finished my 
business ; the thoughts which naturally occurred to me 
were, " For what have we been contending against 
the tyranny of Britain, if we are to become the sacrifice of a lawless banditti ? Must our glory be thus 
shorn and our laurels thus blasted ? Is it a trifling 
matter to destroy a government ? Will my countrymen justify the maxim of tyrants, that mankind are 
not made for freedom ? I will, however, still hope 
that the majority of our fellow-citizens are too wise, 
virtuous, and enlightened, to permit these outrages to 
gain ground and triumph. Solon, the wise lawgiver 
of Athens, published a manifesto for rendering infamous all persons who, in civil seditions, should remain spectators of their country's danger by a criminal neutrality. The spirit shown by the gentleman 
volunteers, and the capture of Shattuck, does honor 
to our State. More energy in government would 
have prevented the evil from spreading so far as it 
has done. 
</p><p>
" Mercy but gives sedition time to rally. 
Every soft, pliant, talking, busy rogue, 
Gathering a flock of hot-brained fools together, 
Can preach up new rebellion, 
Spread false reports of the Senate, working up 
Their madness to a fury quick and desperate, 
Till they run headlong into civil discords, 
And do our business with their own destruction." 
</p><p>
This is a picture of the civil dissensions in Rome, 
and to our mortification we find, that human nature 
is the same in all ages. Neither the dread of tyrants, the fall of empires, the havoc and desolation 
of the human species, nor the more gloomy picture 
of civil discord, are sufficient to deter mankind from 
pursuing the same steps which have led others to 
ruin ; selfishness and spite, avarice and ambition, 
pride and a levelling principle, are qualities very unfavorable to the existence of civil liberty. But, whatever is to be the fate of our country, we have determined to come home and share it with you. Congress have never given <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> a recall from 
Holland, and he is vested (with <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='friend met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>) with 
powers to form treaties with several other countries. 
His commission to this Court will terminate this 
time twelve months, and he has written to Congress 
his fixed and full determination to resign his commission and return at that period, if not before. So 
that, my dear sister, I most joyfully accept your invitation, and will come home, God willing, ere 
another year expires. Disagreeable as the situation 
of my native State appears, I shall quit Europe with 
more pleasure than I came into it, uncontaminated, I 
hope, with its manners and vices. I have learned to 
know the world and its value ; I have seen high life ; 
I have witnessed the luxury and pomp of state, the 
power of riches and the influence of titles, and have 
beheld all ranks bow before them as the only shrine 
worthy of worship. Notwithstanding this, I feel that 
I can return to my little cottage, and be happier than 
here ; and, if we have not wealth, we have what is 
better, integrity. 
</p><p>
I bad written you thus far with an intention of 
sending by Davis, but received a card to-day from 
Captain Barnard, that he will sail at the same time, 
which is a fortnight sooner than I expected. I have 
concluded to send by him. I wrote you by Captain Cushing, on board of whom I got Mr. Elworthy to 
put a small present for you, but was much mortified 
a day or two after to find, by a <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> paper, that 
they were prohibited articles. I hope you will not 
meet with trouble on account of them. I cannot but 
approve the spirit which dictated the measure ; the 
causes which gave rise to it must be deplored, for it 
is evidently a work of necessity rather than choice. 
The luxury, which had made such rapid strides 
amongst our countrymen, was more criminal than 
that which is founded upon real wealth, for they have 
rioted upon the property which belonged to others. It 
is a very just observation, that those who have raised 
an empire have always been grave and severe ; they 
who have ruined it have been uniformly distinguished for their dissipation. We shall wait with impatience for the result of <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel=''>General Lincoln</a>'s expedition. 
Much depends upon his success. Government seem 
afraid to use the power they have, and recommend 
and entreat, where they ought to command ; which 
makes me apprehend that the evil lies deeper than 
the heads or hands of Shays or Shattuck. From 
letters received here both from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> and New 
York, it is to be feared that visionary schemes and 
ambitious projects are taking possession of men of 
property and science ; but, before so important an 
edifice as an established government is altered or 
changed, its foundation should be examined by skilful artists, and the materials of which it is composed, 
duly investigated. 
</p><p>
The " Defence of the American Constitutions " is 
a work which may, perhaps, contribute to this end, 
and I most sincerely wish it may do the good intended. 
</p><p>
I lament with you the loss of a worthy man, for 
such indeed was the friend of my dear Eliza. Our 
own duration is but a span ! then shall we meet those 
dear friends and relatives who have gone before us, 
and be engaged together in more elevated views, and 
purer pleasures and enjoyments, than mortality is capable of. Let this idea soothe the afflicted mind, and 
administer balm to the wounded heart. All things 
are under the government of a supreme, all- wise 
Director ; to Him commit the hour, the day, the 
year. 
</p><p>
Affectionately your sister, 
</p><p>
A A.
