</p><p>
April 20, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1862">1862</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Brother : I heartily and with great pride in you 
congratulate you on your escape and for the high honors 
you won in the battle of the 7th and the 8th. Cecilia 
and I have watched with the most anxious interest your 
course and have read every word that was accessible in 
regard to the battle. I need not say that it has been 
with the highest satisfaction. The official report of 
Generals <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant</a> leave nothing to desire except that the information as to your wound in the hand 
is indefinite. From your subsequent operations I infer it 
is not so serious as to disable you. It is a fearful battle, 
and I cannot yet conceive how a general rout was avoided. 
The first accounts gave an exaggerated account of the 
surprise, of whole regiments killed or captured in their 
tents, and of inexcusable carelessness in guarding against 
surprise. 'More recent accounts modify the extent of 
the surprise, but still there is an impression that sufficient care was not taken.] That pickets were not far 
enough advanced or of sufficient force, and that General 
Grant should have been nearer his command. I sincerely 
hope he will be relieved from all blame. I enclose you 
a note to General Patterson. 
</p><p>
The general tone of public sentiment is very hopeful. 
</p><p>
This arises partly from the changed tone of our foreign 
news, and perhaps from the comparative ease of money 
matters under our enormous expenditures. 
</p><p>
The great drawback is on account of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gbm" rel="colleague met">McClellan</a>'s position. Military men of the highest character as well as 
all civilians think he is in a position from which he cannot retreat, and where he must fight under very great 
disadvantage. Still the general feeling is hopeful of the 
success of our arms and the preservation of the Union. 
</p><p>
I still adhere to my conviction that we will demonstrate 
the strength, unity and prosperity of a Republican Government for fifty years to come. Notwithstanding your 
reluctance to mingle in the stirring events of the time, 
it will be your fate to do so and I have entire confidence 
that it will be with success and distinction. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
