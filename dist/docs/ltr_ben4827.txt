DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have now before me your several favours of July 10. 
Aug. 23. and Nov. 5. A long Journey I took in the Summer 
and Autumn, for the Establishment of my Health, prevented 
my answering sooner the two first. I hope the State of your 
Health is also mended by your Retirement into the Country, 
as mine has sensibly been by that Journey.

You have furnished me with a very good additional Argument against the Crown's paying its Governors, viz. "that 
this propos'd Independence is impolitic on the part of the 
Crown, and tends to prejudice its Interest, even considered 
separately from that of the People, as it will prove a strong 
temptation to Governors to hold a Conduct that will greatly 
lessen their Esteem and Influence in the Province, and consequently their Power to promote the Service of the King." 
Indeed the making it a Rule among ourselves that the Governor is to have his Salary from our Assemblies, tho j his 
publick Conduct should be wilfully and maliciously prejudicial to the Province, has the same Tendency; of which the 
Conduct of Governor Barnard, while he was constantly 
and regularly paid [by] us, is a considerable Proof. And 
therefore in my Opinion, if we would have our Power of 
granting the Support operate with any Weight in maintaining 
an Influence with the Governor, it should have been withheld 
from him, & we should withold it in Part or in the Whole 
according to Circumstances, as often as such a Conduct 
appears in any Governor. Otherwise the Power, if in such 
Cases it is not to be used, would seem of very little Importance. And since the Assembly have of late Years, and under 
such great Provocations, never attempted to abridge or withhold the Salary, no Reason appears why the Am? Minister, 
should now think it necessary or adviseable for the Crown 
to take the Payment of its Governor upon itself, unless it be 
with an Intention to Influence him, by witholding it when 
he declines executing arbitrary Instructions ; and then in 
such Cases the People should be sure to compensate him. 
As to procuring here any Change of this Measure, I frankly 
own that I despair of it, while the Administration of American 
Affairs continues in the hands of Lord H. and while by our 
Paying the Duties there is a sufficient American Fund out 
of which such Salaries can be satisfied. The Failure of that 
Fund, would be the most likely means of demolishing the Project.

The Attempt to get the Commissioners exempted from the 
Payment of their Taxes, by an Instruction to the Governor, 
is the most indiscrete Thing, surely, to say nothing of its 
Injustice, that any prudent Government was ever guilty 
of. I cannot think it will be persisted in. I hope it will 
never be comply'd with. If the Supply Bill is duly offered 
without the Clause, I am persuaded it will not long be refused. The Publick must however suffer in the mean time 
by the want of the Supply ; but that will be a good Foundation 
for an Impeachment here. Your Reasonings against the 
Instruction are unanswerable, [and shall appear here just 
before the meeting of Parliament.]

I am glad that Commodore Gambier behav'd in so satisfactory a Manner. His Uncle Mr. Mead, first Commissioner 
of the Customs, is a particular and intimate Friend of mine, 
a Man of great Moderation and Prudence; I knew that 
he gave his Nephew, before he went hence, a great deal 
of good Advice with regard to his Conduct among the 
People of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, for whom he has a great Esteem and 
Regard, having formerly commanded a Frigate stationed 
there; and he is happy to find by your Letter (which I 
communicated to him) that his Advice was so well followed. 
He gave also equally good Advice to your indiscrete Commissioners when they were sent out, but they had not Sense 
enough to follow it, and therefore have been the Authors of 
infinite Mischief. I wonder at the Invention of so improbable 
a Lye, as that I should desire a Place among them, who am 
daily urging the Expediency of their Dissolution. The other 
Calumny you mention, contain'd in an anonymous Letter to 
the Speaker is so weak, that I believe you do not think that 
I ought to take any notice of it.
</p><p>
As to the Agency, whether I am re-chosen or not, and 
whether the Gen. Assembly is ever permitted to pay me or 
not, I shall nevertheless continue to exert myself in behalf 
of my Country, as long, as I see a [Probability] of my being 
able to do it any Service. I have nothing to ask or expect of 
Ministers. I have, thanks to God, a Competency, [for the 
little Time I may expect to live,] and am grown too old for 
Ambition of every other kind but that of leaving a good Name 
behind me.

Your Story of the Clergyman and Proclamation is a Pleasant one. I can only match it with one I had from my Father, 
I know not if it was ever printed. Charles the First ordered 
his Proclamation authorizing Sports on a Sunday to be read 
in all Churches. Many Clergymen comply'd, some refus'd, 
and others hurry'd it thro' as indistinctly as possible. But 
one, whose Congregation expected no such thing from him, 
did nevertheless to their great Surprize, read it distinctly. 
</p><p>
He follow'd it however with the Fourth Commandment, Remember to keep holy the Sabbath Day, and then said, 
"Bretheren, I have laid before you the Command of your King, and the Commandment of your God. I leave it to 
yourselves to judge which of the two ought rather to be observed." With great and sincere esteem, I remain, dear Sir, 
Your most obedient and most humble servant
