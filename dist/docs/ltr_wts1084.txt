Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
The encampment (my last) is now over, and we are 
once more in barracks and to-morrow will commence our 
studies, commencing with Civil Engineering. This year's 
course of study is by far the most important of the four, 
as well as the most interesting, embracing as it does 
Engineering both Civil and Military, the construction of 
fortifications as well as the manner of attacking and defending them, Mineralogy and Geology, Rhetoric, Moral 
Philosophy, International and Common Law, Artillery 
and Infantry Tactics, as well as many other minor 
studies, which the scientific officer requires. When 
these shall have been completed, and the next nine 
months shall have passed away, we will receive diplomas and commissions in the army, and I hope a furlough 
along with them. Of course we look forward with no 
common pleasure to so fruitful a time as that ; indeed, 
every circumstance which marks its approach is duly 
celebrated and remembered; instance, the last night of 
our last encampment.
