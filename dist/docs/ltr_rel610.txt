<p><i>[Biographer's note: My mother continued to improve so much that she did not go that summer
to the Warm Springs.  My father spent most of his time in Lexington,
but rode over to the Baths about once a week.  There was nothing he
enjoyed more than a good long ride on Traveller.  It rested him from
the cares and worries incident to his duties, and gave him renewed
energy for his work.  He was often seen that summer along the eleven
miles of mountain road between Lexington and the Baths.  He made
himself acquainted with the people living near it, talked to them
about their affairs, encouraged and advised them, and always had a
cheery greeting and a pleasant word for them.  The little children
along his route soon became acquainted with the gray horse and his
stately rider.  College reopened the last of September and by October
he had his wife and daughters with him again.  He write to me on
October 18th, trying to help me in my agricultural perplexities: ]</i>

...Am glad to hear that you are well and progressing favourably.  Your
Uncle Smith says, in a letter just received in which he writes of his
difficulties and drawbacks, 'I must tell you that if you desire to
succeed in any matter relating to agriculture you must personally
superintend and see to everything.'  Perhaps your experience coincides
with his.

I hope your wheat will reimburse you for your labour and guano.  I
think you are right in improving your land.  You will gain by cultivating
less and cultivating that well, and I would endeavour to manure every
crop--as to the kind of manure which will be the most profitable, you
must experiment.  Lime acts finely on your land and is more lasting
than guano.  If you can, get shells to burn on your land, or, if not,
shell lime from Baltimore.  I think you would thereby more certainly
and more cheaply restore your fields.  I hope your sale of ship-timber
may place you in funds to make experiments.  You will have to attend
to your contractors.  They will generally bear great attention, and
then circumvent you....  I hope I shall see you this winter, when we
can talk over the matter.  We are pretty well.  Your <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse met">mother</a> is better
by her visit to the Baths.  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mil" rel="child met">Mildred</a> talks of going to the Eastern
Shore of Maryland next month, and I fear will be absent from us all
winter.  I must refer you to your sisters for all news.  They are
great letter-writers, and their correspondence extends over the globe.
Miss Etta Seldon is with us.  All our summer visitors have gone, and
some who, I hoped, would have visited us have not come....  Good-bye,
my dear son.  God bless you....
