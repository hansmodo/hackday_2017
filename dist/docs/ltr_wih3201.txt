DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Yesterday, at half past nine o clock, A. M., I received your orders to march for <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. At twelve, the division began their march ; marched fifteen miles,, 
and halted ; at three, this morning, pursued the march, 
and reached <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> at half past three, P. M. On 
my arrival, I found General Howe had sent off his 
cannon, and his division was filing off towards the 
Highlands. The enemy appeared to be advancing in 
force near the New Bridge. I threw my division in 
the rear, sent Patterson's to the Gorge, and Nixon's, 
Parsons's, and Huntington's to these heights, not being able to get further with the baggage. 
</p><p>
Early in the morning I shall send on the baggage 
into the Highlands, and follow with the troops, giving the enemy an offer of attacking us in rear, if 
they choose it. Sir Henry Clinton is once more disappointed, after marching all day on my flank. Fortutely, I have formed a junction. Since I arrived 
here, I have been honored with yours of yesterday, 
inclosing one to General Glover. Immediately on the 
receipt of your letter, I sent off an express to hurry 
his brigade on, with all possible expedition, by the 
shortest and best route ; and directed the express to 
take fresh horses. I &lt; shall critically observe the motions of the enemy in the morning. I have the 
honor to be, with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
