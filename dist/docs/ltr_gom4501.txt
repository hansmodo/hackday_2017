Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am confident you will not attribute my silence to a want of respect or regard, for I am sure you have a better opinion of me than to imagine I should fail in either towards you. 
In good truth, I know of nothing worth your attention. News 
we have not any, at least not more than the gazettes will promulgate to the listening ear of attentive inquiry. I beg Mr Rivingston's pardon for encroaching on his style. Politics I dislike, and only look on with pity, while the madness of so 
many is made the gain of so few, exclaiming with poor Hamlet, " What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba?" Religion the very word demands respect, and, as B says of his wife, 
</p><p>
I speak of her with reverence. Love as dull as a tale 
twice told. Friendship gone to pay Astraea a visit : her votaries so few that the world knows them not. Business has so transformed, and transmigrated, and almost transubstantiated me, as hardly to leave the memory of what I was. But 
you are not a son of care ; smoothly then may your minutes 
flow. May the table of life be spread before you with uncloying variety ; and chiefly may you be free from that listless 
vacuity of mind, which admonishes us that man was intended 
for an active being. Pray how does that honest man of the heroic age, General Lee ? I suppose he gave a loud plaudit to the Boston wights.

Here follows a word to Mrs Penn. 
</p><p>
Dear Madam, 
</p><p>
What a terrible life do I lead. Worse than at Philadelphia. There I was all night up it is true, but it was in company, making merry. Here up all night writing, and like his 
grace the Duke of C. " nobody with me but myself." Pity 
it is you are not here balls, concerts, assemblies all of us 
mad in the pursuit of pleasure. Not a pause. Grave phizes 
are grinned out of countenance, prudence kicked out of doors, 
and your sober, solid, sedate friend, (myself meaning) is become the butt of unfledged witlings. Mr Griffin is here. 
How does your neighbor's family ? Bless us, what a foolish question. You live at too great a distance to know. Lady 
Dunmore is here a very elegant woman. She looks, and speaks, and moves, and is, a lady. Her daughters are fine, 
sprightly, sweet girls. Goodness of heart flushes from them in every look. How is it possible, said that honest soul our 
Governor to me, how is it possible my Lord Dunmore could so long deprive himself of those pleasures he must enjoy in such 
a family.? When you see them you will feel the full force of this observation. 
</p><p>
Let me beg you to make my respects acceptable to your 
family, and to believe that I am really your friend, 
</p><p>
