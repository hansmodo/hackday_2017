Sir, 
</p><p>
Since I wrote your Excellency on the 9th of December, I have been favored with your despatches 
of the 16th of November, 15th and 19th of December. My letter to Congress, a copy of which I inclose, will inform your Excellency "of the arrival of 
<a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a>, with the Pennsylvania and Mar}land troops. The Virginia officers protested against 
marching until they got their pay, and are still in 
Virginia. Your Excellency's apprehensions were very 
right respecting the diminution of <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a>'s 
command. The Virginia line left us at The same time 
the other came up, which leaves us little stronger 
than we were before. Some reenforcements have arrived lately from York ; it is said, near four hundred 
men. 
</p><p>
Through a good channel of intelligence I got information of troops expected, both from Cork and 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I was so alarmed at it, that I sent off 
Captain Ragsdale to Virginia, and Lieutenant-Colonel 
Stewart to North Carolina, to try to hasten on support, and wrote to <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count Rochambeau</a> for a thousand 
men of his command. But, if more convenient, and 
consistent with the plan you and he had concerted, 
it would be still more agreeable for him to move 
with his whole force this way. Since I sent off those 
despatches, the Cork fleet arrived, without troops, except about sixty artillerymen. I am still under great 
apprehension of troops coming from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, notwithstanding the flattering accounts your Excellency 
gave me. We are in a poor situation to contend with 
a very superior force. Our men are almost naked for 
want of overalls and shirts, and the greater part of 
the army barefoot. We have no rum, or prospect of 
any; none within four hundred miles of us, and little 
or none providing in Virginia ; and if there were 
ever so much there, the difficulty of transportation 
would prevent our getting it, as we were four weeks 
without ammunition since we have been in the lower 
country, and a plenty of this article waiting at Charlotte for the means of transportation. Had the enemy got knowledge, and availed themselves of our 
situation, they might have ruined us. 
</p><p>
I shall, agreeably to your Excellency's direction, 
transmit to the respective States an exact return of 
their troops; and I wish your representation may 
have the desired effect. But the States here have 
been so tardy as to regard representations little more 
than an idle dream or Eastern tale. Nor have I the 
least hopes of our difficulties lessening upon this 
head, until the powers of Congress are more extensive, and the subordination of the States better acknowledged. When any State can be made to feel 
an inconvenience from disobeying a requisition of 
Congress, then, and not till then, can we hope our 
measures will have vigor, and a combination of our 
force take place. We may write till we are blind, 
and the local policy of the States in perfect security, will counteract our wishes. From this very same 
source, I apprehend it impossible to establish matters 
of finance upon such a footing as to answer the public demands. If such of the States as refused or 
neglected to comply with the Congressional requisitions, were deprived of the liberty of trade, either 
foreign or domestic, out of their own State, it might 
serve to fix a little obligation to effect a compliance. 
</p><p>
I perfectly agree "with your Excellency, that we 
should improve every moment this winter, to be in 
readiness to open the campaign to advantage. To be 
well prepared for war, is certainly the most likely 
way of procuring peace. I have recommended to 
this State to raise some black regiments. To fill up 
their regiments with whites is impracticable, and to 
get reenforcements from the northward, precarious, 
and at least difficult, from the prejudices respecting 
the climate. Some are for it, but the far greater 
part of the people are opposed to it. The Assembly 
are now sitting at Jacksonborough, four miles from 
our camp, on the other side of the Edisto. I am, 
with great respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,
