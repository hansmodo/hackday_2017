DEAR FATHER:
</p><p>
It is late at night and I want to get a letter into the mail for you
before it closes. As I have just finished a very hasty letter to Julia
that contains about what I would write, and having something else to
do myself, I will have my clerk copy it.
</p><p>
Day before yesterday, I left here with about 3000 men in five
steamers, convoyed by two gun boats, and proceeded down the river to
within twelve miles of Columbus. The next morning the boats were
dropped down just out of range of the enemy's batteries and the troops
debarked.
</p><p>
During this operation our gun boats exercised the rebels by throwing
shells into their camps and batteries.
</p><p>
When all ready we proceeded about one mile towards Belmont opposite
Columbus; then I formed the troops into line, and ordered two
companies from each regiment to deploy as skirmishers, and push on
through the woods and discover the position of the enemy. They had
gone but a little way when they were fired upon, and the  ball  may be
said to have fairly opened.
</p><p>
The whole command with the exception of a small reserve, was then
deployed in like manner with the first, and ordered forward. The order
was obeyed with great alacrity, the men all showing great courage. I
can say with gratification that every Colonel without a single
exception, set an example to his command that inspired a confidence
that will always insure victory when there is the slightest
possibility of gaining one. I feel truly proud to command such men.
From here we fought our way from tree to tree through the woods to
Belmont, about two and a half miles, the enemy contesting every foot
of ground. Here the enemy had strengthened their position by felling
the trees for two or three hundred yards and sharpening the limbs,
making a sort of abattis. Our men charged through making the victory
complete, giving us possession of their camp and garrison equipage,
artillery and everything else.
</p><p>
We got a great many prisoners. The majority however succeeded in
getting aboard their steamer and pushing across the river.
</p><p>
We burned everything possible and started back, having accomplished
all that we went for and even more. Belmont is entirely covered by the
batteries from Columbus and is worth nothing as a military position.
It cannot be held without Columbus.
</p><p>
The object of the expedition was to prevent the enemy from sending a
force into Missouri to cut off troops I had sent there for a special
purpose, and to prevent reinforcing Price.
</p><p>
Besides being well fortified at Columbus their numbers far exceed
ours, and it would have been folly to have attacked them. We found the
Confederates well-armed and brave. On our return, stragglers that had
been left in our rear,  now front , fired into us, and more recrossed
the river and gave us battle for fully a mile and afterwards at the
boats when we were embarking. There was no hasty retreating or running
away. Taking into account the object of the expedition the victory was
most complete. It has given me a confidence in the officers and men of
this command, that will enable me to lead them in any future
engagement without fear of the result. General McClernand--(who by the
way acted with great coolness throughout, and proved that he is a
soldier as well as statesman)--and myself each had our horses shot
under us. Most of the field-officers met with the same loss, besides
nearly one third of them being killed or wounded themselves. As nearly
as I can ascertain our loss was about 250 killed, wounded, and
missing.
</p><p>
I write in great haste to get this in the office tonight.
</p>
U.S. GRANT.
