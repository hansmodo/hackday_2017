HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, WASHINGTON, May 25, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1846">1846</a>
</p><p>
SIR:
</p><p>
Your letter of this date, received at about 6 p.m., as I sat down to take a hasty plate of soup, demands a prompt reply.
</p><p>
You have taken four days to reflect and to convict me upon my letter to you of the 21st instant, of official, perhaps personal disrespect to the constitutional commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the U. States.
</p><p>
If you have succeeded in imparting that impression to the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">President</a>, then, by the conclusion of your letter, written in his behalf, I am placed under very high obligations to his magnanimity, -- may I not add, to his kindness? -- in not placing me instantly in arrest, and before a general courtmartial. I may then hope that the President saw no such intended disrespect, and I can assure you both that I feel too great a deference to the constitution and laws of my country, to offer or to design an indignity to our chief magistrate.
</p><p>
The strongest passages in my condemned letter, are, I think, hypothetical. In it, I spoke of "impatience" -- "perhaps in high quarters;" of, "perhaps utter condemnation, in the quarters alluded to;" of the "infinite importance of securing myself against danger (ill-will or pre-condemnation) in my rear," and that "most perilous of all positions," to any commander -- "a fire upon (his) rear from Washington, and the fire in front, from the Mexicans." And I also spoke of the necessity of "the active, candid and steady support of (such commander's) government," -- in the hope of conciliating it.
</p><p>
Now if there be any offence to the President, in these passages -- the intention of committing which I utterly disclaim -- it must, in candor, be found in the meaning of the passages -- "high quarters," and "the quarters alluded to," which qualify all the others quoted by you.
</p><p>
It will be perceived that I spoke not of the highest quarter, but in the plural, "high quarters," and I beg as an act of justice, no less to myself than the President, to say -- I meant "impatience" and even "pre-condemnation" on your part, and the known, open and violent condemnation of me on the part of several leading friends and supposed confidents of the President in the two houses of Congress (high quarters!) because, on an intimation-not an order -- I did not fly to the Rio Grande, without waiting for the invading army, yet to be raised -- nay abandoning it to get to that river as it could; and without the least regard to the honorable pride and distinction of the gallant general already in command on that river -- who, we know, had done well, was doing well, and who, I was quite sure, and his little army, would, if the occasion offered -- cover themselves with glory. My prediction, in this respect, has been fully accomplished.
</p><p>
But that I did fear, and meant to express the fear, in my hasty letter of the 21st, that those persons, here enumerated, would, sooner or later,
 
(during the unavoidable long inactivity of the rainy season) impart their pre-condemnation of me, to the President, I will not deny. My letter was written, in part, to guard both the President, and myself against such a result, which would have been fatal, not only to me; but, perhaps, for a campaign, to the service of the country. Hence the details I entered into to show the President and the Secretary of War -- neither supposed to be professionally experienced in the technical preliminaries of a campaign -what had been, and what would continue for some days -- my incessant occupations. There is no special pleading in this explanation. It is written and offered in good faith -- in proof of which I beg to refer to my letter to you of this date  -- sent in, three hours before the reception of that to which I am now replying.
</p><p>
You speak of my interviews with the President on the subject of the intended formidable invasion of Mexico. I wish I had the time to do justice to my recollection of the President's excellent sense, military comprehension, patience and courtesies, in those interviews. I have since, often spoken of the admirable qualities he displayed, on those occasions, with honor, as far as it was in my power to do him honor.
</p><p>
And to you, sir, allow me to say that I have not accused you, and do not mean to accuse you, of a set purpose to discredit me as the commander at first designed for the new army that is to invade Mexico. I bear in mind, with pleasure, the many personal courtesies that I have, for long years, received at your hands. But I have, for many days, believed, that you have allowed yourself to be influenced, against me, by the clamor of some of the friends to whom I have alluded. To that source, and from no ill-will of your own, I have feared that you have not made, and were not likely to make, the just and easy explanations in my behalf which might be made. You are also aware of other causes of uneasiness I have against the department; -- of the want of that confidence and support necessary to my official position -whether here, or on the Rio Grande. I have heretofore explained myself on those points which renders repetition unnecessary.
</p><p>
Whether it shall be the pleasure of the President to send me to the Rio Grande (which I should prefer) or to retain me here, I can only say I am equally ready to do my duty in either position, with all my zeal and all my ability.
</p><p>
In great haste, I have the honor to remain, yr most obt. servt, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="me">WINFIELD Scott</a>
</p><p>
Hon. W. L. Marcy, Sec. of War.
