MAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER, Commanding.

MY DEAR SIR:--When I wrote on the 7th, I had an impression that
possibly by an early movement you could get some advantage from the
supposed facts that the enemy's communications were disturbed and
that he was somewhat deranged in position. That idea has now passed
away, the enemy having re-established his communications, regained
his positions, and actually received reinforcements. It does not now
appear probable to me that you can gain anything by an early renewal
of the attempt to cross the Rappahannock. I therefore shall not
complain if you do no more for a time than to keep the enemy at bay
and out of other mischief by menaces and occasional cavalry raids, if
practicable, and to put your own army in good condition again.
Still, if in your own clear judgment you can renew the attack
successfully, I do not mean to restrain you. Bearing upon this last
point, I must tell you that I have some painful intimations that some
of your corps and division commanders are not giving you their entire
confidence. This would be ruinous, if true, and you should
therefore, first of all, ascertain the real facts beyond all
possibility of doubt.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p>
