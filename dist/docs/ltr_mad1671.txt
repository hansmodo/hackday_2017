DEAR SIR, Although your last favor of the 27 February djoes 
not require any particular answer, I cannot let this occasional 
correspondence drop without thanking you for so interesting a 
supplement to your former remarks on the subject lately decided 
in the House of Representatives. It not only gives me pleasure, but strengthens my conviction, to find my sentiments ratified by those of enlightened and disinterested judges. If we 
are to take for the criterion of truth a majority of suffrages, 
they ought to be gathered from those philosophical and patriotic citizens who cultivate their reason apart from every scene 
that can- disturb its operations, or expose it to the influence of 
the passions. The advantage enjoyed by public bodies in the 
light struck out by the collision of debate is but too often overbalanced by the heat proceeding fe-om the same source. Many 
other sources of involuntary error might be added. It is no 
reflection on Congress to admit for one the united voice of the 
place where they may happen to deliberate. Nothing is more contagious than opinion, especially on questions which, being susceptible of very different glosses, beget in the mind a distrust of 
itself. It is extremely difficult, also, to avoid confounding the 
local with the public opinion, and to withhold the respect due to 
the latter from the fallacious specimen exhibited by the former. 
Without looking, therefore, beyond innocent causes of fallibility, 
I can retain the sentiments which produced the late motion,* 
notwithstanding the disproportion of members by which it was 
outvoted; especially when I can fortify them with such reflections as your two favors have communicated. Indeed, it seems 
scarcely possible for me ever to be persuaded that there is not 
something radically immoral, and consequently impolitic, in suffering the rewards due for the most valuable of all considerations, the defence of liberty, to be transferred from the gallant 
earners of them to that class of people who now take their 
places. It is equally inconceivable, if the new Constitution 
was really calculated to attain more perfect justice, that an exposition of it can be right which confirms and enforces the most 
flagrant injustice that ever took place under the old.

* To divide the payment of the public debt between the original and purchasing holders of certificates. 
I must add my thanks for the little pamphlet covered by your 
last. I have for some time been a thorough believer in the doctrine which it exemplifies, and am not unapprized of the obligation which, in common with other proselytes, I am under to the 
lessons of your pen.
