An unusual number of visitors called this morning, and among them many members of Congress. With but few exceptions they were all on the business of seeking office for their friends. I closed my office at twelve o'clock and disposed of a part of the business on my table. I saw Senators Benton and Dix and informed them that I would send a message to Congress on tomorrow recommending the increase of the regular army and the appointment of a general officer to take command of the army. Mr. Buchanan called, and suggested some modifications in the message which I had prepared on the subject. After night several members of Congress called.
