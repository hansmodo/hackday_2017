Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last was of the twentieth of October. Captain Culver 
did not, I find, get out of the port of Havre till the first instant. 
He took with him the medal dies. 
</p><p>
The Consul charges me with- a balance of nineteen hundred 
and ninety-three livres, eight deniers, nine sous, telling me, that 
bethinks, by your letters, that you would choose that he should 
draw on you, but that it would be very difficult, and therefore 
prefers receiving payment from me. I shall accordingly ad 
vance this sum ; and, as I understand from Captain Culver that 
he paid a considerable part of the disbursement for his vessel 
by dollars sold at twelve livres, I suppose that the owners 
of the vessel will charge you for the whole, to wit, five thou 
sand seventy-three livres, eight deniers, nine sous, at that rate 
being one hundred sixty-six dollars and seventy-nine cents. 
Wherefore, I will carry to the debit of the United States 
the sum above mentioned at the same rate, being one hundred sixty-six dollars and eleven cents, so that you will owe 
only two hundred fifty-six dollars and sixty-eight cents to them. 
</p><p>
In my last, I had the honor to inform you, that the rate of 
depreciation had continued nearly about what it was on the 
twelfth of September, viz. two and a half to three for one. But, 
since that time, it has been approaching, at first gradually, and 
now rapidly, to par. When I left Paris, two days ago, gold 
was at about one and a half, and silver at about one and one 
tenth. The reason of this difference will go far to explain the 
phenomenon of a paper money rising in value, while the sum 
emitted goes on increasing. Gold is more easily concealed 
than silver. Whatever is discovered hidden is confiscated, and 
that which is not hidden is taken to the treasury, to be paid in 
Assignats at par hereafter. 
</p><p>
There is, however, another reason ; the war tax on the rich, 
added to the other taxes, disables them from placing their contingent of the forced loan, and therefore they are reduced to 
the necessity of selling what they possess most valuable, and 
the treasury, which can alone purchase with safety, fixes its 
own price. If, therefore, louis d ors should at length be under 
par, I should not be surprised. The sum of precious metals 
and materials in the treasury and mint is already very great ; 
(they say a milliard., or forty millions sterling) ; it is, I sup 
pose, exaggerated, but it is daily increasing. And. at the rate 
things go on, government will have accumulated in the city of 
Paris all the gold and silver, and a great part of the diamonds, 
pearls, &ic. of France. Of course, they will be in a condition 
to dismiss the Assignats from all farther employment, and to 
begin a new system full handed. 
</p><p>
They seern to think that, in this way, provision will be made 
for two campaigns, and that their enemies, astonished at such 
an immense resource, will be inclined to treat. A previous 
difficulty is, however, to be removed ; that is to say, some one 
person, or some small number of persons, must be named, who 
shall hold the unlimited power of treating and of executing the 
treaty. This will, I suppose, be speedily effected. It will re 
main to be discovered, whether those who are so sanguine, as 
to the dispositions of some, if not all of the Allied Powers, do 
not reckon without their host. 
</p><p>
I must, by the way, drop one word as to the overthrow of 
the Catholic religion. It is now expiring under wounds from 
the true French weapon, ridicule. The people who, five 
years since, fell down in the dirt as the consecrated matter 
passed by, now dance the carmagnole in holy vestments, and 
perform other mummeries, which it might seem profane to 
mention. The late Feast of Reason is a very striking feature 
in the countenance of the revolution. You know the opera 
girl, Saunier, who is, though very beautiful, next door to an ideot, as to her intellectual gifts. It is said also that she is 
anything, except what the French call sage. It is she, who 
lately asked the painter, David, to invent for her (to appear in 
the Ballet of Paris) some dress which should be more indecent 
than nakedness. And the painter, it seems, had genius 
enough to comply with her wish. But I speak only from hear 
say, not having been at any of the theatres for nearly two 
years. 
</p><p>
Well, Sir, it so happened that this actress, remarkable for 
fine attitude in dancing, was pitched upon to represent Reason 
in a kind of opera performed at Notre Dame. In the course 
of it, she stood in the place ci-devant most holy, and was 
there adored on bended knees by the President of the Convention, and other principal characters. At this spectacle, the 
devout will unquestionably be scandalized, and it seems, in effect, to be a strong experiment on the national feelings. The 
burning of legs, and arms, and grinders of saints, male and female, with relics from the wood of the original cross, must 
have the good effect of undeceiving those, who imagined there 
were miraculous qualities inherent in those crumbling materials. But the dismission of all the bishops and curates is a 
matter of more serious import. A national economy of near 
four millions sterling will be thereby effected ; but what degree of ferment may be excited by the disbanding of those 
ecclesiastical regiments, is yet a problem. 
</p><p>
I now proceed to state to you the grounds, on which different advocates erect their fabric of probabilities. To begin 
with those who calculate on the success of France. They 
say, that along the northern frontier from the ocean to the Ardennes, the campaign is null. That the enemy must winter in 
his own country, which, not being covered by fortresses or by 
natural defences, must be open to incursion all winter. That 
the army in Alsace, if Landau and Strasbourg be not taken, 
will find it difficult to retreat, and impossible to stay ; so that 
a Burgoynade may ensue. That from the falls of the Rhine 
to the Mediterranean, the untouched frontier is now guarded 
by impassable snows in the gorges of the Alps, leaving the re 
public in quiet possession of Savoy. That Toulon will soon 
be attacked with such vigor that it must fall. That the Pyrenean mountains now render all attempts on the part of Spain 
abortive. And that the flame kindled in the Vendee must be 
speedily extinguished, so that they will be able with undivided 
energy to oppose, nay attack, their enemies next spring, should 
they persist in hostility, and hence is adduced the probability 
of a peace, on such terms as France may dictate. , 
</p><p>
On the other hand, it is said, that Valenciennes and other adjacent places will cover the heart of Flanders and open that of 
France. That the sluices, especially in winter, form a sufficient defence for the maritime Flanders, and that a great superiority of cavalry will enable the enemy to lay waste Picardy, as 
soon as the French troops shall leave the field and go into winter 
quarters ; that Landau will be taken and Strasbourg surrendered, as it has neither garrison nor magazines ; in which case Alsace is irrecoverably lost, and the enemy, who can occupy the 
passes of the Vosges, will have an easy task to enter Champaign next spring ; that in the mountains of Franche Comte a 
second Vendee is preparing, and waits only the favorable 
moment to break out; that the Lyonese are impatient under 
the yoke, to which they have been compelled to submit, and 
will, of course, take arms whenever an opportunity offers ; that 
Toulon cannot be taken by a coup de main, and the same 
causes, which render the Alps and Pyrenees secure for the 
French, give like security to Spain, and Sardinia, wherefore 
their troops can go to Toulon ; that a numerous French army 
cannot long be subsisted there, in as much as the great city of 
Marseilles was formerly supplied from the coast ofBarbary; 
and thence it is inferred, that, the attempt on Toulon failing, 
Provence must fall, because the French troops must retire to 
a more plentiful country, so the durance will cover the pos 
session of the enemy, and enable him to turn his attention to 
wards Cevennes, in which there exists great discontent and strong 
dispositions for revolt; that should the Franc Comtois engage 
heartily in the royal cause, the Swiss may be brought into the 
league, and, pressing towards Lyons as soon as the campaign 
opens, oblige the French to retire from Savoy, and perhaps to 
abandon all to the eastward of the Rhone ; but at any rate, to 
hold a precarious possession of it until the troops, which winter in Piedmont, can advance into Dauphine. I believe that, 
on almost any hypothesis, it must be admitted that the Dauphinois can dispose of their own country. 
</p><p>
It is contended further, that the insurgents in the Cevennes 
and Auvergne could easily overrun the country along the Garonne and as far as Bordeaux, because the people are already indisposed, and only kept under by the fear of instant 
death. 
</p><p>
On the Vendee much is said. Fire and sword have been 
carried through that unhappy country ; of course, the proselytes 
made will return to their original sentiments, as soon as the 
incumbent terror is removed. It is here that the strong principle of religious fanaticism is to be calculated on. The future conduct cannot be defined, or even conjectured, on the 
ground of reason merely human. The firm persuasion, that 
death in the cause of God gives immediate possession of an 
endless beatitude, is capable of converting timidity into hero 
ism. Already the effects have been wonderful, and we ob 
serve that very few of the men, who have been sent to subdue 
the Vendee, have ever returned. 
</p><p>
A large party, which, at the lowest estimation, is not less 
than 15,000, have crossed the Loire, and marched into Lower 
Normandy and Brittany. That in this quarter they will find 
many congenial spirits is considered as certain, and also that 
their measures are combined with the British cabinet. At a 
distance from their home, nothing remains for them but victory 
or death. It is in this quarter, that the destruction of the 
Catholic religion is supposed to be most obnoxious. The 
clergy being driven to despair,. it is supposed that such of them 
as possess personal courage will march in the ranks. The 
insurgents are commanded by able men ; and the troop is com 
posed of the remnant of many battles. Hence it is concluded, 
that no opposition made to them by the raw levies from Nor 
mandy and Brittany can have any effect, and, of course, that 
the troops in the Vendee must go in pursuit of them. It is 
averred that in such case, the Vendee would rise, like a 
Phoenix from its ashes, more formidable than ever. That there 
is a corps of 12,000 men still remaining on the island of Noirmoutier and that neighborhood, which will come forward im 
mediately and recover all that has been lost and more. 
</p><p>
Lastly, it is said, that however splendid may be the financial 
arrangements, it will be impossible to hold out, unless the people can be taught to eat silver and gold, for that famine already 
partially felt must become general. This assertion is exaggerated, but I think much distress will be experienced on that 
account. 
Having thus given you the pros and cons, I leave you to 
make up your judgment. For my own part, I have observed 
that mankind are generally deceived both by their hopes and 
by their fears; and I persist in believing, that the fate of so 
great a country as this must ever depend much more upon 
interior sentiment, than on exterior operations. As to the 
operations of the insurgents, who are supposed to have in view 
either the town of St Malo, or an irruption into Normandy, or 
a march to Paris, I consider the last as the easiest and safest 
operation ; among other reasons, because it appears most difficult and hazardous. But I do not believe it will be attempted. 
</p><p>
The second, which would look like a serious combination to 
terminate the war, by re-establishing the monarchy, seems to 
me somewhat beyond the degree of talents, which has hitherto 
directed the Allies ; and, on the whole, I conclude that Britain, 
looking with an eye of cupidity at the port of Brest, wishes to 
get possession of St Malo, and extend a defensive line along 
the Ranee and Vilaine rivers, so as to include Lower Brittany, 
and try what can be done by force and persuasion towards the 
possession of that country. Whether this be the plan is one 
question. Whether it will succeed is another. Time will, 
discover the answer to one, and, perhaps, to both. I am, &LC.
