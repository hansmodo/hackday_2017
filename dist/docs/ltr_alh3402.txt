Your favour of the eighteenth, from <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, reached me yesterday Your pronouncing <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a> among 
the other forts, indefensible, surprises me a little, as it is 
entirely contrary to the representations of several gentlemen of judgment, who have had an opportunity of seeing 
and considering its situation, by whom we have been taught 
to believe that it would be an excellent post, at least for 
checking and retarding Burgoyne's progress. I agree with 
you that our principal strength in the quarter you are, will 
be in the forests and natural strength of the country, and in 
the want of forage, provisions, carriages, &c. in which the 
enemy may easily be thrown, by taking away what there 
are of those articles which you observe have never been in 
great abundance. 
</p><p>
I am doubtful whether Burgoyne will attempt to penetrate far, and whether he will not content himself with harassing our back settlements by parties, assisted by the savages, who, it is to be feared, will pretty generally be 
tempted by the enemy's late successes, to confederate in 
hostilities against us. 
</p><p>
This doubt arises from some appearances that indicate a 
southern movement of General Howe's army, which if it 
should really happen, will certainly be a barrier agains: 
any further impressions of Burgoyne ; for it cannot be supposed he would be rash enough to plunge into the bosom of 
the country without an expectation of being met by General Howe. Things must prove very adverse to us indeed, should he make such an attempt and not be ruined 
by it. I confess, however, that the appearances I allude 
to do not carry a full evidence in my mind ; because they 
are opposed by others of a contradictory kind, and because 
I cannot conceive upon what principle of common sense or 
military propriety Howe can be running away from Burgoyne to the southward. 
</p><p>
It is much to be wished he may, even though it should 
give him the possession of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, which, by our remoteness from it may very well happen. In this case we 
may not only, if we think proper, retaliate, by aiming a 
stroke at New- York ; but we may come upon him with the 
greatest part of our collective force, to act against that 
part which is under him. We shall then be certain that 
Burgoyne cannot proceed, and that a small force of continental troops will be sufficient for that partizan war which 
he must carry on the rest of the campaign. 
</p><p>
A small force will also be sufficient to garrison the posts 
in the Highlands, and prevent any danger there ; so that 
we shall be able to bring nearly the whole of the continental army against Mr. Howe. The advantages of this are 
obvious. Should he be satisfied with the splendour of his 
acquisition, and shut himself up in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, we can 
ruin him by confinement. Should he leave a garrison 
there, and go forward, we can either fall upon that or his 
main body, diminished as it will be by such a measure, 
with our whole force There will, however, be many disagreeable consequences attending such an event ; amongst 
which, the foremost is, the depreciation of our currency, 
which, from the importance in which <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> is held, 
cannot fail to ensue.

Your most obedient servant,
