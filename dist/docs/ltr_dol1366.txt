I have received all your letters, my dearest <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="sibling met">Anna</a>, one from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, in which my 
dear brother adds his mite of amusement for Madison and myself, with one from 
your own house. I rejoice more in the last ; the former frightened me a little, but 
we hope from the public prints that we shall not be quite outdone by the Federalists this time. We are still in Orange, 
and shall not leave it before the gth or loth. I have been very ill since I wrote 
last, with inflammatory rheumatism ; never had I more extreme pain in sickness. Dr. Willis bled me, and Mother Madison 
nursed, and waited upon me with great at tention and kindness. We have had a 
continual round of company, which has been burdensome, though I've had no 
trouble with it ; the day I was most ill, fifteen or twenty of the family and connection dined here, and I did not quit my bed, 
or know anything about them. I have a long letter from the Marchioness d Yrujo, 
who speaks of you like a good friend. Ah ! my dear, you little know the triumph 
I feel when I hear of you and your be loved husband in the way that so many 
speak of you ! If Payne was a man, married, and gone from me, I could not feel 
more sensibly everything that regarded him than I do for you both. Stuart has 
taken an admirable likeness of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="spouse met">Mr. Madison</a> ; both his and mine are finished. 
</p><p>
Devotedly yours,
