DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Agreeable to your request, and my promise, I sit down to 
give you my ideas of the defects of our present system, and 
the changes necessary to save us from ruin. They may, 
perhaps, be the reveries of a projector, rather than the sober 
view's of a politician. You w r ill judge of them, and make 
what use you please of them. 
</p><p>
The fundamental defect is a want of power in congress. 
It is hardly worth while to show in what this consists, as it 
seems to be universally acknowledged ; or to point out how 
it has happened, as the only question is how to remedy it. 
It may, however, be said, that it has originated from three 
causes, an excess of the spirit of liberty, which has made 
the particular states show a jealousy of all power not in 
their own hands ; and this jealousy has led them to exercise 
a right of judging, in the last resort, of the measures recommended by congress, and of acting according to their own 
opinions of their propriety or necessity; a diffidence in 
congress of their own powers, by which they have been 
timid and indecisive in their resolutions ; constantly making 
concessions to the states, till they have scarcely left themselves the shadow of power ; a want of sufficient means 
at their disposal to answer the public exigencies, and of 
vigour to draw forth those means, which have occasioned 
them to depend on the states, individually, to fulfil their engagements with the army ; the consequence of which has 
been to ruin their influence and credit with the army, to 
establish its dependence on each state, separately, rather 
than on them ; that is, than on the whole collectively. 
</p><p>
It may be pleaded that congress had never any definitive 
powers granted them, and of course could exercise none, 
could do nothing more than recommend. The manner in 
which congress was appointed would warrant, and the public good required, that they should have considered themselves as vested with full power to preserve the republic 
from harm. 
</p><p>
They have done many of the highest acts of sovereignty, 
which were always cheerfully submitted to ; the declaration of independence, the declaration of war, the levying 
an army, creating a navy, emitting money, making alliances 
with foreign powers, appointing a dictator, &c. &c. ; all 
these were implications of a complete sovereignty, were 
never disputed, and ought to have been a standard for the 
whole conduct of administration. Undefined powers are 
discretionary powers, limited only by the object for which 
they were given ; in the present case, the independence 
and freedom of America. The confederation made no 
difference ; for as it has not been generally adopted, it had 
no operation. 
</p><p>
But, from what I recollect of it, congress have even descended from the authority which the spirit of that act gives 
them ; while the particular states have no farther attended 
to it, than as it suited their pretensions and convenience. 
It would take too much trouble to enter into particular instances ; each of which, separately, might appear inconsiderable, but united are of serious import. I only mean to 
remark, not to censure. 
</p><p>
But the confederation itself is defective, and requires to 
be altered ; it is neither fit for war, nor peace. The idea 
of an uncontrollable sovereignty in each state, over its internal police, will defeat the other powers given to congress, and make our union feeble and precarious. There 
are instances, without number, where acts necessary for 
the general good, and which rise out of the powers given 
to congress, must interfere with the internal police of the\ 
states ; and there are as many instances in which the particular states, by arrangements of internal police, can effectually, though indirectly, counteract the arrangements 
of congress. You have already had examples of this, for 
which I refer you to your own memory. 
</p><p>
The confederation gives the states, individually, too much 
influence in the affairs of the army ; they should have nothing to do with it. 
</p><p>
The entire formation and disposal of our military forces 
ought to belong to congress. It is an essential cement of 
the union ; and it ought to be the policy of congress to destroy all ideas of state attachments in the army, and make 
it look up wholly to them. For this purpose, all appointments, promotions, and provisions whatsoever, ought to be 
made by them. It maybe apprehended, that this may be 
dangerous to liberty. But nothing appears more evident to 
me, than that we run much greater risk of having a weak 
and disunited federal government, than one which will be 
able to usurp upon the rights of the people. 
</p><p>
Already some of the lines of the army would obey their 
states in opposition to congress, notwithstanding the pains 
we have taken to preserve the unity of the army. If any 
thing would hinder this, it would be the personal influence 
of the General a melancholy a nd mortifying consideration. 
The forms of our state constitutions must always give them 
great weight in our affairs, and will make it too difficult to 
blind them to the pursuit of a common interest, too easy to 
oppose whatever they do not like, and to form partial combinations, subversive of the general one. There is a wide 
difference between our situation and that of an empire under one simple form of government, distributed into counties, provinces, or districts, which have no legislatures, but 
merely magistratical bodies to execute the laws of a common sovereign. Here the danger is, that the sovereign will 
have too much power, and oppress the parts of which it is 
composed. In our case, that of an empire composed of confederative states, each with a government completely organized within itself, having all the means to draw its subjects to a close dependence on itself, the danger is directly 
the reverse. It is, that the common sovereign will not have 
power sufficient to unite the different members together, and 
direct the common forces to the interest and happiness of 
the whole. 
</p><p>
The leagues among the old Grecian republics are a proof 
of this. They were continually at war with each other, and 
for want of union fell a prey to their neighbours. They frequently held general councils, but their resolutions were no 
farther observed, than as they suited the interests and inclinations of all the parties, and, at length, they sunk entirely 
into contempt. 
</p><p>
The Swiss cantons are another proof of the doctrine. 
They have had wars with each other, which would have 
been fatal to them, had not the different powers in their 
neighbourhood been too jealous of one another, and too 
equally matched, to suffer either to take advantage of their 
quarrels. That they have remained so long united at all, 
is to be attributed to their weakness, to their poverty, and 
to the cause just mentioned. These ties will not exist in 
America. A little time hence, some of the states will be 
powerful empires ; and we are so remote from other nations, that we shall have all the leisure and opportunity we 
can wish to cut each other's throats. 
</p><p>
The Germanic corps might also be cited as an example 
in favour of the position. 
</p><p>
The United Provinces may be thought to be one against 
it. But the family of the Stadtholders, whose authority is 
interwoven with the whole government, has been a strong 
link of union between them. Their physical necessities, 
and the habits founded upon them, have contributed to it. 
Each province is too inconsiderable by itself to undertake 
any thing. An analysis of their present constitution would 
show, that they have many ties which would not exist in 
ours ; and that they are by no means a proper model for us. 
</p><p>
Our own experience should satisfy us. We have felt the 
difficulty of drawing out the resources of the country, and 
inducing the states to combine in equal exertions for the 
common cause. The ill success of our last attempt is striking. Some have done a great deal ; others little, or scarcely any thing. The disputes about boundaries, &c. testify 
how flattering a prospect we have of future tranquillity, if 
we do not frame in time a confederacy capable of deciding 
the differences, and compelling the obedience of the respective members. 
</p><p>
The confederation, too, gives the power of the purse too 
entirely to the state legislatures. It should provide perpetual funds in the disposal of congress, by a land tax, poll tax, 
or the like. All imposts upon commerce ought to be laid 
by congress, and appropriated to their use ; for without certain revenues, a government can have no power ; that power which holds the purse strings absolutely, must rule. This 
seems to be a medium, which, without making congress altogether independent, will tend to give reality to its authority. 
</p><p>
Another defect in our system is, want of method and 
energy in the administration. This has partly resulted from 
the other defect ; but in a great degree from prejudice and 
the want of a proper executive. Congress have kept the 
power too much in their own hands, and have meddled 
too much with details of every sort. Congress is properly 
a deliberative corps, and it forgets itself when it attempts 
to play the executive. It is impossible that a body, numerous as it is, constantly fluctuating, can ever act with sufficient decision, or with system. Two thirds of the members, 
one half the time, cannot know what has gone before them, 
or what connexion the subject in hand has to what has been 
transacted on former occasions. The members who have 
been more permanent, will only give information that promotes the side they espouse, in the present case, and will as 
often mislead as enlighten. The variety of business must 
distract, and the proneness of every assembly to debate, 
must at all times delay. 
</p><p>
Lately, congress, convinced of these inconveniences, have 
gone into the measure of appointing boards. But this is, in 
my opinion, a bad plan. A single man, in each department 
of the administration, would be greatly preferable. It would 
give us a chance of more knowledge, more activity, more 
responsibility, and, of course, more zeal and attention. 
Boards partake of a part of the inconveniences of larger assemblies ; their decisions are slower, their energy less, 
their responsibility more diffused. They will not have the 
same abilities and knowledge as an administration by single 
men. Men of the first pretensions will not so readily engage in them, because they will be less conspicuous, of less 
importance, have less opportunity of distinguishing themselves. The members of boards will take less pains to inform themselves and arrive at eminence, because they have 
fewer motives to do it. All these reasons conspire to give 
a preference to the plan of vesting the great executive departments of the state in the hands of individuals. As these men will be, of course, at all times under the direction of 
congress, we shall blend the advantages of a monarchy and 
republic in one constitution. 
</p><p>
A question has been made, whether single men could be 
found to undertake these offices. I think they could ; because there would be then every thing to excite the ambition of candidates. But in order to this, congress, by their 
manner of appointing them, and the line of duty marked 
out, must show that they are in earnest in making these offices, offices of real trust and importance. 
</p><p>
I fear a little vanity has stood in the way of these arrangements, as thotfgh they would lessen the importance of congress, and leave them nothing to do. But they would have 
precisely the same rights and powers as heretofore, happily disencumbered of the detail. They would have to inspect the conduct of their ministers, deliberate upon their 
plans, originate others for the public good, only observing this rule, that they ought to consult their ministers, and 
get all the information and advice they could from them, before they entered into any new measures, or made changes 
in the old. 
</p><p>
A third defect is, the fluctuating constitution of our army. 
This has been a pregnant source of evil ; all our military 
misfortunes, three-fourths of our civil embarrassments, are 
to be ascribed to it. The General has so fully enumerated 
the mischiefs, in a late letter to congress, that I could only 
repeat what he has said, and will, therefore, refer you to 
that letter. 
</p><p>
The imperfect and unequal provision made for the army, 
is a fourth defect, \vhich you will find delineated in the same 
letter. Without a speedy change, the army must dissolve ; 
it is now a mob rather than an army, without clothing, without pay, without provision, without morals, without discipline. We begin to hate the country for its neglect of us ; the country begins to hate us for our oppressions 
of them. Congress have long been jealous of us ; we have 
now lost all confidence in them, and give the worst construction to all they do. Held together by the slenderest 
ties, we are ripening for a dissolution. 
</p><p>
The present mode of supplying the army by state purchases 
is not one of the least considerable defects of our system. 
It is too precarious a dependence, because the states will never be sufficiently impressed with our necessities. Each will 
make its own ease a primary object, the supply of the army a secondary one. The variety of channels through 
which the business is transacted, will multiply the number 
of persons employed, and the opportunities of embezzling 
public money. From the popular spirit on which most of 
the governments turn, the state agents will be men of less 
character and ability ; nor will there be so rigid a responsibility among them as there might easily be among those in 
the employ of the continent ; of course not so much diligence, care, or economy. Very little of the money raised 
in the several states will go into the continental treasury, 
on pretence that it is all exhausted in providing the quotas 
of supplies, and the public will be without funds for the 
other demands of government. The expense will be ultimately much greater, and the advantage much smaller. 
We actually feel the insufficiency of this plan, and have 
reason to dread, under it, a ruinous extremity of want. 
</p><p>
These are the principal defects in the present system that 
now occur to me. There are many inferior ones in the 
organization of particular departments, and many errors 
of administration, which might be pointed out ; but the 
task would be troublesome and tedious, and if we had once 
remedied those I have mentioned, the. others would not be 
attended with much difficulty. 
</p><p>
I shall now propose the remedies which appear to me 
applicable to our circumstances, and necessary to extricate our affairs from their present deplorable situation. 
The first step must be to give congress powers competent to the public exigencies. This may happen in two 
ways : one by resuming and exercising the discretionary 
powers I suppose to have been originally vested in them 
for the safety of the states, and resting their conduct on the 
candour of their countrymen and the necessity of the conjuncture ; the other, by calling immediately a convention 
of all the states, with full authority to conclude finally upon 
a general confederation, stating to them beforehand explicitly the evils arising from a want of power in congress, 
and the impossibility of supporting the contest on its present footing, that the delegates may come possessed of 
proper sentiments, as well as proper authority, to give efficacy to the meeting. Their commission should include a 
right of vesting congress with the whole or a proportion of 
the unoccupied lands, to be employed for the purpose of 
raising a revenue, reserving the jurisdiction to the states by 
whom they are granted. 
</p><p>
The first plan, I expect, will be thought too bold an expedient by the generality of congress ; and, indeed, their 
practice hitherto has so rivetted the opinion of their want 
of power, that the success of this experiment may very 
well be doubted. 
</p><p>
I see no objection to the other mode that has any weight 
in competition with the reasons for it. The convention 
should assemble the first of November next ; the sooner 
the better ; our disorders are too violent to admit of a common or lingering remedy. The reasons for which I require them to be vested with plenipotentiary authority arc, 
that the business may suffer no delay in the execution, and 
may in reality come to effect. A convention may agree 
upon a confederation ; the states, individually, hardly ever 
will. We must have one, at all events, and a vigorous 
one, if we mean to succeed in the contest and be happy 
hereafter. As I said before, to engage the states to comply with this mode, congress ought to confess to them, 
plainly and unanimously, the impracticability, of supporting 
our affairs on the present footing, and without a solid coercive union. I ask that the convention should have a 
power of vesting the whole or a part of the unoccupied 
lands in congress, because it is necessary that body should 
have some property, as a fund for the arrangements of 
finance ; and I know of no other kind that can be given 
them. 
</p><p>
The confederation, in my opinion, should give congress a 
complete sovereignty ; except as to that part of internal 
police which relates to the rights of property and life 
among individuals, and to raising money by internal taxes. 
It is necessary that every thing belonging to this should be 
regulated by the state legislatures. Congress should have 
complete sovereignty in all that relates to war, peace, 
trade, finance ; and to the management of foreign affairs ; 
the right of declaring war, of raising armies, officering, 
paying them, directing their motions in every respect ; of 
equipping fleets, and doing the same with them ; of building fortifications, arsenals, magazines, &c. &c. ; of making 
peace on such conditions as they think proper ; of regulating trade, determining with what countries it shall be carried on; granting indulgences; laying prohibitions on all 
the articles of export or import ; imposing duties, granting 
bounties and premiums for raising, exporting, or importing ; 
and applying to their own use the product of these duties, 
only giving credit to the states on whom they are raised 
in the general account of revenues and expense ; instituting admiralty courts, &c. ; of coining money, establishing 
banks on such terms, and with such privileges, as they 
think proper ; appropriating funds, and doing whatever 
else relates to the operations of finance ; transacting 
every thing with foreign nations ; making alliances, offensive and defensive, treaties of commerce, &c. &c. 
The confederation should provide certain perpetual revenues, productive and easy of collection ; a land tax, poll 
tax, or the like, which, together with the duties on trade, 
and the unlocated lands, would give congress a substantial 
existence, and a stable foundation for their schemes of 
finance. What more supplies were necessary, should be 
occasionally demanded of the states, in the present mode of 
quotas. 
</p><p>
The second step I would recommend is, that congress 
should instantly appoint the following great officers of 
state : A Secretary for Foreign Affairs ; a President of 
War ; a President of Marine ; a Financier ; a President of 
Trade ; instead of this last, a Board of Trade may be preferable, as the regulations of trade are slow and guarded, 
and require prudence and experience, (more than other 
qualities,) for which boards are very well adapted. 
</p><p>
Congress should choose for these offices, men of the first 
abilities, property, and character, in the continent ; and 
such as have had the best opportunities of being acquainted 
with the several branches. <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met kin'>General Schuyler</a>, whom you 
mentioned, would make an excellent President of War ; 
General McDougal a very good President of Marine ; Mr. 
Robert Morris would have many things in his favour for 
the department of Finance. He could, by his own personal influence, give great weight to the measures he should 
adopt. I dare say, men equally capable may be found for 
the other departments. 
</p><p>
I know not if it would not be a good plan to let the Financier be President of the Board of Trade ; but he should 
only have a casting voice in determining questions there. 
There is a connexion between trade and finance, which 
ought to make the director of one acquainted with the 
other; but the financier should not direct the affairs of 
trade, because, for the sake of acquiring reputation by increasing the revenues, he might adopt measures that would 
depress trade. In what relates to finance he should be 
alone. 
</p><p>
These officers should have nearly the same powers and 
functions as those in France analogous to them, and each 
should be chief in his department, with subordinate boards, 
composed of assistants, clerks, &c., to execute his orders. 
</p><p>
In my opinion, a plan of this kind would be of inconceivable utility to our affairs ; its benefits would be very speedily felt. It would give new life and energy to the operations of government. Business would be conducted with 
despatch, method, and system. A million of abuses now 
existing would be corrected, and judicious plans would be 
formed and executed for the public good. 
</p><p>
Another step of immediate necessity is, to recruit the 
army for the war, or at least for three years. This must 
be done by a mode similar to that which is practised in 
Sweden. There the inhabitants are thrown into classes of 
sixteen, and when the sovereign wants men, each of these 
classes must furnish one. They raise a fixed sum of money, and if one of the class is willing to become a soldier, 
he receives the money and offers himself a volunteer ; if 
none is found to do this, a draft is made, and he on whom 
the lot falls, receives the money, and is obliged to serve. 
The minds of the people are prepared for a thing of this 
kind ; the heavy bounties they have been obliged to pay 
for men to serve a few months, must have disgusted them 
with this mode, and made them desirous of another, that 
will, once for all, answer the public purposes, and obviate 
a repetition of the demand. It ought by all means to be 
attempted ; and congress should frame a general plan, and 
press the execution upon the states. When the confederation comes to be framed, it ought to provide for this, by 
a fundamental law ; and hereafter there would be no doubt 
of the success. But we cannot now wait for this : we 
want to replace the men whose times of service will expire the first of January ; for then, without this, we shall 
have no army remaining, and the enemy may do what 
they please. The General, in his letter already quoted, 
has assigned the most substantial reasons for paying immediate attention to this point. 
</p><p>
Congress should endeavour, both upon their credit in Europe, and by every possible exertion in this country, to provide clothing for their officers, and should abolish the whole 
system of state supplies. The making good the depreciation of the currency, and all other compensations to the 
army, should be immediately taken up by congress, and 
not left to the states ; if they would have the accounts of 
depreciation liquidated, and governmental certificates given 
for what is due, in specie, or an equivalent to specie, it 
would give satisfaction, appointing periodical settlements 
for future depreciation. 
</p><p>
The placing the officers upon half-pay, during life, would 
be a great stroke of policy, and would give congress a 
stronger tie upon them than any thing else they can do. 
No man, that reflects a moment, but will prefer a permanent provision of this kind, to any temporary compensation ; nor is it opposed to economy ; the difference between 
this, and what has been already done, will be insignificant. 
The benefit of it to the widows, should be confined to those 
whose husbands die during the war. As to the survivors, 
not more than one-half, on the usual calculation of men's 
lives, will exceed the seven years for which the half-pay is 
already established. Besides this, whatever may be the 
visionary speculations of some men at this time, we shall 
find it indispensable, after the war, to keep on foot a considerable body of troops ; and all the officers retained for 
this purpose, must be deducted out of the half-pay list. If 
any one will take the pains to calculate the expense on 
these principles, I am persuaded he will find the addition 
of expense from the establishment proposed, by no means 
a national object. 
</p><p>
The advantages of securing the attachment of the army 
to congress, and binding them to the service, by substantial 
ties, are immense. 
</p><p>
We should, then, have discipline ; an army in reality, as 
well as in name. Congress would then have a solid basis 
of authority and consequence ; for with me it is an axiom, 
that in our constitution an army is essential to the American union. 
</p><p>
The providing of supplies, is the pivot of every thing 
else ; (though a well constituted army would not, in a small 
degree, conduce to this, by giving consistency and weight 
to government,) there are four ways, all which must be 
united, a foreign loan, heavy pecuniary taxes, a 
tax in kind, a bank founded on public and private credit. 
</p><p>
As to a foreign loan, I dare say, congress are doing every 
thing in their power to obtain it. The most effectual way 
will be, to tell France that without it, we must make terms 
with Great Britain. This must be done with plainness and 
firmness,but with respect and without petulance ; not as a menace, but as a candid declaration of our circumstances. We 
need not fear to be deserted by France ; her interest and 
honour are too deeply involved in our fate ; and she can 
make no possible compromise. She can assist us, if she is 
convinced it is absolutely necessary, either by lending us, 
herself, or by becoming our surety, or by influencing Spain. 
It has been to me astonishing, how any man could have 
doubted, at any period of our affairs, of the necessity of a 
foreign loan. It was self-evident that we had not a fund 
of wealth in this country, capable of affording revenues 
equal to the expenses. We must, then, create artificial revenues, or borrow ; the first was done, but it ought to have 
been foreseen, that the expedient could not last, and we 
should have provided in time for its failure. 
Here was an error of congress. I have good reason to 
believe, that measures were not taken in earnest early 
enough to procure a loan abroad : I give you my honour, 
that from our first outset, I thought as I do now ; and wished 
for a foreign loan, not only because I foresaw it would be 
essential, but because I considered it a tie upon the nation 
from which it was derived, and as a mean to prop our cause 
in Europe. 
</p><p>
Concerning the necessity of heavy pecuniary taxes, I 
need say nothing, as it is a point in which every body is 
agreed; nor is there any danger, that the product of any 
taxes raised in this way, will overburthen the people, or exceed the wants of the public. Indeed, if all the paper in 
circulation were drawn annually into the treasury, it would 
neither do one nor the other. 
</p><p>
As to a tax in kind, the necessity of it results from this 
principle, that the money in circulation is not a sufficient 
representative of the productions of the country, and consequently no revenues raised from it, as a medium, can be 
a competent representative of that part of the products 
of the country, which it is bound to contribute to the support 
of the public. The public, therefore, to obtain its due, or 
satisfy its just demands and its wants, must call for a part 
of these products themselves. This is done in all those 
countries which are not commercial ; in Russia, Prussia, 
Denmark, Sweden, &c., and is peculiarly necessary in our 
case. 
</p><p>
Congress, in calling for specific supplies, seem to have 
had this in view ; but their intention has not been answered. The states, in general, have undertaken to furnish the 
supplies by purchase, a mode, as I have observed, attended with every inconvenience, and subverting the principle on which the supplies were demanded, the insufficiency of our circulating medium, as a representative for 
the labour and commodities of the country. It is, therefore, necessary, that congress should be more explicit; 
should form the outlines of a plan for a tax in kind, and recommend it to the states, as a measure of absolute necessity. 
</p><p>
The general idea I have of a plan is, that a respectable 
man should be appointed by the state in each county to 
collect the taxes, and form magazines ; that congress should 
have in each state an officer to superintend the whole, and 
that the state collectors should be subordinate and responsible to them. This continental superintendent might be 
subject to the general direction of the quarter-master-general, or not, as might be deemed best ; but if not subject to 
him, he should be obliged to make monthly returns to the 
President at War, who should instruct him what proportion to deliver to the quarter-master-general. It may be 
necessary, that the superintendents should sometimes have 
power to dispose of the articles in their possession, on public account ; for it would happen, that the contributions, 
in places remote from the army, could not be transported 
to the theatre of operations without too great expense ; in 
which case, it would be eligible to dispose of them, and 
purchase with the money so raised in the counties near the 
immediate scene of war. 
</p><p>
I know the objections which may be raised to this plan, 
its tendency to discourage industry and the like ; but 
necessity calls for it ; we cannot proceed without, and less 
evils must give place to greater. It is, besides, practised 
with success in other countries, and why not in this ? It 
may be said, the examples cited are from nations under 
despotic governments, and that the same would not be 
practicable with us ; but I contend, where the public good 
is evidently the object, more may be effected in governments like ours, than in any other. It has been a constant 
remark, that free countries have ever paid the heaviest 
taxes ; the obedience of a free people to general laws, however hard they bear, is ever more perfect than that of 
slaves to the arbitrary will of a prince. To this, it may be 
added, that Sweden was always a free government, and 
is so now, in a great degree, notwithstanding the late revolution. 
</p><p>
How far it may be practicable to erect a bank on the faint 
credit of the public, and of individuals, can only be certainly 
determined by the experiment ; but it is of so much importance that the experiment ought to be fully tried. When I 
saw the subscriptions going on to the bank established for 
supplying the army, I was in hopes it was only the embryo 
of a more permanent and extensive establishment. But I 
have reason to believe I shall be disappointed. It does not 
seem to be at all conducted on the true principles of a bank. 
The directors of it are purchasing with their stock, instead 
of bank notes as I expected ; in consequence of which, it 
must turn out to be a mere subscription of a particular sum 
of money, for a particular purpose. 
</p><p>
Paper credit never was long supported in any country, 
on a national scale, where it was not founded on the joint 
basis of public and private credit. An attempt to establish 
it on public credit alone, in France, under the auspices of 
Mr. Law, nearly ruined the kingdom. We have seen the 
effects of it in America ; and every successive experiment 
proves the futility of the attempt. Our new money is depreciating almost as fast as the old, though it has, in some 
states, as real funds as paper money ever had. The reason is, that the moneyed men have not an immediate interest 
to uphold its credit. They may even, in many ways, find 
it their interest to undermine it. The only certain manner 
to obtain a permanent paper credit, is to engage the moneyed 
interest immediately in it, by making them contribute the 
whole or part of the stock, and giving them the whole or 
part of the profits. 
</p><p>
The invention of banks, on the modern principle, originated in Venice. There, the public, and a company of moneyed men, are mutually concerned. The Eank of England 
unites public authority and faith, with private credit ; and 
hence we see what a vast fabric of paper credit is raised on 
a visionary basis. Had it not been for this, England would 
never have found sufficient funds to carry on her wars ; but 
with the help of this, she has done, and is doing, wonders. 
The Bank of Amsterdam is on a similar foundation. 
</p><p>
And why cannot we have an American bank ? Are our 
moneyed men less enlightened to their own interest, or less 
enterprising in the pursuit ? I believe the fault is in government, which does not exert itself to engage them in 
such a scheme. It is true, the individuals in America are 
not very rich ; but this would not prevent their instituting 
a bank; it would only prevent its being done with such 
ample funds as in other countries. Have they not sufficient 
confidence in the government, and in the issue of the cause ? 
Let the government endeavour to inspire that confidence, 
by adopting the measures I have recommended, or others 
equivalent to them. Let it exert itself to procure a solid 
confederation, to establish a good plan of executive administration, to form a permanent military force, to obtain, at all events, a foreign loan. If these things were in 
a train of vigorous execution, it would give a new spring 
to our affairs ; government would recover its respectability, 
and individuals would renounce their diffidence. 
</p><p>
The object I should propose to myself, in the first instance, from a bank, would be an auxiliary mode of supplies ; for which purpose contracts should be made between 
government and the bank, on terms liberal and advantageous to the latter. Every thing should be done, in the first 
instance, to encourage the bank ; after it gets well established, it will take care of itself, and government may make the 
best terms it can for itself. 
</p><p>
The first step to establishing the bank, will be to engage 
a number of moneyed men of influence to relish the project, 
and make it a business. The subscribers to that lately established, are the fittest persons that can be found ; and their 
plan may be interwoven. 
</p><p>
The outlines of my plan would be to open subscriptions, 
in all the states, for the stock, which we will suppose to be 
one million of pounds. Real property, of every kind, as 
well as specie, should be deemed good stock ; but at least 
a fourth part of the subscription should be in specie or 
plate. There should be one great company, in three divisions ; in Virginia, <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ; or two, 
at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. The bank should have a right 
to issue bank notes, bearing two per cent, interest for the 
whole of their stock ; but not to exceed it. These notes 
may be payable every three months, or oftener ; and the 
faith of government must be pledged for the support of the 
bank. It must, therefore, have a right, from time to time, 
to inspect its operations ; and must appoint inspectors for 
the purpose. 
</p><p>
The advantages of the bank may consist in this : in the 
profits of the contracts made with government, which should 
bear interest, to be annually paid in specie ; in the loan of 
money at interest, say six per cent. ; in purchasing lives by 
annuities, as practised in England, &c. The benefit resulting to the company is evident, from the consideration, that 
they may employ in circulation a great deal more money 
than they have specie in stock, on the credit of the real 
property which they will have in other use. This money 
will be employed, either in fulfilling their contracts with 
the public, by which, also, they will gain a profit, or in 
loans, at an advantageous interest, or in annuities. 
</p><p>
The bank may be allowed to purchase plate and bullion, 
and coin money, allowing government a part of the profit. 
</p><p>
I make the bank notes bear interest, to obtain a readier 
currency, and to induce the holders to prefer them to specie, to prevent too great a run upon the bank, at any time, 
beyond its ability to pay. 
</p><p>
If government can obtain a foreign loan, it should lend to 
the bank, on easy terms, to extend its influence, and facilitate a compliance with its engagements. If government 
could engage the states to raise a sum of money in specie, 
to be deposited in bank, in the same manner, it would be 
of the greatest consequence. If government could prevail 
on the enthusiasm of the people, to make a contribution in 
plate, for the same purpose, it would be a master stroke. 
Things of this kind sometimes succeed in popular contests; 
and if undertaken with address, I should not despair of its 
success ; but I should not be sanguine. 
</p><p>
The bank may be instituted for a term of years, by way 
of trial ; and the particular privilege of coining money be 
for a term still shorter. 
</p><p>
A temporary transfer of it to a particular company can 
have no inconvenience, as the government are in no condition to improve this resource ; nor could it, in our circumstances, be an object to it, though with the industry of a 
knot of individuals, it might be a valuable one to them. 
</p><p>
A bank of this kind, even in its commencement, would 
answer the most valuable purposes to government, and to 
the proprietors ; in its progress, the advantages will exceed 
calculation. It will promote commerce, by furnishing a 
more extensive medium, which we greatly want, in our circumstances. I mean a more extensive, valuable medium. 
We have an enormous nominal one at this time ; but it is 
only a name. 
</p><p>
In the present unsettled state of things, in this country, 
we can hardly draw inferences, from what has happened in 
others ; otherwise I should be certain of the success of this 
scheme ; but I think it has enough in its favour to be worthy of trial. 
</p><p>
I have only skimmed the surface of the different subjects 
I have introduced. Should the plans recommended come 
into contemplation in earnest, and you desire my farther 
thoughts, I will endeavour to give them more form and 
particularity. 
</p><p>
I am persuaded a solid confederation, a permanent army, a reasonable prospect of subsisting it, would give us 
treble consideration in Europe, and produce a peace this 
winter. 
</p><p>
If a convention is called, the minds of all the states and 
the people ought to be prepared to receive its determinations by sensible and popular writings, which should conform 
to the views of congress. There are epochs in human affairs, when novelty even is useful. If a general opinion 
prevails that the old way is bad, whether true or false, and 
this obstructs or relaxes the operations of the public service, a change is necessary if it be but for the sake of 
change. This is exactly the case now. 'Tis an universal 
sentiment that our present system is a bad one, and that 
things do not go right on this account. The measure of a 
convention would revive the hopes of the people, and give 
a new direction to their passions, which may be improved 
in carrying points of substantial utility. The eastern states 
have already pointed out this mode to congress : they ought 
to take the hint, and anticipate the others. 
</p><p>
And in future, my dear sir, two things let me recommend, 
as fundamental rules for the conduct of congress : to attach 
the army to them by every motive, to maintain an authority, (not domineering,) in all their measures with the 
states. The manner in which a thing is done, has more influence than is commonly imagined. Men are governed 
by opinion : this opinion is as much influenced by appearances as by realities. If a government appears to be confident of its own powers, it is the surest way to inspire the 
same confidence in others. If it is diffident, it may be certain there will be a still greater diffidence in others, and 
that its authority will not only be distrusted, controverted, 
but contemned. 
</p><p>
I wish, too, congress would always consider, that a kindness consists as much in the manner as in the thing. The best 
things, done hesitatingly, and with an ill grace, lose their 
effect, and produce disgust rather than satisfaction or gratitude. In what congress have at any time done for the army, 
they have commonly been too late. They have seemed to 
yield to importunity, rather than to sentiments of justice, or 
to a regard to the accommodation of their troops. An attention to this idea is of more importance than it may be 
thought. I, who have seen all the workings and progress 
of the present discontents, am convinced that a want of 
this has not been among the most inconsiderable causes. 
</p><p>
You will perceive, my dear sir, this letter is hastily written, and with a confidential freedom, not as to a member 
of congress, whose feelings may be sore at the prevailing 
clamour ; but as to a friend, who is in a situation to remedy 
public disorders, who wishes for nothing so much as truth, 
and who is desirous for information, even from those less 
capable of judging than himself. I have not even time to 
correct and copy, and only enough to add, that I am, very 
truly and affectionately, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
