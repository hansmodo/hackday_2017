Your Letter, my dear Caroline, gave me pleasure. 
As all your's are calculated to enliven the spirits, I 
take them as a cordial, which during the residence of 
the baldpated winter and a close confinement to my 
chamber for several weeks, I have been much in 
want of. And now what return can I make you 
What can you expect from age, debility and weakness ? 
</p><p>
Why, you shall have the return of a grateful 
heart, which amidst infirmities is not insensible to the 
many blessings which encompass it. Food, raiment 
and fuel, clear and kind friends and relatives, mental 
food and entertainment sufficient to satisfy the most 
craving appetite and the hopes and prospect of another 
and better country even an heavenly. 
</p><p>
" Eternal power ! from whom these blessings flow, 
Teach me still more to wonder more to know, 
Here round my home still lift my soul to thee, 
</p><p>
And let me ever midst thy bounties raise 
An humble note of thankfulness and praise." 
</p><p>
Although my memory is not so tenacious as in 
youth, nor my eye-sight so clear, my hearing is unimpaired, my heart warm and my affections are as 
fervent to those in whom " my days renew '* as 
formerly to those from " whom my days I drew." I 
have some troubles in the loss of friends by death, 
and no small solicitude for the motherless offspring, 
but my trust and confidence are in that being who 
" hears the young ravens when they cry." I do not 
know my dear Caroline, that I ever gave you 
encouragement to expect me at the valley, although I 
should rejoice to be able to visit you but I now 
look forward with the hope of seeing you here as an 
attendant upon your mother as soon as the spring 
opens and the roads will permit. 
</p><p>
We have snow by the cargo this winter. Not a 
bird flits but a hungry crow now and then, in quest of 
prey. The fruit trees exhibit a mournful picture, 
broken down by the weight of the snow ; whilst the 
running of sleighs and the jingle of bells assure us 
that all nature does not slumber. 
</p><p>
As if you love me, proverbially, you must love my 
dog, you will be glad to learn that Juno yet lives, 
although like her mistress she is gray with age. 
She appears to enjoy life and to be grateful for the 
attention paid her. She wags her tail and announces 
a visiter whenever one appears. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear child remember me with affection to your brother and with kind affection to your 
honored father and also to your uncle whose benevolent qualities I respect and whose cheerful spirits 
have made " the wilderness to smile and blossom as 
the rose." 
</p><p>
Most affectionately, 
</p><p>
Your Grandmother.

Abigail Adams.
