DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I came to this Place on Saturday night, right well, and untir'd with a 70 miles' Journey that day. I met with your 
and my Dolly's joint Letter, which would have refreshed me 
with its kindness, if I had been ever so weary. 
</p><p>
The Account you give of a certain Lady's having entertain'd a new Gallant, in my Absence, did not surprize me; 
for I have been us'd to Rivals, and scarce ever had a Friend 
or a Mistress in my whole Life, that other People did not 
like as well as myself. And, therefore, I did not wonder, 
when I read in the Newspapers some Weeks since, that "the 
Duke of C." (that general Lover) "had made many Visits of late to an old Lady not many Miles from Craven Street." 
I only wonder'd, considering the Dislike she us'd to have 
for the Family, that she would receive his Visits. But as I 
saw, soon after, that Prince Charles had left Rome, and was 
gone a long Journey, nobody knew whither, I made no doubt 
but the Newswriters had mistaken the Person, and that it 
was he, who had taken the Opportunity of my Absence to 
solace himself with his old Friend. 
</p><p>
I thank you for your Intelligence about my Godson. I 
believe you are sincere, when you say you think him as fine 
a Child as you wish to see. He had cut two Teeth, and three, 
in another Letter, make five; for I know you never write 
Tautologies. If I have over-reckon'd, the Number will be 
right by this Time. His being like me in so many Particulars 
pleases me prodigiously ; and I am persuaded there is another, 
which you have omitted, tho' it must have occurred to you 
while you were putting them down. Pray let him have every 
thing he likes; I think it of great Consequence while the 
Features of the Countenance are forming; it gives them a 
pleasant Air, and, that being once become natural and fix'd 
by Habit, the Face is ever after the handsomer for it, and on 
that much of a Person's good Fortune and Success in Life 
may depend. Had I been cross'd as much in my Infant 
Likings and Inclinations as you know I have been of late 
Years, I should have been, I was going to say, not near so 
handsome ; but as the Vanity of that Expression would offend 
other Folk's Vanity, I change it, out of regard to them, and 
say, a great deal more homely. 
</p><p>
I rejoice that your good Mother's new Regimen succeeds 
so well with her. We are to set out, my Son and I, to-morrow 
for London, where I hope to be by the End of the Week, 
and to find her, and you, and all yours well and happy. 
My Love to them all. They tell me Dinner is coming in, 
and I have yet said nothing to Dolly ; but must nevertheless 
conclude, my dear Friend, yours ever most affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

P. S. I am very happy here in the pleasant Family of 
Mr. Bache's Mother and Sister. Dear Dolly, I love you 
more than you can imagine, Yours most sincerely, 
</p><p>
