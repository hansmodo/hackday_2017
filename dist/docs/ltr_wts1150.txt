Dear Brother: I have noticed in the Conscript Act 
the clauses which empowered the President to consolidate the ten companies of a regiment into five, when the 
aggregate was below one-half the maximum standard, 
and to reduce the officers accordingly. Had I dreamed 
that this was going to be made universal, I should have 
written you and begged you for the love of our ruined 
country to implore Lincoln to spare us this last and 
fatal blow. Two years of costly war have enabled the 
North to realize the fact that by organized and disciplined armies alone can she hope to restore the old 
and found a new empire. We had succeeded in making 
the skeletons of armies, eliminating out of the crude 
materials that first came forth the worthless material, 
and had just begun to have some good young colonels, 
captains, sergeants and corporals. -And Congress had 
passed the Conscript Bill, which would have enabled 
the President to fill up these skeleton regiments full 
of privates who soon, .from their fellows, and with 
experienced officers, would make an army capable of 
marching and being handled and directed. But to my 
amazement comes this order. . . . This is a far worse 
defeat than Manassas. Mr. Wade, in his report to 
condemn <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gbm" rel="colleague met">McClellan</a>, gave a positive assurance to the 
army that henceforth, instead of fighting with diminishing ranks, we should feel assured that the gaps made 
by the bullet, by disease, desertion, &c., would be 
promptly filled, whereas only such parts of the Conscript Law as tend to weaken us are enforced, viz. : 5 percent for furlough and 50 per cent of officers and non-commissioned officers discharged to consolidate regiments. 
Even Blair is amazed at this. He protests the order 
cannot be executed, and we should appeal to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="colleague met">Mr. Lincoln</a>, 
whom he still insists has no desire to destroy the army. 
But the order is positive and I don't see how we can 
hesitate. Grant started to-day down to Carthage, and 
I have written to him, which may stave it off for a few 
days, but I tremble at the loss of so many young and 
good officers, who have been hard at work for two years, 
and now that they begin to see how to take care of 
soldiers, must be turned out. . . . 
</p><p>
If not too late, do, for mercy's sake, exhaust your 
influence to stop this consolidation of regiments. Fill 
all the regiments with conscripts, and if the army is 
then too large disband the regiments that prefer to 
serve north of the Potomac and the Ohio. Keep the 
war South at all hazards. If this Consolidation Law 
is literally enforced, and no new draft is made, this 
campaign is over. And the outside world will have a 
perfect right to say our Government is afraid of its own 
people. . . .

Affectionately yours,
