My appreciable friend and esteemed companion,
</p><p>
Though officially you have answered on the point
of the permit of three hundred loads of tobacco that Don
Bernardo Zayago has asked to introduce in order to sell
in the States of Jalisco and Guanajuato as he sees fit,
the use of frankness that our friendship allows
makes me insist on my effort.
</p><p>
I omit in this regard any official correspondence
because I trust you will see to it that this particular interest of
mine will not be disappointed, for I am even willing
to have the permit dated earlier than the passage of the law
that you cite, which is fine since the permit could have been
given before and not used until now.
</p><p>
Under the way in which Tobacco should
be seen, those that were already stored should not be taxed [?]
nor those that until this date
</p>
