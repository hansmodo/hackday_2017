UNITED STATES SENATE CHAMBER,

Dear Brother : It is now wise for you to avoid all expressions of political opinion. Congress and the President are drifting from each other into open warfare. 
Congress is not weak in what it has done, but in what 
it has failed to do. It has adopted no unwise or extreme measures. The Civil Rights Bill and constitutional amendments can be defended as reasonable, 
moderate, and in harmony with Johnson's old position 
and yours. As Congress has thus far failed to provide 
measures to allow legal senators and representatives to 
take their seats, it has failed in a plain duty. This is 
its weakness ; but even in this it will have the sympathy 
of the most of the soldiers, and the people who are not 
too eager to secure rebel political power. As to the 
President, he is becoming Tylerized. He was elected by 
the Union party for his openly expressed radical sentiments, and now he seeks to rend to pieces this party. 
There is a sentiment among the people that this is dishonor. It looks so to me. What Johnson is, is from 
and by the Union party. He now deserts it and betrays 
it. He may varnish it up, but, after all, he must admit 
that he disappoints the reasonable expectations of those 
who entrusted him with power. He may, by a coalition 
with Copperheads and rebels, succeed, but the simple 
fact that nine tenths of them who voted for him do not 
agree with him, and that he only controls the other tenth 
by power entrusted to him by the Union party will 
damn him forever. Besides, he is insincere; he has 
deceived and misled his best friends. I know he led 
many to believe he would agree to the Civil Rights Bill, 
and nearly all who conversed with him until within a 
few days believed he would acquiesce in the amendments, 
and even aid in securing their adoption. I almost fear 
he contemplates civil war. Under these circumstances 
you, Grant, and Thomas ought to be clear of political 
complications. As for myself, I intend to stick to 
finance, but wherever I can will moderate the actions of 
the Union party, and favor conciliation and restoration. 
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
