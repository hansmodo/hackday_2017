</p><p>
Sir,
</p><p>
His Excellency, Count de Vergennes, having been pleased to say that he
would give orders at Calais, for the admission of certain articles which
I wish to bring with me from England, I have thought it best to give a
description of them, before my departure. They will be as follows:
</p><p>
1. A set of table furniture, consisting of China, silver, and plated
ware, distributed into three or four boxes or canteens, for the
convenience of removing them.
</p><p>
2. A box containing small tools for wooden and iron work, for my own
amusement.
</p><p>
3. A box, probably, of books.
</p><p>
4. I expect to bring with me a riding horse, saddle, &c.
</p><p>
The mathematical instruments will probably be so light that I may bring
them in my carriage, in which case, I presume they will pass with my
baggage, under the authority of the passport for my person. If these
orders can be made out in time, I would willingly be the bearer of them
myself.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and
respect, Sir, ,
</p><p>
your most obedient servant,
</p><p>
