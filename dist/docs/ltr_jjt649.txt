My dear sister
</p><p>
I omitted in my last to answer your question as to when I design visiting Beverly. I hope to do so in July; but you must not give yourself any trouble about the vegetables you spoke of; as I am through the blessing of our Heavenly Father enabled now to live on most any thing. Don't get brown bread for me as I have ceased to use it. But when I drop in, I will just eat such things as are convenient.

I heard from Anna on Saturday, she says that she is learning to take things more philosophically. She says that the Dr. Sill finds some inflammation, she is to remain there until the inflammation entirely subsides. She sends love to you. Thomas was very anxious to go with his teacher & a number of the scholars to the Peaks of Otter; but I felt it was too much responsibility for me to take to let him go. Some of the boys might have guns with them & some accident might occur to him & furthermore I didn't know how much it might cost him; as they would be gone several days. Accordingly he remains at home & I hope that he will make considerable progress in Spanish. In consequence of the irritation of my throat, I have not been hearing him much in the last few days. But he is far enough advanced not to study considerably by himself. I hope to have a fine supply of vegetables for you when you come. You must try & bring some other members of the family with you.

Give much love to the children. Thomas is well.
