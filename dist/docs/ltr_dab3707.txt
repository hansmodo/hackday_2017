Dear General, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your letters of the 29th December and 10th of January last. That of the 10th 
came to hand on the 20th instant, and the other on 
the day following. As it is my duty, so it is my 
highest pleasure, to execute every instruction I receive from your Excellency, to the utmost of my 
capacity. Captain Heth having retired to his farm, 
I cannot at this time send his rank, but have inclosed the rank of the Maryland officers ; and will forward that of the other officers by the next conveyance. 
</p><p>
The Indians have lately killed one man upon Ten Mile Creek, and the inhabitants are in great consternation. The frontier settlements will doubtless be 
deserted, as I have not troops to protect them. I 
shall be happy if the proposed expedition, under Colonel Clark, answers your Excellency's expectations. 
Nothing in my power shall be wanting to forward his 
operations. In my last, I begged leave of absence 
until I could do myself the honor to wait upon your 
Excellency. And as my force will now be much reduced, I take the liberty to renew my application. 
With the most perfect respect, &c., 
</p><p>

P. S. I shall be glad to know if it be your Excellency's pleasure to have a garrison continued at 
Fort Mcintosh.
