Dear Hans,<br>
I enjoyed talking with you on the phone. I have heard almost nothing about how you are doing for nearly 20 years, and I would like to change that. Thank you for sending 
Nathaniel a Christmas present. He was so excited on Christmas morning.<br><br>
You say you don't remember Hayden, but I can remember in about <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1974">1974</a>, you seemed to adore him.
There was one summer when I stayed with Gail and Hayden, you and Heidi. I was 19, Heidi was about 2, and I'm not sure of your age. You were
walking and talking quite well. (age 4?).<br><br>
Both your mom and dad were very young, and idealistic, and impulsive when they first met.
One thing I could see, they both loved you and Heidi very much. Keep in touch.<br><br>
love,<br>
Anne Marie
