<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>DEAR GENERAL</a>,--I have received your excellency's favour by <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met friend'>General Greene</a>, and have been much pleased with the arrival of a gentleman who,
not only on account of his merit, and the justness of his views, but
also by his knowledge of the country, and his popularity in this state,
may be very serviceable to the expedition. I willingly part with the
half of my detachment, though I had a great dependence upon them, as
you find it convenient to the good of the service. Any thing, my dear
General, you will order, or even wish, shall always be infinitely
agreeable to me, and I will always feel happy in doing any thing which
may please you, or forward the public good. I am of the same opinion as
your excellency, that dividing our continental troops among the
militia, will have a better effect than if we were to keep them
together in one wing.
</p><p>
You will receive, by <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker'>General Sullivan</a>, an account of his dispositions,
preparations, &c.; I, therefore, have nothing to add, but that I have
been on board of the Admiral the day before yesterday. I saw among
the fleet an ardour and a desire of doing something, which would soon
turn into impatience, if we don't give them a speedy occasion of
fighting. The officers cannot contain their soldiers and sailors, who
are complaining that they have been these four months running after the
British, without getting at them; but I hope they will be soon
satisfied.
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='co-worker met'>Count D'Estaing</a> was very glad of my arrival, as he could open
freely his mind to me. He expressed the greatest anxiety on account of
his wants of every kind, provisions, water, &c.; he hopes the taking of
Rhode Island will enable him to get some of the two above mentioned
articles. The admiral wants me to join the French troops to these I
command, as soon as possible. I confess I feel very happy to think of
my co-operating with them, and, had I contrived in my mind an agreeable
dream, I could not have wished a more pleasing event than my joining my
countrymen with my brothers of America, under my command, and the same
standards. When I left Europe, I was very far from hoping such an
agreeable turn of our business in the American glorious revolution.
</p><p>
Though I have no account, neither observations, to give to your
excellency, as I am here _a man of war of the third rate_, I will,
after the expedition, scribble some lines to you, and join to the
account of <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker'>General Sullivan</a>, the assurance that I have all my limbs,
and that I am, with the most tender affection, and entire confidence,
yours, with high respect.
