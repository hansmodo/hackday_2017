Sir, 
</p><p>
I have had the honor of receiving your Excellency's 
letter of the 11th instant. Give me leave to congratulate you on your safe arrival, and your appointment to 
the command of his Most Christian Majesty's fleet and 
sea forces upon these coasts. It affords me no small 
degree of pleasure to find the command devolve upon 
an officer of your Excellency's distinguished character. 
I have appointed Monday, the 21st of this month, for 
the time of our interview at Weathersfield ; and I shall 
very impatiently wait for the opportunity of convincing 
you personally, that I am, &.c. 
</p>
