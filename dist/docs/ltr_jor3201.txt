</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter of the 20th instant has 
been laid before the Board, informing us that a 
Court-Martial will be held at camp on the 1st of 
May instant, "for the trial of <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a> on the 
first, second, third, and fifth charges exhibited against 
him by this Board." 
</p><p>
We apprehend there must have been some mistake 
in the mode of transmitting this business to your Excellency, as we never exhibited any other charge 
against <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a> to Congress, than that of appropriating the public wagons of the State to private 
uses, and that only that he might remain to answer. 
Nor do we think it by any means consistent with 
the duty we owe the State to be considered in the 
light of parties, as thereby we may establish a principle, under which we may either submit silently to 
injuries and insults, or follow military Courts into 
any part of the country, wherever the service may 
require the army to be. 
</p><p>
The light in which we have ever considered ourselves, and which we would wish to be considered 
by your Excellency, is as a public body, the representatives of the freemen of Pennsylvania, expressing our opinion of <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a>'s conduct, founded 
upon facts disclosed to us, and answering to our own 
knowledge, asking nothing of Congress but that he 
should not continue to command in this State. The 
history of this country affords many instances of this 
proceeding in the cases of oppressive Governors, and 
it is a right which we hold independent, and unaccountable to any other power. No one doubts the 
right of a public body to praise, and this shows very 
strongly they have a power to censure, it only operating as an opinion, unaccompanied with any punishment. 
</p><p>
In the present instance, <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a> refused to 
give any explanation of his conduct, though civilly 
requested, or ever offered to disprove the facts alleged ; of course we were obliged to exercise our judgments upon the evidence and proofs we had. 
At the same time we perfectly approve the trial, being of opinion, that <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a>'s conduct deserves some military reprehension; and we doubt not 
the officers of the army will impartially weigh the 
duty they owe to the country, as well as the person 
charged ; and if the facts are proved, let the palliating circumstances, if there are any, operate on the 
sentence, not on the nature of the transaction. Such 
is the dependence of the army upon the transportation of this State, and such the feelings of the people upon this sort of duty, that, should the Court 
treat it as a light and trivial matter, and found an 
opinion upon any other grounds than the innocence 
of the charge, we fear it will not be practicable to 
draw forth wagons in future, be the emergency what 
it may, and it will have very bad consequences. 
</p><p>
We could have wished your Excellency had appointed a later day, or we could have had earlier 
notice. Your letter is dated the 20th instant, and 
was not received till the 22d; and, considering the 
distance of some of the witnesses, we fear it will not 
be possible to give them notice, much less to procure 
their attendance, and we presume no ex paric testimony ought to be received by the Court, Our view 
of the matter was, and it was so considered by the 
Joint Committees, that we should transmit the papers 
to your Excellency, and inform you of the names of 
the witnesses to prove the several points ; that then 
your Excellency, by your own authority, or that of 
Congress, would have procured the attendance of the 
witnesses. Two officers of Congress, not in any respect under our control, are material witnesses, of 
which we informed Congress, requesting they might 
not proceed to Carolina till their testimony could be 
had. No notice was taken of it, and they set off 
about a week ago, and, as we have reason to think, 
with a view to be absent till the trial is over. 
Colonel Fitzgerald, who is also a material witness, 
we suppose is in Virginia. 
</p><p>
As substantial justice, not a mere formality, is undoubtedly your Excellency's object on this occasion, 
we submit to your judgment whether a competent 
time for the attendance of those witnesses, at least, 
who are within reach, and the adjustment of some 
previous points, will not make a further delay necessary. These points are, at whose expense and by 
whose procurement are the witnesses to be had ; and 
whether the service will not admit of the sitting of 
the Court at some nearer point than camp. If that 
cannot be, we must rely upon your Excellency to 
give further directions for the accommodation of the 
persons who may attend in behalf of the prosecution. 
As the idea expressed in your Excellency's letter 
does not correspond with the resolve of Congress 
transmitted to us, and differs from that entertained 
by the Joint Committee of Congress, Council, and Assembly, in which it was expressly declared that this 
Board was not to be considered as a party, we trust 
the proceedings in this business will conform to this 
idea ; otherwise, besides the inconvenience above mentioned, we shall be liable to a charge of inconsistency 
not well founded. We are, Sir, with every sentiment 
of respect and regard, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servants, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jor" rel="me">JOSEPH REED</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. By the time this will reach your Excellency, there will remain but three days, so that we shall 
be glad to have as early an answer as possible ; for 
we beg leave to assure you, that no other delay is 
sought but what is necessary to proceed to business 
with effect.
