Two or three days ago I rode with Uncle Edmund 
and a small party to the Bishop s palace of which I 
have spoken to you in a former letter. It was a glorious evening, as all are here, about an hour before 
sunset as we galloped our horses out of the western 
extremity of the city, our gay chat frequently interrupted by one or another pointing to the spot where 
some gallant spirit took its flight in the battle. After 
passing the suburbs we immediately struck the base 
of the hill upon which the ruined palace stands and 
ascended it by a winding road scarped from the rock 
and quite practicable for carriages. A near approach 
to this venerable work enabled us to see the elaborate 
carvings of its broad front which is entirely covered 
with them. Immediately over the main entrance is 
a deeply sculptured coat of arms, I am not deep 
enough in heraldic lore to blazon it, above it a stone 
statue of our Saviour standing in a niche supporting 
the Cross, with a carved radiation or glory around His 
head. The walls are many feet in height crowned 
with battlements and lofty turrets. In the centre of 
this spacious building is a square court containing a 
huge deep well some twelve feet in diameter. It is 
now dry but was once filled to within thirty feet of 
the surface. The grounds about the palace were 
irrigated from this well formerly, the hill on each side 
having been terraced and carefully cultivated from 
the summit to the plain below. Not a vestige of these 
gardens is perceptible now, the rains during the lapse 
of many years having washed away the earth, exposing 
the bare rock. . . . The ruined state of this massive 
construction, it having been long unfit for human 
habitation, proves its great antiquity. It must have 
been already crumbling to decay when it was first 
occupied as a military work in 1782. From the back 
of the palace the ridge of the hill continues to rise for 
some two hundred yards, where it suddenly breaks 
off in a steep rocky declivity to the valley between it 
and the Mitre Mountain. Here previous to the cap 
ture was a Mexican sand bag battery, now removed, 
and in its place are the graves of two of the heroes 
who fell in taking it on the twenty-second ultimo, 
Captain Gillespie and another Texan volunteer. From 
this point nearly six hundred feet above the plain I 
gazed at the varied and magnificent view in silent 
admiration. I wish I could describe it in any language 
which would convey even a faint idea of the thrilling 
effect it had upon me.

It was just at the close of day, the sun having already disappeared behind the crest of the mountains 
crowned with fleecy clouds high above our heads. 
The glorious light was still streaming through the 
craggy ravine where winds the broad road to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a>. 
The San Juan here a mountain torrent was visible by 
its side for a long distance, its clear waters foaming 
and sparkling in the horizontal rays like dancing 
diamonds. Below as to the east lay the city, every 
street and plaza in full view, its white walls and battle 
ments glancing through the green foliage in which the 
whole town is embowered, and beyond for a back 
ground to this lovely picture was the mighty Saddle 
Mountain. Immediately below our feet was the rich 
valley of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> stretching far away to the north 
chequered with waving fields of corn and cane, dotted 
with hamlets, cut by numerous rivulets and irrigating 
canals, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> s encampment appearing under 
the lofty trees at Walnut Springs with the light artillery on evening drill, their guns rapidly firing, each 
discharge echoing from the mountains with many 
reverberations. My companions who were them 
selves in the engagements pointed me to the places 
where fell the immortal heroes of those three days of 
conflict. There under that sycamore fell the gallant 
Morris, there the chivalric Barbour, by the side of 
that ruined wall, the fearless Watson, near by Lear 
received his last wound, in that ravine, McKavett 
was cut in twain by a twelve-pound shot, and far on 
our right cresting the summit of that craggy hill were 
the ruins of that fort so desperately carried at the 
point of the bayonet by the Fifth, and from whose 
walls our regimental banner was displayed, the first 
American flag which waved over a Mexican work on 
those memorable days. How tame and prolix is my 
description of a scene which I can never forget ! . . . 
Continued, Monday, November 10. Saturday the 
same party whom I accompanied to the Bishop s 
palace proceeded on an exploring excursion into the 
country. We rode over the plain through enclosed 
fields about five miles to a rude Mexican village 
at the base of a mountain. Here we found the 
" Caliente," a famous hot spring of which we were in 
search. A stone house containing a few benches has 
been erected near it for a dressing-room for the bathers. 
From it, by a few stone steps, we enter a basin some 
twenty feet square enclosed by a high wall of masonry 
containing the water as clear as crystal about four 
feet in depth. On plunging into the water I found it 
to my astonishment so hot that I couldn t bear it at 
first without considerable pain. Where it gushes from 
the earth it is almost scalding hot. It must be heated 
by internal fires far away in the bosom of the earth. 
The water is slightly mineral containing some sulphur 
and nitre, and is said to be extremely good for cutaneous diseases.

Yesterday we were notified that the second division under General Worth were to start for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a> on 
Thursday morning, and we are all now in the bustle 
of preparation. We are to be joined by the first 
regiment of Kentucky volunteers under my old 
friend Tim McKee, and the Seventh Infantry are to 
be left here. We shall probably garrison <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a> for 
the winter, though everything is very uncertain. As 
we are not told what is to be done conjectures are 
various. One that we, General Worth s division, are 
to be joined by General Wool s command and after 
the fall of Tampico, which is to be taken by the other 
wing of the army under Generals Taylor and Patter 
son, are to meet them at San Luis Potosi, and together 
secure Santa Anna s other leg ! I would much prefer 
to have gone to Tampico, where I think will be the 
first fighting and where we could hear frequently from 
the United States. There are some advantages, how 
ever, in the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a> station. It is in a high mountainous country where there is no fear of bilious or of 
yellow fever. . . . There is a report, credited by the 
most intelligent Mexicans here, that Santa Anna has 
ordered Tampico to be abandoned and that he will 
attempt no opposition to us, until we are farther in 
the interior when he expects to use us up as the 
Russians did Napoleon all but the frost and snow. 
... I saw <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> last evening. He is going 
with us to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a> and will start the other column 
when he returns. It is late and I must close as I have 
to be stirring at daylight. . . .
