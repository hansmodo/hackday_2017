MY DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
In compliance with your wish, that I would give you the outlines of the several movements I made in the Northern department, in the year <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>, after <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> reassumed the command, to my being wounded on the 8th of October, I offer the 
following short state of the matter. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>'s arrival in camp at the Sprouts, about twelve 
miles above <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, was announced to me in <a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a>, on the 
19th of September, by his letter of that date to General Stark, 
in which he requests our ideas of a plan for the future operations of the campaign. We were fully of opinion, that a body of 
militia should be collected in the Grants, and move in the rear of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>, as this measure would oblige him to make 
heavy detachments to secure the several posts necessary to cover 
his rear, on the doing of which the salvation of his army might 
depend. He would also be obliged to escort his provision-wagons, 
which would serve to weaken his main body, as <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> 
would have little to fear in front. Besides, this movement would 
cover a large and valuable country, filled with provisions, and re 
strain the unfriendly. 
</p><p>
Immediately on <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> receiving this letter, he ordered 
me to attend him at head-quarters. At that interview I explained 
to him fully the reasons on which our opinion was grounded. 
lie acceded to the propriety of the measure, and ordered me 
back to <a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a>, to receive the Massachusetts militia, who had 
been ordered on, and to make the necessary arrangements to act 
in conjunction with him on a general plan. On the 2d of September, the Commissary reported that there was a deficiency of 
flour, which was an alarming circumstance, as our division was 
to consist of militia, who cannot long be held, without proper 
attention is paid to their supplies. I immediately wrote to the 
officers, civil and military, in the county of Berkshire, requesting 
their attention to this matter, and their aid to forward the flour stored in that part of the country. They, and the people at 
large, stimulated by the most laudable motives, soon gave us, 
though the transportation was extremely difficult, the most ample supply. From an apprehension that it might be too long 
delayed, I wrote to that county for a body of their militia, and 
requested that they would come mounted, each bringing his sack of flour. 
</p><p>
On the 7th, having received some supplies, and good assurance 
that a sufficiency would be sent on, M T e moved to Manchester, 
with the troops which were collected, and gave orders for others 
to follow as they arrived. On the 8th, I reached <a href='/results.php?city=pawlet' rel='city'>Pawlet</a> with 
part of the troops. Here we halted for the arrival of the remainder, and the stores, and to know the situation of the enemy, and 
because it was a strong post, both of our flanks being covered by 
mountains, in most places impassable, forming, at this place, al 
most the point of an acute angle, not unlike my ideas of the 
strength of Thermopylae. Thus far we could pass with wagons. 
</p><p>
On the loth, our little army being collected, which consisted of 
two thousand five hundred men, and the stores being arrived, to 
execute our general plan, which was to annoy, divide, and distract the enemy, Colonel Brown was sent with five hundred men 
across the Narrows (part of Lake Champlain, or, as it is some 
times called, South Bay), to the north end of Lake George, with 
instructions to destroy all the boats and stores there belonging to 
the enemy, and, if possible, to relieve our prisoners at that post. 
Colonel Johnson was ordered, with a like number of men, to 
Mount Independence, with instructions to attempt that post, to 
favor the designs of Colonel Brown. Colonel Woodbridge was 
ordered with five hundred men to Skenesborough, with instructions to proceed to Fort Anne, and from thence to attempt the 
enemy's post at the Mills, if it could be done without risking too 
much. Hereby he became a cover to Colonel Brown, and se 
cured his retreat, if nothing more could be effected. In order to 
give despatch to these enterprises, and ease to the troops, the 
horse, which I wrote for from Berkshire to come on with sacks, 
having arrived, they were divided among the three commands, and 
took on the flour. The beeves were kept on foot. A number of 
militia light-horse were ordered on, with their saddle-bags filled 
with spare cartridges. Thus the men moved very light, and with 
great despatch. 
</p><p>
On the 17th, after leaving four hundred men to cover the 
stores at <a href='/results.php?city=pawlet' rel='city'>Pawlet</a>, I moved with six hundred towards Skenesborough, in order to join Colonel "Woodbridge, the more effectually 
to cover Colonel Brown ; at which post I intended Colonels 
Brown and Johnson should join me, in order to move in force 
into the rear of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>. 
</p><p>
Colonel Johnson arrived in time before Mount Independence, 
and remained there a number of days; but, finding the enemy too 
well covered to attempt an assault with a probability of success, 
he returned when ordered. The enemy having evacuated their 
posts in their rear, it became unnecessary for Colonel Woodbridge 
to proceed farther than Skenesborough. Colonel Brown's success 
you have fully represented in the following extracts from his re 
port to me. 
</p><p>
On the 19th, I received a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, approving the measures I had taken, and expressing his wish that I 
would take a different post, as <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> had totally 
neglected his rear. I then ordered the troops, who were on their 
march to Skenesborough, to return to <a href='/results.php?city=pawlet' rel='city'>Pawlet</a>. On the 20th, I 
received his orders to take post at Stillwater. This laid me under the necessity of giving orders to our troops, before <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> and Mount Independence, to return and join me at Stillwater, as soon as they should have succeeded, or all hopes of 
success should be cut off; and, after leaving a proper guard at 
<a href='/results.php?city=pawlet' rel='city'>Pawlet</a>, to march the troops, not on command, to Stillwater. I 
left them, on the 21st, to be marched by their proper officers, 
and reached head-quarters at Behmus's Heights, in the evening 
of the 22d. 
</p><p>
After my arrival in camp, the General gave me the right wing 
of the army, which consisted of Nixon's, Glover's, and Patterson's 
brigades, and the Massachusetts militia, as they arrived from the 
expedition northward. Thus matters remained, without any thing 
very particular, until the 7th of October. In the afternoon, the 
enemy moved with their right towards our left. The light troops 
were sent out to skirmish with them, to retard and observe their 
motions; for the General was apprehensive that they meant a 
feint on the left while they should attempt a real attack on our right. The light troops were reenforced by Poor's and Learned's 
brigade on the left. As the action became serious, they were 
reenforced by militia and detachments from the right. Towards 
evening, <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> ordered me to move with the right, and 
attack the enemy's left; but it became so dark before we could 
reach their line, that nothing happened there but some skirmishing between the advanced parties. Their right suffered greatly, 
and were driven within their lines ; and some of their outworks 
were carried by our people, and the day ended gloriously on our side. 
</p><p>
I received orders to move by daylight, in the morning of the 
8th, with the right, and attempt the enemy's lines. We advanced 
three brigades, each brigade forming a column, and marching 
from its own encampment. At the same time, there was a movement on the left. On the approach of our advanced corps, the 
enemy, after exchanging n few shots, left their lines, to be possessed by us, and took post on a height in the rear of their lines. 
Soon after this I received a wound in my leg, which prevented 
my remaining longer in the field ; and my long ill health prevented my remarking further particulars on the campaign, which 
ended with so much advantage to America, and so justly to the 
honor of <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>. 
</p><p>
I am, my dear Sir, &c.,
