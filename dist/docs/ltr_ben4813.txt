MY LORD, 
</p><p>
I got home in good time, and well. But on perusing the 
Letters that were come to me from America during my Absence, and considering the Business they require of me, I 
found it not convenient to return so soon as I had intended. 
I regret my having been obliged to leave that most agreable 
Retirement which good Mrs. Shipley put me so kindly in 
possession of. I now breathe with Reluctance the Smoke 
of London, when I think of the sweet Air of Twyford. And 
by the Time your Races are over, or about the Middle of next 
Month, (if it should then not be unsuitable to your Engagements or other Purposes) I promise myself the Happiness 
of spending another Week or two where I so pleasantly 
spent the last. 
</p><p>
I have taken the Liberty of sending by the Southampton 
Stage, which goes to-morrow, a Parcel directed to your Lordship, to be left at the Turnpike next beyond Winchester, containing one of my Books for Miss Georgiana, which I hope 
she will be good enough to accept as a small Mark of my 
Regard for her philosophic Genius: and a Specimen of the 
American dry'd Apples for Mrs. Shipley, that she may judge 
whether it will be worth while to try the Practice. I doubt 
some Dust may have got among them, as I found the Cask 
uncovered: therefore it will not perhaps be amiss to rinse 
them a minute or two in warm Water and dry them quick 
in a Napkin : but this is submitted to her better Judgment. 
With the greatest Esteem and Respect, and many Thanks 
for your abundant Civilities, I am, my Lord, &c. 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
