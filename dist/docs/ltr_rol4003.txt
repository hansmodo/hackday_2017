Dear John, 
</p><p>
I received yours of the 23d May from Madrid, with 
duplicates thereof, and the letters you wrote from Cadiz 
and Martinique. 
</p><p>
Your remembrance of the pleasurable days of our 
youth, and the scenes in which we mutually bore our parts, 
together with the attractions which this country still has for 
you, afford me the most pleasing hope that neither time nor 
absence will weaken a friendship which has so long stood 
the test of both. This indeed I expected from the steadiness of your temper ; but I must confess that I had little 
hopes that your early return would afford me a prospect of 
deriving that consolation from it in the decline of life, to 
which I looked even while it directed the pursuits and animated the pleasures of youth. 
</p><p>
You mistake your own heart when you say you are unambitious : and without the assurance contained in your 
letter, I should have believed that the love of glory would 
have always kept you in the line in which you now are, 
more especially as the general satisfaction that your appointment and conduct since has given, renders it the wish of 
everybody less interested in your return than I am, to keep 
you abroad. 
</p><p>
I have not been able to procure at this place the key to 
the cipher that you directed me to, though I believe I have it 
at home ; besides that, it is very intricate and troublesome ; 
I shall therefore be obliged to confine what I have to say 
to mere common occurrences. I enclose you a cipher 
which is very simple, and not to be deciphered while the 
key is concealed, as the same figure represents a variety of 
letters. In order that you may know whether it comes 
safely to hand, I have in this letter used the precaution 
mentioned in yours. 
</p><p>
Nothing astonishes me more than the confidence with 
which the British ministry and their dependants assert, that 
America sighs to return to their government, since the fact 
is that we never were more determined in opposition, nor, 
if we except the derangement of our finances (which the 
loan of half a million would re-establish, if remitted in 
specie or merchandise), were we ever so capable of resistance. Our crops are uncommonly fine, and the militia of 
every State north and east of Delaware, is armed, disciplined, and inured to the duties of a camp. The southern 
militia are now at school, and I have no doubt will improve 
by the lessons they receive from the enemy. Our friend 
Smith, who has probably contributed to this ministerial 
madness, uninstructed by his repeated disappointments from 
the beginning of the war, is said to have advised Kniphausen to erect the royal standard in the Jerseys before 
General Clinton returned from <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, persuaded that 
our troops, and particularly the militia, would flock to it, 
and thus he have the honour of reducing the country, without sharing it with Clinton. He accordingly came over 
with great parade, with his whole force, scattering exaggerated accounts in printed handbills of the loss of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, 
which, instead of discouraging, only animated the militia. 
They were all in motion upon the first alarm, and though 
opposed only by them and less than a thousand continental 
troops, he was disgracefully driven out with the loss of 500 
men killed, wounded, and taken, after having penetrated 
ten miles from the shore, and done us no other injury than 
the burning of a few houses, and the abuse and murder of 
some women ; since which they have been more cautious 
and less sanguine. Adieu ; remember my compliments to 
the colonel and Mr. Carmichael. I am, dear John, 
</p><p>
Most sincerely yours, 
</p><p>
