DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
At three quarters after eleven o clock this fore 
noon, I received a letter from General Thompson, of 
which the inclosed is a copy. I find that he has 
proceeded in the manner proposed, and made his at 
tack on the troops at Three Rivers, at daylight ; for 
at that time a very heavy cannonading began, which 
lasted, with some intervals, to twelve o clock. It is 
now near one, P. M. ; the firing has ceased, except 
some irregular firing with cannon, at a considerable 
distance of time one from the other. At eight o clock, 
a very heavy firing of smallarms was heard, even 
here, at the distance of forty-five miles. The distance 
might have rendered it doubtful, had not the boats 
down the bay, which have since arrived, confirmed it, 
and declared that they distinctly heard the smallarms 
for a long time. I am almost certain that victory 
has declared in our favor, as the irregular firing of 
the cannon for such a length of time after the small-arms ceased, shows that our men are in possession of 
the ground. 
</p><p>
I should immediately set off to join General 
Thompson, with Colonel Dehaas's detachment; but 
by some strange kind of conduct in <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a>, 
directly contrary to repeated orders, lie has kept that 
detachment dancing between this and Montreal ever 
since my arrival. Some of the officers, this moment 
arrived, inform me that he let them come within 
eighteen miles of this place, and ordered them back 
again. He has now permitted them to pass to <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, and I expect them here this evening, when I shall immediately set off with them to join General Thompson. I am now informed, by Mr. McCarty, that <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a> has abandoned Montreal, and gone to <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, with all the troops. I hope this report is 
not just, as the step must, in every light, be imprudent and injudicious ; it leaves that quarter entirely 
without a check, and gives our enemies liberty to assemble and form any mischievous designs they please, without interruption. 
</p><p>
I hear that the report at Montreal, yesterday, was, 
that the enemy had passed us at <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a>, and were 
passing up the river. This gave them the alarm, 
and caused them to abandon the city. I wish it 
may not prove true ; but, as it is so much of a piece 
with former conduct, I cannot help giving it some degree of credit. Notwithstanding the weakness of this 
post, occasioned by the strange delay of Colonel De-haas, I have sent Colonel Winds, with his regiment, 
to reenforce General Thompson. This I did this 
morning, at eight o clock. They have joined him be 
fore now, I trust. I hope soon to follow, with more 
force, to maintain the ground which, I dare say, our 
troops have won. We hear no firing now, except a 
few cannon at a great distance of time between, 
sometimes half an hour's space at least. This, with 
many other circumstances, induces me to believe our 
troops are victorious. I am anxious to know the 
event, which God grant may be fortunate. However, 
if our party have been, or should be, defeated, I am 
determined not to leave Canada, but to make vigi 
lance and industry supply the want of numbers. I 
am determined to fortify and secure the most important posts, and hold them as long as one stone is 
left upon another. 
</p><p>
It is a serious truth that our army is extremely weak. Colonel Greaton is with me, without a single man, all under inoculation- Colonel Bond, with all 
his regiment ; in the same situation ; Colonel Patter 
son has six only; Colonel Stark, about forty; Colonel 
Reed's and Colonel Poor's nearly in the same situation. Poor is at St. John's ; Reed at Chaniblee. <a href='/results.php?tla=aab' rel='colleague'>Colonel Burr</a>ell's return I sent in my last, and the other 
regiments are most of them in the same situation; 
for this Colony, it seems, has of late been considered 
the general hospital of America. The party with 
General Thompson, and that with Colonel Dehaas, 
contain the flower of our army at present. Some 
regiments are nearly out of the smallpox, and will 
be fit for duty in a few days. Our numbers will be 
daily increasing. I should rejoice, however, to see 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> here, with his brigade, if he can be 
spared from JS T ew York. 
</p><p>
June 12, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. I could not close the foregoing 
letter, till I could get some certain intelligence of 
General Thompson and his party, most of which, 
after being unfortunately repulsed, are now returned ; 
but the General himself, with Colonel Irvine, Dr. McKenzie, Mr. Currie, Mr. Bird, Mr. Edy, and Parson Colley, are unluckily fallen into the hands of our 
enemies. A flag has arrived this night for their bag 
gage, by which he writes that he and the other Gentlemen are treated with the greatest politeness by 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>, who commands at Three Rivers. 
The officers suppose they had about twenty-five killed, and we find missing in the whole about a hundred and fifty, some of which we expect in yet, as 
some have arrived this evening, and say more will 
be in. The General was taken, after the retreat, by 
some Canadian militia, summoned in by Caiieton. I 
have also a number, which I have summoned in to 
take part with us, under the Baron de Woedtke. 
Our people say that the Canadians were, in general, 
very kind to them, upon their retreat, and gave them 
every assistance in their power. 
</p><p>
The unfortunate defeat of General Thompson and 
his detachment happened in this manner; namely, 
the repeated accounts from Three Rivers of the smallness of their numbers induced General Thompson to 
detach <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>Colonel St. Clair</a> to attack them with seven 
hundred men, "before my arrival. This not being put 
in execution, and St. Clair remaining at Nicolet, and 
the account of their weakness being confirmed, the 
General solicited the liberty of attacking them, which 
I granted, giving the orders which I inclosed in my 
last. He crossed from Nicolet to Three Rivers in 
the night, but being led into a morass by his guides, 
was obliged to return back near two miles; in which 
time the day broke, he was discovered, the ships be 
gan to cannonade, and continued while he marched 
through a swamp, which took near an hour and a 
half. The people came up to the attack, but, unluckily for them, twenty-five vessels had arrived that 
evening with troops, which they landed, while he 
marched on, and, being well prepared, gave them so 
warm a reception that the troops soon broke and 
quitted the ground. The cannonading and all the 
firing after that was a mere random firing, which answered very little purpose. When they found our 
troops began to give way, they detached a party of 
six hundred by the side of the river, to attack them 
in flank, and secure our bateaux. The bateaux were 
preserved by Major Woods, who brought them off. 
One bateau only was taken, with four barrels of powder, and nothing else on board; the men escaped. 
</p><p>
This, dear General, is a state of this unfortunate 
enterprise. What you will hear next, I cannot say. 
I am every moment informed of the vast number of 
the enemy which have arrived. Some, indeed, say 
that great numbers have arrived from England, and 
all the troops from Halifax. This I do not believe ; 
but I apprehend their numbers now are very great. 
I have here only two thousand five hundred and thirty-three, rank and file. Most of the officers seem 
discouraged, and, of course, their men. I am employed, day and night, in fortifying and securing my camp, 
and am. determined to hold it as long as a person 
will stick by me. I have heard nothing of Colonel 
Dayton s, or the residue of Colonel Wayne's regiment, 
or of the others ordered here. Sure I am that they 
are much wanted. There are some regiments all down 
with the smallpox; not a single man fit for duty. 
This will be remedied in time, unless the enemy make 
a sudden push, which, indeed, we expect every hour. 
If so, we must, with the numbers we have, sustain 
their efforts, and I hope repulse them.

Dear General, I am, with much regard, your most devoted, humble servant,

P. S. Our old friend Colonel Louis, of the Caghnawagas, has this moment arrived express from that tribe. He says all the Indians have made peace, 
even the Canasadagas, and those tribes which joined Captain Forster at the Cedars, except the Roundorks. These have refused in council, and say they will take 
arms for the King, and have sent to General Carleton to let him know it. This tribe consists of fifty warriors only. The Caghnawagas and other tribes desire we should send up some other tribes, which they will join with, to extirpate them. This they would do themselves, but are apprehensive that some few French, through the influence of their priests, will join them. Indeed I can but illy spare the force; but it is a matter of too much importance to be neglected. I must, therefore, send some force under the command of an experienced officer. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, your Excellency's most obedient servant,
