My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your esteemed letter of the 15th  ins t accompanied by a copy of one 
from the Honb 1 Washington Hunt member of congress from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">N. York</a>, 
have this moment reached me, for which you have my best thanks 
</p><p>
While no one can possibly hold in higher estimation than I do the 
talents & character both public & private of Mr Hunt, as well as many 
other Whigs in & out of Congress, particularly the honb Truman Smith, 
& however I may dislike to differ with them as regards defining my position 
as a candidate for the presidency, which 1 shall regret to do, I must again 
say I have no wish to occupy that high station ; nor am I a candidate 
farther than the people have or may think proper to make me so ; nor 
can I change the position I have taken, which is, not to be the exclusive 
candidate of any party ; for if I occupy the White House, I must be 
untrammelled & unpledged, so as to be the president of the nation, & 
not of a party ; making the interest of the whole country my only object, 
within the prescribed limits of the constitution; not as I might see fit to 
construe that instrument, but as it was done & acted on by our first presidents ; whose opinions in regard to the same I would adopt, & carry out 
as far as it was possible to do so ; following in their footsteps, as we know 
they were wise, prudent & patriotic 
</p><p>
If those who are not willing to trust me after what I have stated, as 
to what would be my course if elected, which have been published over & 
over again in so many of the newspapers of the day, they must look out 
for one who will give such pledges as they may require & if elected I will 
not complain 
</p><p>
I believe the course the Whigs are pursuing in regard to the election 
in question, will have the effect of fixing on the country the present party 
in power, until there is nothing left of the constitution but the name. A 
Whig national convention to select candidates to fill the two highest offices 
known to our laws, will result in no good, but will aid if it is not the 
cause of bringing about a strict party vote between them, & their opponents ; & as they are in the minority, when we take into consideration the 
immense influx of foreigners into our country, who are carried to the polls 
& are permitted to vote immediately on their arrival, naturalized or not, 
nineteen out of twenty if not more, vote the democratic ticket, the result 
cannot be doubtful ; besides we ought to know whenever the community 
becomes excited on such matters, the love of party with many without 
there being aware of it, is stronger than the love of country; whereas had 
the Whigs gone on quietly & nominated their candidates by primary 
assemblies & state legislatures, without imposing restrictions on them, & 
invited all to join them irrespective of party, who were for saving or sustaining the constitution in its purity, they must have succeed in overturn 
ing the present dynasty; & I hope the downward tenden of our national 
affairs would at any rate for a time at least, have been arrested 
</p><p>
Should I be nominated by a Whig or Democratic convention, State 
or National, exclusively on party grounds, I would feel bound to decline 
the same ; but should either or both think proper to do so, leaving me 
free to act on the grounds I have taken, I should have no hesitation in accepting; this however I do not expect 
</p><p>
I now consider myself in the hands of the people who can dispose of me 
as they may think best; let them & those who brought me forward for the 
presidency drop me, or cast their votes for some one else at the proper 
time ; which they ought to do, if a more available candidate can be 
selected, & one better qualified to serve the country ; & if he should be 
elected, I shall be neither disappointed or mortified at the result ; on the 
contrary if he is honest, truthful & patriotic, qualities unfortunately for 
the country, not always to be met with in those filling high places, I shall 
be more than satisfied 
</p><p>
I am hoping the boy Westley will subject you to no inconvenience 
and that his disease, palpitation of the heart, will not be found to 
be incurable 
</p><p>
I regret there was any difficulty about the horses, at the same time I 
am satisfied Majr Tompkins or the Q r Master who attended to this mat 
ter acted correctly ; & I am pleased with the course you have pursued in 
the matter ; the difficulty lay or grew out of my instructions not being 
attended to at the plantation 
</p><p>
I have been confined to the house for the last four weeks with some 
thing like rheumatism, or a severe pain in the leg, confined exclusively to 
the muscles ; the pain not being always accute, but occasionally so much so 
as to prevent me from putting my foot to the floor, & barely enough so, 
to keep me awake during the greater part of the night ; I am much bet 
ter but far from being entirely recovered ; I shall however leave to-morrow 
for Woodville, & expect to be absent from here about a week, & immediately on my return will go to the plantation ; if well enough to do so 
Mr Garnett the aid of Gen Brook got here day before yesterday, & 
will leave by the first Boat for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> ; he seperated from the Gen 
at Cumberland ; he the Gen going by Pittsburg, he continue on the direct 
route by Wheeling ; the Gen he says may be looked for daily 
</p><p>
Mrs Taylor is improving in health, Betty is quite well well, Dick is at 
the plantation, & was in good health when last heard from 
</p><p>
M" Taylor & Betty join me in love to Ann & the girls, & accept 
our best wishes for the continued health & prosperity of you & yours 
through a long life Your 
</p><p>
Sincere Friend

I have no objection to your copying so much of my letter in relation to the presidency in reply to Mr Hunts as regards the same, & for 
ward it to him, which he is authorized to submit to any of his, or my 
friends, but not for publication in any of the newspapers ; as I do not 
wish to have any concealments on this subject 
</p><p>
I hope you hear from the boys & that they are getting on very well, 
or as much so as you ought to calculate on
