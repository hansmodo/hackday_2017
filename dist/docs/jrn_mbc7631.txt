<a rel='month origin' value='4'>April</a> <a rel='day origin' value='29'>29th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. A grand smash, the news from New Orleans fatal to us. Met Mr. Weston. He wanted to know 
where he could find a place of safety for two hundred negroes. I looked into his face to see if he were in earnest; 
then to see if he were sane. There was a certain set of two hundred negroes that had grown to be a nuisance. Apparently all the white men of the family had felt bound to stay at home to take care of them. There are people 
who still believe negroes property like Noah's neighbors, who insisted that the Deluge would only be a little shower 
after all.

These negroes, however^ were Plowden Weston's, a to tally different part of speech. He gave field-rifles to one 
company and forty thousand dollars to another. He is away with our army at Corinth. So I said: " You may 
rely upon Mr. Chesnut, who will assist you to his uttermost in finding a home for these people. Nothing belonging to 
that patriotic gentleman shall come to grief if we have to take charge of them on our own place. Mr. Chesnut did 
get a place for them, as I said he would.

Had to go to the Governor's or they would think we had hoisted the black flag. Heard there we are going to 
be beaten as Cortez beat the Mexicans by superior arms. Mexican bows and arrows made a poor showing in the face 
of Spanish accoutrements. Our enemies have such superior weapons of war, we hardly any but what we capture from 
them in the fray. The Saxons and the Normans were in the same plight.

War seems a game of chess, but we have an unequal f number of pawns to begin with. We have knights, kings, 
queens, bishops, and castles enough. But our skilful Generals, whenever they can not arrange the board to suit them 
exactly, burn up everything and march away. We want them to save the country. They seem to think their whole 
duty is to destroy ships and save the army.

Mr. Robert Barnwell wrote that he had to hang his head for South Carolina. We had not furnished our quota 
of the new levy, five thousand men. To-day Colonel Chesnut published his statement to show that we have sent thir 
teen thousand, instead of the mere number required of us ; so Mr. Barnwell can hold up his head again.
