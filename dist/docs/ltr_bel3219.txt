GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
I marched from Manchester to <a href='/results.php?city=pawlet' rel='city'>Pawlet</a>, with the troops who 
had joined me, on Monday/ the 8th. On the 14th, a party of 
five hundred men, commanded by Colonel Brown, was ordered to 
cross the Narrows in South Bay, and march for the Landing at 
the north end of Lake George, to destroy the enemy's boats 
and stores, and relieve a number of our men, prisoners there ; 
and if, upon inquiry, he found an attempt upon <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> 
might be made without risking too much, he was to do it. A 
like number was sent to Mount Independence, under Colonel Johnson, in order to divert, at least, the enemy there, and take 
off their attention from our real object, and to attack it, if a 
favorable opportunity should offer. At the same time, another 
party of about five hundred was sent, under Colonel Woodbridge, 
to Skenesborough, who were to cover Colonel Brown, and march 
on towards <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a>, and give the enemy a diversion in that 
quarter. 
</p><p>
The success Colonel Brown hath met with, you learn by the 
inclosed, which is a copy of his letter to me. He hath acted 
with great spirit, and informs me that his officers and men have 
behaved with bravery. General Warner is with Colonel Johnson, 
at the Mount, and hath the general direction of the three parties, 
lie informs me, that no opportunity hath offered by which he 
might attack the lines at Mount Independence with a probability 
of success. I feel myself very happy in having him there, for I 
have the greatest confidence in his prudence, fortitude, and zeal. 
General Bayley, who was Colonel Bayley in the last war, of the 
State of New Hampshire, now on the Grants, an experienced, 
good officer, is left at Castleton, in the neighbourhood of the enemy, and will forward supplies, and join the troops, if necessary. 
</p><p>
I moved, on Wednesday, the 17th, to Skenesborough, and 
marched that way about seven hundred men, with an intention to 
move towards the North River; but the day after, before the 
troops reached me there, I had information from <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, 
that the enemy had abandoned all their posts in their rear ; and 
proposed I should fall on the enemy's left flank. I immediately 
remarched the seven hundred men on their way back, near to 
<a href='/results.php?city=pawlet' rel='city'>Pawlet</a>. The next day, by two expresses, I received <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates's</a> orders to take post at Stillwater; for the enemy had not 
only abandoned the posts in their rear, but had broken down all 
the bridges immediately on passing them, which evidenced <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne's</a> intention to move forward, at all events. 
</p><p>
I left <a href='/results.php?city=pawlet' rel='city'>Pawlet</a> the day before yesterday (Sunday), arrived here 
last night, and expect the troops in this evening or in the morning, twelve or fourteen hundred. The number sent out is far short of what I expected. There hath been in the Grants but 
about three thousand, including three small regiments of Continental troops, the rangers from the Grants and part of their militia, the militia from Berkshire, who came for twenty days only, 
with all the Massachusetts three months men. 
</p><p>
The prisoners taken at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> may soon be expected at 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, to which place <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> hath ordered them. An 
attack on this post, from the enemy, is hourly expected.
