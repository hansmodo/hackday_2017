Sunday afternoon. Friend Henshaw has just gone into his own room to take a nap and is playing on a flute most diabolically, so I thought I would give you some scenes from life in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a>.
</p><p>
This morning we went to Dr. Mason's church in Bleeker Street and after dinner came to the conclusion one such sermon was as much as a man could well digest in one day. The weather is cold as November but I have a fire place in my room and we have got up quite a decent fire out of an old book case and some cigar boxes, so we have been laying off at home.
</p><p>
I formerly had a front room and used to amuse myself with watching a gambling house opposite where Sam Suydam holds out and I could write some of the mysteries of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a> if I should set out. Since my return I occupy a room in the rear where I have a more interesting field of view, comprising the rear of four large houses that front on 'Park Place.' They give me all the chance in the world, for they don't close their shutters. Directly opposite my window is the room of Mrs. Abbott, a
well-known actress at the Broadway Theatre. She is a widow and there are a couple of young snobs in her room, one playing on the piano. Her room appears to be fitted up with great taste.
</p><p>
The room beneath contains a new-married couple, I think.
</p><p>
The next house below has one room where a family lives. I see a very pretty girl sitting in the window who is lame. She is apparently during the week making dolls. Whether to sell or amuse herself, I don't know. Her father looks like a Frenchman.
</p><p>
Underneath is the office of a French newspaper, where a confounded printing press keeps click-clacking all night, Sundays and all.
</p><p>
In the next house above, you might see two women who look much disturbed. The reason I will give you. Henshaw and myself, while quietly smoking about an hour ago, observed the two old maids (for I can tell one at any distance) holding a consultation, and the Devil instantly put it into our heads to disturb their peace of mind. We have a long tube with which we can propel a putty ball a long distance, as true as a gun. The first shot struck the window--slap!--which caused them to draw back and probably utter a short shriek. We had our blinds closed so they could not see us and we could see every motion of theirs. One of them got up, put on her spectacles and looked at the window. While she was looking, we slapped the window again. All at once she started and went up stairs. We saw her come into the room above where were two Bridgets most innocently reading. I could see by her motions that she laid it to them. In order to clear them we hit their window. She was now completely astonished, shoved up the window, looked all round. Sent one of the girls after a spy-glass and commenced spying at a house above us. While she
was leaning out the window, we fired one which struck within an inch of her nose. Heavens! How black she looked. She drew back, shut down the window and folded her hands in despair. All this was very amusing to us. It was one of the best pantomimes that I ever have seen. The two worthies are now sitting in their old place, looking at the stains of putty on the glass and then racking their brains to discover somebody and vowing vengeance no doubt. However, I think we have worried them enough.

I have lately provided myself with quite a lot of books and stay at home most of my evenings. The first of November I am going to dancing school and also begin to study French. The dancing school will be an amusement and the rest of the time I will study. I really don't know what to do with myself when night comes and throw away my time in the most foolish manner, always attended with some expense too. I think it will be cheaper and better to do what I propose. I should like to join some singing society besides, and think I shall.
