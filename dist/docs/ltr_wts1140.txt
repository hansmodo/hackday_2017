Dear Brother: I am just back from Columbus, Ky., 
where I went to meet <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wts" rel="colleague met">Gen. Grant</a>. I start on Wednesday, with all the troops that can be spared from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a>, 
to co-operate with Grant against the enemy now enforced behind the Tallahatchee, about 60 miles S.E. of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a>. Grant may have about 35,000 and I shall 
take 17,000. Our old regiments are very small, and I 
am sorry to learn that no recruits are ready to fill them 
up. So much clamor was raised about the draft that 
I really was led to believe there was something in it, 
but now I suppose it was one of those delusions of which 
the papers are so full. Your letter of the 16th is before 
me. I could write a good deal on the points that you 
make, but hardly have time to do tiem justice. The 
late election doesn't disturb me a particle. The people 
have so long been accustomed to think they could accomplish anything by a vote, that they still think so ; but 
now a vote is nothing more than a change and will 
produce no effect. The war might have been staved off 
a few years, or the issue might have been made up more 
clearly, or the first enthusiasm of the country might 
have been better taken advantage of ; but these are now 
all past, and fault-finding will do no good. We are 
involved in a war that will try the sincerity of all 
our professions of endurance, courage and patriotism. 
Leaders will of course be killed off by the score. Thousands will perish by the bullet or sickness; but war 
must go on it can't be stopped. The North must rule 
or submit to degradation and insult forevermore. The 
war must now be fought out. The President, Congress, 
no earthly power can stop it without absolute submission. . . . 
</p><p>
Of course I foresaw all these complications at the 
outset, and was amused at the apathy of the country 
after the South had begun the war by the seizure of 
arsenals, forts, mints and public property, and still more 
at the call for 75,000 volunteers, when a million was the 
least that any man who had ever been South would have 
dreamed of. These half-way measures at the start only 
add labor in the end. . . .

McClernand is announced as forming a grand army to 
sweep the Mississippi, when, the truth is, he is in 
Springfield, 111., trying to be elected to the U. S. Senate. 
I believe at this moment we have more men under pay 
at home than in the field, and suppose there is no help 
for it. If you want to make a good law, make a simple 
one, " No work, no pay." No pay unless on duty at the 
place where the army is. That would save tens of 
millions per annum. 
</p><p>
I leave here the day after to-morrow for Tchullahoma, 
to communicate with Grant at Holly Springs. Our joint 
forces should reach near 50,000 men, but sickness and 
other causes will keep us down to about 40,000. 
Yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
