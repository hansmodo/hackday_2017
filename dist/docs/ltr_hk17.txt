Sunnyvale, Calif. <br> Nov. 18, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1918">1918</a> Monday <br><br> My Dear Horace, <br> Yours of Oct 22nd rec’d I can’t begin to tell you how thankful we were to learn 
that you were still improving and now we know that if you were not sent back to 
the ranks there is no longer need of your services. There has been great rejoicing 
the whole length and breadth of the land. People went fairly wild no business 
was done for one whole day and long into the night. The paper stated the Chinese 
laundryman let off $500 worth of firecrackers. That was a fine piece of good luck 
to find some one from Algona even if you never knew him before. I rather think 
your friend Oscar did not get a chance to ever make a trip east. The Govt. will 
release about 30,000 a week of the drafted men. A number-did not state- of convalescent 
soldiers were brought to the Presidio last week. (unintelligible) Cuttler of M.V. 
is amoung them. It is hoped that America will never again find it necessary to 
help civilize the world with guns and sword. We have paid a fearful price and 
it is to be hoped that the job is thoroughly done. We have had a steady down pour 
of rain since 6 o’clock Sunday night. Looks very much like the beginning of the 
Winter rains. We are pretty well ready and we need lots of water in the ground 
since the September rains the roses and all flowers have been so beautiful. Just 
like spring. Pa has hauled out the greatest lot of stuff from about the farm and 
has all his little ditches made as you know he likes to do. Charlie Kernble si 
somewhere near you. He is in Co. F. His mother sent the address for me to send 
to you. I believe they have not heard for very long time and are very anxious 
as we were and are thru the silent weeks. <br><br> As ever your loving mother Sarah King
