DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your obliging favour of the 12th instant. Your 
sentiments of the importance of the present dispute between 
Great Britain and the colonies appear to me extremely just. 
There is nothing I wish for more, than to see it amicably and 
equitably settled. 
</p><p>
But <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> will bring about its own ends by its own 
means ; and if it intends the downfall of a nation, that nation 
will be so blinded by its pride and other passions, as not to 
see its danger, or how its fall may be prevented. 
</p><p>
Being born and bred in one of the countries, and having 
lived long and made many agreeable connections of friendship in the other, I wish all prosperity to both; but I have 
talked and written so much and so long on the subject, that my acquaintance are weary of hearing, and the public of 
reading any more of it, which begins to make me weary of 
talking and writing; especially as I do not find that I have 
gained any point, in either country, except that of rendering 
myself suspected by my impartiality ; in England, of being 
too much an American, and in America, of being too much an 
Englishman. Your opinion, however, weighs with me, and 
encourages me to try one effort more, in a full, though concise statement of facts, accompanied with arguments drawn 
from those facts ; to be published about the meeting of Parliament, after the holidays. If any good may be done I shall 
rejoice ; but at present I almost despair. 
</p><p>
Have you ever seen the barometer so low as of late? 
The 22d instant, mine was at 28'41, and yet the weather fine 
and fair. With sincere esteem, I am, dear friend, yours 
</p><p>
affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
