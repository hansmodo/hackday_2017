SIR, 
</p><p>
Ever since my arrival in this quarter, I have been endeavouring to collect the best idea I could of the state of things in 
New- York, in order the better to form a judgment of the probable reinforcement gone to General Howe. On the whole, 
this is a fact well ascertained, that New- York has been stripped as bare as possible ; that in consequence of this, the few 
troops there and the inhabitants are under so strong apprehensions of an attack, as almost to amount to a panic ; that 
to supply the deficiency of men, every effort is making to excite the citizens to arms for the defence of the city. For this 
purpose, the public papers are full of addresses to them, that 
plainly speak the apprehensions prevailing on the occasion. 
</p><p>
Hence I infer that a formidable force is gone to General 
Howe. The calculations made by those who have had the 
best opportunities of judging, carry the number from six to 
seven thousand. If so, the number gone and going to <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> is far inferior. five thousand at the utmost. 
The militia were all detained by <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a>, till it became too late to send them. 
</p><p>
The state of things I gave you when I had the pleasure of 
seeing you, was, to the best of my judgment, sacredly true. 
I give you the present information, that you may decide whether any farther succour can with propriety come from you. 
</p><p>
The fleet, with the troops on board, sailed out of the Hook 
the 5th instant. This circumstance demonstrates, beyond 
a possibility of doubt, that it is General Howe's fixed intention 
to endeavour to hold <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> at all hazards, and removes 
all danger of any farther operations up the North river this 
winter; otherwise Sir Henry Clinton's movement at this 
advanced season is altogether inexplicable. 
</p><p>
If you can with propriety afford any farther assistance, the 
most expeditious mode of conveying it, will be to acquaint <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a> of it, that he may send on the troops with him, 
to be replaced by them. You, sir, best know the uses to 
which the troops with you are to be applied, and will determine accordingly. I am certain it is not his excellency's wish 
to frustrate any plan you may have in view for the benefit of 
the service, so far as it can possibly be avoided, consistent 
with a due attention to more important objects. 
</p><p>
I am, with respect, sir, your most obedient, 
</p><p>
ALEX. HAMILTON, A. D. C.
