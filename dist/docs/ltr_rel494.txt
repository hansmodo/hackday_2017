Arlington, Virginia, April 20, 1861.
<p></p>
General:  Since my interview with you on the 18th inst. I have felt
that I ought no longer to retain my commission in the Army.  I therefore
tender my resignation, which I request you will recommend for
acceptance.  It would have been presented at once but for the struggle
it has cost me to separate myself from a service to which I have devoted
the best years of my life, and all the ability I possessed.
<p></p>
During the whole of that time--more than a quarter of a century--I
have experienced nothing but kindness from my superiors and a most
cordial friendship from my comrades.  To no one, <a href="/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague met friend">General</a>, have I been
as much indebted as to yourself for uniform kindness and consideration,
and it has always been my ardent desire to merit your approbation.  I
shall carry to the grave the most grateful recollections of your kind
consideration, and your name and fame shall always be dear to me.
<p></p>
Save in the defense of my native State, I never desire again to draw my sword.
<p></p>
Be pleased to accept my most earnest wishes for the continuance of
your happiness and prosperity, and believe me most truly yours,
<p></p>
                                         (Signed)
<p>
