SIR, 
</p><p>
I make no doubt but your Excellency is acquainted with the present ineffective state of the cavalry. 
In this situation it cannot be appropriated to any other service than that of orderlies, or reconnoitering 
the enemy's lines, which your Excellency must be 
persuaded is not the only service expected from a 
corps, which, when on a proper footing, is so very 
formidable. Although it is the opinion of many, that, 
from the construction of the country, the cavalry can 
not act to advantage, your Excellency must be too 
well acquainted with the many instances wherein the 
cavalry have been decisively serviceable, to be of this 
opinion, and not acknowledge that this corps has more 
than once completed victories. To this end I would 
wish to discipline the cavalry ; and I flatter myself by 
next campaign to render it essentially serviceable. 
</p><p>
What has greatly contributed to the present weak 
state of the cavalry was, the frequent detachments 
ordered to the suite of general and other officers, 
while a Colonel commanded, which were appropriated 
to every use, and the horses drove at the discretion 
of the dragoons. 
</p><p>
The confidence, with which the Congress and your Excellency have honored me, is a sure guaranty to 
the zeal I shall ever act with, in the service of the 
United States. But, notwithstanding my great desire 
of rendering the cavalry as useful as its first institution intended, I find it impracticable, seeing it is deficient in its principal requisitions ; my reflections on 
which, I have judged necessary to communicate to 
your Excellency, as a proof of my attachment to the 
good of the service, and desire of executing your Excellency's designs ; hoping for an opportunity of 
deserving the favor conferred on me by your Excellency. 
</p><p>
ARTICLE I. It is absolutely necessary, that the cavalry have a Master of Exercise, who should instruct 
the commissioned and non-commissioned officers in the 
rules of service, as, having the command,, I am obliged 
to act with precaution; but this officer, actuated by 
different motives, would remove the bad habits and 
correct the defects of the superior officers. There is 
an officer now in this country, whose name is Kowacz. 
I know him to have served with reputation in the 
Prussian service, and assure your Excellency that he 
is every way equal to this undertaking. 
</p><p>
II. That twenty-four dragoons be drafted from the 
different regiments to form a separate corps, who shall 
be taught the use of the pike or lance, of which two 
or three days will render them masters. For this purpose I must have chosen men. 
</p><p>
III. A Quartermaster-General to the cavalry is essentially necessary to procure winter-quarters, stables, 
and provender, also to provide arms, accoutrements, 
and clothing. An intelligent officer, acquainted with 
the cavalry, should be chosen for this purpose. I 
would recommend to your Excellency, Major Blackden, of Colonel Sheldon's regiment, a gentleman who 
has displayed his knowledge in the equipment of said 
regiment, and whom I think sufficiently qualified to 
merit this trust. 
</p><p>
IV. It is full time the Quartermaster-General was 
sent to the place assigned for winter-quarters, in order to provide magazines, that the cavalry may be 
kept embodied and conveniently exercised and disciplined. The horse service has ever been respected. 
One third of the cavalry is generally on duty, often 
the whole. When it returns to camp, it should draw 
provision, and cook it agreeably to orders ; but their 
full allowance is seldom granted. This I know by 
experience, being the worst served of any General in 
the service. To prevent this evil, a Commissary should 
be appointed to the cavalry. The cavalry in an army 
generally forms a separate division, and has greater 
privileges than the infantry, which the honor of the 
service exacts ; but here I find it is the contrary. Not 
that I aim at a superiority over the rest of the army, 
but am desirous of having justice done the corps I 
command. It is my duty. For my own part I wish to 
be subject to your Excellency's order only, agreeably 
to my request upon entering the service, which is 
the limit of my ambition.
