Sir, 
</p><p>
I am much obliged by your Excellency's long and 
communicative letters of the 9th of July and 6th of 
August. Since my letter of the 26th of August, the 
evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> is reduced to a certainty. 
The following disposition, it is said, is to be made 
of the troops in garrison. 
</p><p>
Lord Rawdon's corps, which is put upon the British 
establishment as the one hundred and fifth regiment, 
is going directly to Ireland. Governor Martin's corps 
is drafted into the North Carolina volunteers, which, 
with the South Carolina royalists, and the King's 
Carolina rangers, and the refugees, are going to St. 
Augustine, to relieve the British troops at that place. 
The Georgia loyalists are incorporated with the King's 
Carolina rangers. It is said these troops are to sail 
on Sunday. After these troops are gone, there will 
remain in <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>; the residue of the guards the 
seventeenth, twenty-third, thirty-third, and seventy-first 
regiments; five companies of the eighty-second; the 
flank companies of The eiglitj-fourth ; a detachment of 
British artillery, the third, sixty-third, and sixty-fourth 
regiments ; the Hessian corps of A Dittforth, and Bening; a detachment of Hessian artillery and 
Yagers ; with the American corps, the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> volunteers, the King's American regiment, the Prince of Wales's regiment, the first and second battalions of 
Delancey's, and the second battalion of New Jersey volunteers. These are to join the troops at New 
York; but whether at that place, or on their passage 
to some other port, is uncertain, as it seems to be 
a matter fully established here that New Y'ork is to 
be evacuated. 
</p><p>
What is the object of the British Ministry, or the 
British Commander, in drawing off the troops from 
this country, is difficult to tell. I confess it looks 
like an approaching peace ; and yet I cannot but 
have my doubts. Reports say that Sir Guy Carleton 
is to go to Canada, and that Lord Cornwallis is to 
command in the West Indies. This disposition is 
equivocal, as it points both to war or peace, only upon 
a different plan. Could Great Britain humble the 
pride of France by some lucky stroke, I should not 
be surprised to find them forming new attacks upon 
us. But if they cannot reduce the navy of France, 
they may embrace a peace, as least ruinous to their 
affairs, however mortifying to their pride. 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency on the 12th of August a 
pretty full state of all matters in this quarter, and 
wish your final determination with respect to the disposition of the troops to the southward. I find, by a 
resolution of Congress, no State is to be credited for 
troops not enlisted agreeably to the resolutions of 
Congress on that subject. Whether those men, drafted in North Carolina for eighteen months, will be 
brought into service under these circumstances, I cannot determine. They ought to have been in camp 
long since, if they had marched agreeably to my orders ; but I have not heard of one man being on 
the march. On the contrary, reports say the State 
will not permit them to come. Should these troops 
not come forward, and the others march northwardly, 
it will leave the Southern States exceedingly defenceless, and much exposed even to the inroads of the 
troops in East Florida and the attacks from the Indians. 
</p><p>
On our possessing <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, the fortifications will 
come under consideration. My object would be to 
render it sufficiently strong to protect its trade 
against sudden descents of three or four thousand ; 
but, when a force invades it that is superior to the 
natural strength of the country, it must fall ; and to 
incur a large expense in the fortification, and sacrifice the garrison only to protract its fall for a few 
days, will be neither wise nor prudent. I should recommend, therefore, whenever there appears a force 
sufficient to possess the town by regular approaches, 
to abandon it, and to have the principal magazine of 
the country at Camden. 
</p><p>
To leave the town without any fortifications, will 
render trade so unsafe as to be highly injurious to 
the public finances ; besides, the perpetual alarms to 
which the inhabitants will be constantly exposed, will 
render their situation exceedingly disagreeable. All 
the Southern States are in a deplorable situation, and 
will require a great deal of nursing and care to establish good government and give a proper spur to 
agriculture and commerce. At present there are no 
Courts of Justice in any of the States, and it is dangerous travelling in almost every part of the country. 
from the great number of robbers and private plunderers that infest the roads. From these circumstances your Excellency can judge how feeble must be 
the efforts of a people in this situation, reduced to 
poverty by continual depredations. 
</p><p>
I have received orders from the Secretary of War 
to collect the minds of the officers for the reform of 
the army, agreeably to the resolution of Congress of 
the 7th of August. I have taken the sentiments of 
the officers here, and forwarded them to the respective States, to have the business completed. That part 
of the plan which proposes filling the Staff from the 
retiring officers, I fear will not be found eligible. 
The consideration proposed is by no means a sufficient 
encouragement to induce suitable characters to engage ; 
and if the appointments are confined to the retiring 
officers alone, it may be difficult to find suitable characters. Good Staff-Officers facilitate the operations 
and business of an army greatly, and the want of 
such embarrasses it exceedingly. I am not certain 
that I comprehend the intentions of Congress fully, 
and therefore can say little on the subject. 
</p><p>
This army has been exceedingly sickly in the 
months of August and September, and remains so 
still, as your Excellency will see by the returns. 
The enemy have been equally so. After I wrote to 
you of the enemy's operations to the southward, 
General Gist took one of their galleys. Major Frazer attempted a surprise upon <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a>, but 
was repulsed, with the loss of one officer killed, two 
wounded, and ten or twelve dragoons killed and 
wounded. These are all the military occurrences 
which have happened since that period. I have the 
honor to be, with great respect, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
