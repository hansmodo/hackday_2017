Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honour of transmitting to you herewith enclosed a certified copy of an act of Congress of the 21st 
instant, instructing you to communicate to Mr. St. Saphorin 
the high sense the United States, in Congress assembled, 
entertain of the liberal decision made by his Danish majesty, on the question proposed to his minister by you, 
respecting the ordination of American candidates for holy 
orders in the Episcopal church, commonly called the Church 
of England. 
</p><p>
Congress has been pleased to order me to transmit copies 
of your letter, and the other papers on this subject, to the 
executives of the different States ; and I am persuaded 
they will receive with pleasure this mark of your attention, 
and of his Danish majesty's friendly disposition. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, with great respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Dear sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
