DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The last evening I received the honor of yours of 
the 3d and 4th instant, which has given me great 
pain. Perhaps I may venture to say, that no officer 
is more attentive to orders or more anxious to carry 
them into execution, than I am. When I received your Excellency's orders to march towards King's 
Bridge, nothing could be more agreeable than the 
manoeuvre ; but I cannot say the taking the command of a body of troops, entirely militia, was so. 
It was indeed far otherwise. Before I received your 
Excellency's orders to move myself towards King's 
Bridge, upon the application of the Committee of the 
State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I appointed General Parsons to 
take the command of the troops destined for their 
secret expedition. He gave me his answer in writing , accepting the command in obedience to orders, 
but, at the same time, desiring that his answer might 
remain in writing, that it might appear, that although 
he cheerfully obeyed orders, yet that he considered 
the taking the command of a body of militia for 
such an attempt, to use his own words, as a sacrifice 
of his character. By your Excellency's orders to me, 
his has escaped, but it seems mine is to receive the 
fatal stab. As I feel myself much interested in this 
matter, your Excellency will bear with me to be a little explicit, and to recapitulate the whole expedition. 
Upon my arrival before the fort, I summoned the garrison to surrender, as your Excellency is sensible 
is the practice on the first investing of a place ; and 
this in particular I did at the motion of a gentleman 
before I left <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, as it was supposed the garrison consisted of Hessian troops ; and, from some preceding circumstances, it might answer a very good 
purpose. And although some of the enemy may 
laugh at a fort being summoned, and not taken, I 
believe they will scarcely publish the summons. After this I called a Council of War, as I did in every 
instance of importance during our continuance before 
the fort, and in every one of them the Council were 
unanimous. I have taken the liberty to inclose one of them, to wit, that preceding our remove, by which 
your Excellency will perceive that the landing of 
Lord Percy, to surround us, was not so much as mentioned. 
</p><p>
The facts were briefly these. The troops were 
scattered in a circle of more than eight miles. We had tried to hut them, but the rain, preceding our 
remove, had driven four of <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a>'s regiments from their huts, with the loss of nearly all 
their ammunition. The enemy had sallied, early one 
morning, and surprised one of our out-guards. The 
regiment nearest the place were struck with a panic, 
and had quitted their quarters, leaving their baggage. 
The troops were so scattered as not to be collected 
in less than two or three hours ; in which case, those 
who were quartered within cannon shot of the fort, 
as was the case, would be entirely cut to pieces be 
fore they could be supported. A diffidence and uneasiness were discovered in even the bravest officers. 
In such a situation, and a universal desire to get 
more advantageously quartered, every officer objected 
to a storm, as they apprehended the militia inadequate to such an enterprise. Every purpose, it was 
supposed, would be, and has been ^answered, by the 
troops in their present cantonment, except that of 
reducing the fort. 
</p><p>
lS T o officer could be more anxious to effect some 
thing to purpose than I have been during the expedition here, or more harassed, perplexed, and fatigued, 
with an undisciplined militia ; and if, after all this, 
and having taken every step agreeably to the result 
in the Councils of War, I am to be censured, it is 
truly discouraging. However, if there has been error 
in judgment, we have all been in the dark, except 
some who may be distinguished for their sense and judgment. But, if I am not mistaken in them, their 
military propositions, in some instances, have been as 
laughable as my summons may be. It is not uncommon for those unacquainted with military operations 
to expect as much from undisciplined as disciplined 
troops, if their numbers are considerable ; but, in our 
present case, the officers of artillery, one and all, in 
formed me, that they could not be accountable for 
the artillery, if they were to be covered with militia; 
and every officer, acquainted with service, was wishing 
for a few Continental troops, when our conquest would 
have been easy. 
</p><p>
I thank your Excellency for your secret admonition, but must entreat that you would be pleased to 
let me know who were your Excellency's informers, 
as you were pleased to mention that they were some 
who have been with me. I think, what your Excellency is pleased to mention with respect to the fo 
rage, we are pursuing. I am a little at a loss for your 
final determination, as to my conduct here. In your 
letter of the 3d instant, you are pleased to direct 
that, after fixing a number of troops in this quarter 
and at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, the remainder should immediately 
march forward and join you; and in your letter of 
the 4th, you are pleased to advise some further at 
tempts on the fort. The last night I ordered a large 
scouting party to march, at one o clock this morning, 
from Ward s, to surprise the out-guards near Fort 
Independence, and attempt whatever might appear 
practicable. I have not as yet heard from them. I 
had yesterday ordered some of the troops lower 
down, and to take quarters below "Ward s. I shall 
immediately endeavour to make the necessary arrangement directed by your Excellency, and shall, in 
obedience to your orders, consult Colonel Duer; other-wise I should not do it in military matters, although 
I much esteem him for his good sense and judgment 
in other affairs. It will, most probably, be several 
days before the troops can move, in which time I 
hope to hear again from you; and in the mean time 
I can assure your Excellency, they shall not be idle. 
I thank your Excellency for the leave you have 
been pleased to grant me to ride to New England. 
Nothing but necessity could have induced me to solicit the favor. I shall endeavour to return in about 
four weeks from the time that I leave <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, 
which will give me about two weeks at home. I 
have the honor to be, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most humble servant, 
</p><p>
