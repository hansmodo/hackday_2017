<i>biograper's note</i><p>[October 25th, Grant was placed in command of the Department of the
Tennessee and headquarters were established at Oxford, Miss.
Reinforcements continued to come from the North, and by November 2d,
he was prepared to take the initiative. This, he said, was a great
relief after two and a half months of continued defence over a large
district where every citizen was an enemy. On November 3d, Grant left
Jackson for the campaign against Vicksburg, which did not end until
July 4, <a href="/results.php?year=1863">1863</a>.
</p><p>
Vicksburg was very important to the enemy on account of its position.
It was the only link connecting the parts of the Confederacy separated
by the Mississippi. While held by the enemy, free navigation of the
river was impossible. During the winter of '62 to '63 there were
exceptionally heavy rains and continuous high water on the
Mississippi.

DEAR SISTER:
</p><p>
Yesterday I received a letter from you and the children and one from
Uncle Samuel. To day I learned by telegraph that Father is at Holly
Springs, thirty miles north of here. Julia is there and as I expect
the railroad to be completed to this point by to-morrow I look for them
down. I shall only remain here to-morrow, or next day at farthest; so
that Julia will go immediately back to Holly Springs. It is a pleasant
place and she may as well stay there as elsewhere.
</p><p>
We are now having wet weather. I have a big army in front of me as
well as bad roads. I shall probably give a good account of myself
however notwithstanding all obstacles. My plans are all complete for
weeks to come and I hope to have them all work out just as planned.
</p><p>
For a conscientious person, and I profess to be one, this is a most
slavish life. I may be envied by ambitious persons, but I in turn envy
the person who can transact his daily business and retire to a quiet
home without a feeling of responsibility for the morrow. Taking my
whole department, there are an immense number of lives staked upon my
judgment and acts. I am extended now like a peninsula into an enemy's
country, with a large army depending for their daily bread upon
keeping open a line of railroad running one hundred and ninety miles
through an enemy's country, or, at least, through territory occupied
by a people terribly embittered and hostile to us. With all this I
suffer the mortification of seeing myself attacked right and left by
people at home professing patriotism and love of country, who never
heard the whistle of a hostile bullet. I pity them and a nation
dependent upon such for its existence. I am thankful however that,
although such people make a great noise, the masses are not like them.
</p><p>

To all the other trials that I have to contend against, is added that
of speculators whose patriotism is measured by dollars and cents.
Country has no value with them compared with money. To elucidate this
would take quires of paper. So I will reserve this for an evening's
conversation, if I should be so fortunate as to again get home where I
can have a day to myself.
</p><p>
Tell the children to learn their lessons, mind their Grandma and be
good children. I should like very much to see them. To me they are all
obedient and good. I may be partial but they seem to me to be children
to be proud of.
</p><p>
Remember me to all at home,
</p><p>
Your brother
</p>
ULYS.
