HEADQUARTERS 5th Div. ARMY OF THE TENN.,

CAMP BEFORE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=corinth" rel="city">Corinth</a>, May 31, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1862">1862</a>.

ORDERS No. 30. 
</p><p>
The General commanding 5th Division Eight Wing 
takes this occasion to express to the officers and men of 
his command his great satisfaction with them for the 
courage, steadiness and great industry displayed by them 
during the past month. Since leaving our memorable 
camp at Shiloh we have occupied and strongly entrenched 
seven distinct camps in a manner to excite the admiration and high commendation of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">General Halleck</a>. The 
division has occupied the right flank of the Grand Army, 
thereby being more exposed and calling for more hard 
work and larger guard details than from any other single 
division, and the Commanding General repeats that his 
officers and men have promptly and cheerfully fulfilled 
their duty, have sprung to the musket or spade according to the occasion, and have just reason to claim a large 
share in the honors that are due the whole army for the 
glorious victory terminating at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=corinth" rel="city">Corinth</a> on yesterday, and 
it affords him great pleasure to bear full and willing 
testimony to the qualities of his command that have 
achieved this victory, a victory none the less decisive 
because attended with comparatively little loss of life. 
</p><p>
But a few clays ago a large and powerful rebel army lay 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=corinth" rel="city">Corinth</a> with outposts extending to our very camp at 
Shiloh. They held two railroads extending North and 
South, East and West across the whole extent of their 
country, with a vast number of locomotives and cars to 
bring to them speedily and certainly their reinforcements 
and supplies. They called to their aid all their armies 
from every quarter, abandoning the sea coast and the 
great river Mississippi that they might overwhelm us 
with numbers in the place of their own choosing. They 
had their chosen leaders, men of high education and 
courage, and they dared us to leave the cover of our iron 
clad gunboats to come and fight them in their trenches, 
and the still more dangerous ambuscades of their Southern swamps and forests. Their whole country from 
Eichmond to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a> and from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a> to Mobile 
rang with their taunts and boastings, as to how they 
would immolate the Yankees if they dared to leave the 
Tennessee River. They boldly and defiantly challengedus to meet them at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=corinth" rel="city">Corinth</a>. We accepted the challenge 
and came slowly and without attempt at concealment to 
the very ground of their selection, and they had fled 
away. We yesterday inarched unopposed through the 
burning embers of their destroyed camps and property, 
and pursued them to their swamps till burning bridges 
plainly confessed they have fled and not marched away 
for better ground. It is a victory as brilliant and important as any recorded in history, and any officer or soldier 
who has lent his aid has just reason to be proud of his 
part. No amount of sophistry or words from the leaders 
of the Rebellion can succeed in giving the evacuation of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=corinth" rel="city">Corinth</a> under the circumstances any other title than 
that of a signal defeat, more humiliating to them and 
their cause than if we had entered the place over the 
dead and mangled bodies of their soldiers. We are not 
here to kill and slay, but to vindicate the honor and just 
authority of that Government which has been bequeathed 
to us by our honored fathers, and to whom we would be 
recreant if we permitted their work to pass to our children marred and spoiled by ambitious and wicked rebels. 
The General commanding while thus claiming for his 
division their just share in this glorious result, must at 
the same time remind them that much yet remains to be 
done, and all must still continue the same vigilant patience, industry and obedience till the enemy lay down 
their arms and publicly acknowledge that for their supposed grievances they must obey the laws of their country 
and not attempt its overthrow by threats, by cruelty and 
by war. They must be made to feel and acknowledge 
the power of a just and mighty nation. 
</p><p>
This result can only be accomplished by a cheerful 
and ready obedience to the orders and authority of our 
own leaders, in whom we now have just reason to feel the 
most implicit confidence. That the fifth division of the 
right wing will do this, and that in due time we will all 
go to our families and friends at home, is the earnest 
prayer and wish of your immediate commander.

[The following was written in lead pencil on the same 
sheet:] 
</p><p>
Dear Brother : Of course the telegraph has announced 
the evacuation of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=corinth" rel="city">Corinth</a>. I have sent to General Thomas 
commanding Right Wing my report. You ask for a 
copy. This is wrong, as official reports are the property 
of the War Department. I have sent Ellen the rough 
draft to keep and I have instructed her to make and 
send you a copy. We have had no battle and I cannot 
imagine why Beauregard has declined battle. I was on 
the extreme right and yesterday pushed into the town 
and beyond it, but their army had gone off and I was 
ordered back to this camp. 
</p><p>
Pope and Buell are in pursuit, I understand, around by 
the left, but you will have the result long before you can 
receive this letter. 
</p><p>
I send you a copy of my Division Order which is public, inasmuch as it is issued to my own command. Its 
publication would interest no one, but lest you should 
print it on the supposition that it would interest people, 
I express the wish that it be not published until <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a>'s 
announcement of the abandonment of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=corinth" rel="city">Corinth</a> be first 
made public. 
</p><p>
I cannot imagine what turn things will now take, but 
I do not think <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a> will attempt to pursue far. I 
think that Beauregard cannot now subsist his army or 
hold it together long. 
</p><p>
It must divide to live, and the greatest danger is that 
they will scatter and constitute guerilla bands. The 
people are as bitter against us as ever, but the leaders 
must admit now that they have been defeated. I hope 
all this army with some exceptions will be marched 
forthwith to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a>. A part could be spared for 
Huntsville, Ala., and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, but as to pursuing overland it would be absurd. We want the Mississippi now 
in its whole length and a moment should not be lost. 
I am glad the President has called for more men. He 
cannot have too many, and the more men the sooner the 
work will be done. All is not yet accomplished, although 
certainly great strides have been made. If <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gbm" rel="colleague met">McClellan</a> 
succeeds at Richmond and we can take <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a>, we could 
afford to pause and let events work. Banks' repulse was 
certain. Three converging armies whose point was in 
possession of the enemy was worse generalship than they 
tried to force on me in Kentucky of diverging lines with 
a superior enemy between. Our people must respect the 
well-established principles of the art of war, else successful fighting will produce no results. I am glad you 
are pleased at my report at Shiloh. It possesses the 
merit of truth and you may safely rely on it, for I make 
no points but what I can sustain. Your speech was 
timely and proper for you. You could explain, whereas 
I had to report actual facts without fear or favor. I will 
write when more at leisure. The enemies' works are very 
extensive. They must have had 100,000 men. 
</p><p>
Your brother, 
</p><p>
