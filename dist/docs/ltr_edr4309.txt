Sir, 
</p><p>
I conclude, from what you observed yesterday, that, 
in the nomination of an Envoy Extraordinary to London, you prefer some statement more special than is 
customary in nominations. I beg leave, therefore, to 
present to you a short review of the subject, that 
you may determine whether the occurrences in the 
Legislature are ripe for such a statement. 
</p><p>
I believe that I was among the first, if not the 
first, who suggested this mission to your consideration, and I am still its advocate. I was induced to 
think favorably of the measure, â€” 1. Because the representations made by our Minister in Ordinary, seemed to rest on the British files among the business, 
which, if ever entered upon, would be entered upon 
at extreme leisure. 2. Because the recent accumulation of injuries called for pointed notice. 3. Because the merchants and insurers would suspect an 
inattention in Government, if their interests were left 
to the routine and delays of common affairs, and 
would, on the other hand, be highly gratified by the 
movement. 4. Because the British nation, without 
whose affections the British Minister can do nothing 
of importance in war, ought to be retained, by the 
strongest demonstrations, in the persuasion that we 
mean peaceable negotiation, rather than war. And 
5. Because a distinguished character, sent fresh from 
the feelings of the United States, would with more 
confidence assert, and with more certainty impress. 
</p><p>
I confess that two remarks, which came from yourself, had for some time employed my thoughts. 
These related to the sensations which might be excited in <a href='/results.php?tla=ccp' rel=''>Mr. Pinckney</a>, and to those which may be 
excited in the people of our country. To wound unnecessarily a valuable and meritorious officer, as <a href='/results.php?tla=ccp' rel=''>Mr. Pinckney</a> is, may be affirmed to be a public mischief But this will not be the case, I hope. He 
will admit, that on great occasions, such missions are 
often instituted; that they are never interpreted by 
the diplomatic world as a disparagement of the Minister Resident ; and that a step of so much eclat will 
rouse the British Court from their profound slumber 
over our various applications. He may, moreover, receive such declarations of continuing confidence, as to 
calm little possible inquietudes. 
</p><p>
The same kind of considerations will satisfy the 
animadversions of our citizens. For if a man, the 
most conspicuous for talents and character, were now 
the stationary representative of the United States at 
London, the efficacy of a solemn and special mission 
may still, upon the foregoing principles, be easily 
conceived. And yet, the difference between one grade 
and another is not so powerful as of itself to secure 
a difference of reception to our demands. The Envoy 
will be impotent, if he is to carry with him only the 
language of rhetoric or of menaces, without the power of revenge. To fulfil the purpose of his creation, he 
must show that the United States can and will vindicate their rights. But measures of this kind depend on Congress alone, and from them we have the 
embargo alone. They are employed in discussions 
leading to these objects. To nominate an Envoy immediately, or until you see the nature and extent of 
the preparations, may perhaps be to nominate a useless officer; and if, by such a nomination, it is proposed to give a direction to the views and deliberations of Congress, may it not be better to send a 
message to them, urging them to adopt the preparatory steps, than to run the risk of appointing a gentleman, who, if our state of imbecility is to remain, 
cannot, except from personal qualities, have more influence than <a href='/results.php?tla=ccp' rel=''>Mr. Pinckney</a>? It would be unusual, 
too, to expect, by an act done to the Senate in its 
Executive capacity, that its influence should extend 
to the other House in its Legislative. 
</p><p>
I believe, indeed, that to postpone the nomination, 
will be attended with two advantages. The one is, 
that after Congress shall have given nerve to our 
affairs, the propriety of the mission will no longer be 
questionable ; nor will it require those arguments, 
which, in the present state of things, will not be sufficiently apparent. The other is, that the person nominated will then be able to decide, whether he 
would choose to be the missionary, after certain acts 
of Congress. For example, it might accord with the 
opinions of some gentlemen to go, with an act of 
sequestration in their hands. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the suspension of the nomination, 
you may perhaps approve of mentioning, in the mean 
time, your intention eventually to the person whom 
you contemplate. I must request your instruction, 
whether I am to prepare the message to the Senate 
immediately. 
</p><p>
I have the honor, Sir, to he, &c.,
