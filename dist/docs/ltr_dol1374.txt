I have great pleasure, my beloved, in repeating to you what the doctor has just 
told me that I may reasonably hope to leave this place in a fortnight ; I am so 
impatient to be restored to you. I wish you would indulge me with some information respecting the war with Spain, and 
the disagreement with England, which is (generally expected. You know I am 
not much of a politician, but I am extremely anxious to hear (as far as you 
think proper) what is going forward in the Cabinet. On this subject, I believe you 
would not desire your wife to be the active partisan that our neighbor is, Mrs. L., nor will there be the slightest danger, 
while she is conscious of her want of talents, and the diffidence in expressing those 
opinions, always imperfectly understood by her sex. Kiss my child for me, and remember me to my friends. Adieu, my dear 
husband. Peter brings me no letter from you, which really unfits me from writing 
more to any one.

Your ever affectionate <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=dol" rel="me">DOLLY</a>.
