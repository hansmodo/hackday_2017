Nobody has been hurt after all. How gay we were last night. Reaction after the dread of all the 
slaughter we thought those dreadful cannon were making. Not even a battery the worse for wear. Fort Sumter has 
been on fire. Anderson has not yet silenced any of our guns. So the aides, still with swords and red sashes by 
way of uniform, tell us. But the sound of those guns makes regular meals impossible. None of us go to table. 
Tea-trays pervade the corridors going everywhere. Some of the anxious hearts lie on their beds and moan in solitary 
misery. Mrs. Wigfall and I solace ourselves with tea in my room. These women have all a satisfying faith. God 
is on our side," they say. When we are shut in Mrs. Wigfall and I ask " Why? " " Of course, He hates the Yankees, we are told. You ll think that well of Him."

Not by one word or look can we detect any change in the demeanor of these negro servants. Lawrence sits at 
our door, sleepy and respectful, and profoundly indifferent. So are they all, but they carry it too far. You could 
not tell that they even heard the awful roar going on in the bay, though it has been dinning in their ears night and 
day. People talk before them as if they were chairs and tables. They make no sign. Are they stolidly stupid ? or . 
wiser than we are ; silent and strong, biding their time ?

So tea and toast came; also came Colonel Manning, red sash and sword, to announce that he had been under fire, 
and didn't mind it. He said gaily: " It is one of those things a fellow never knows how he will come out until he 
has been tried. Now I know I am a worthy descendant of 
my old Irish hero of an ancestor, who held the British officer before him as a shield in the Revolution, and backed 
out of danger gracefully." We talked of St. Valentine's eve, or the maid of Perth, and the drop of the white doe's 
blood that sometimes spoiled all.

The war-steamers are still there, outside the bar. And there are people who thought the Charleston bar " no 
good " to Charleston. The bar is the silent partner, or sleeping partner, and in this fray it is doing us yeoman service.
