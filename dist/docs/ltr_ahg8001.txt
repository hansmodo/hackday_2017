Sir: <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a> has requested me to address you upon the subject of a surgeon being ordered to his command. The daily application of sick alone induces him to urge the necessity 
of his having a medical officer ; and he hopes you will feel that he would not make the request, without being satisfied of your concurrence with the application solely with reference to the 
return of Dr. Henderson to the ship. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague met">Captain Fremont</a> would address you himself, were he not so much occupied, and being away from his writing utensils, which are left at San Rafael. 
</p><p>
We move to San Rafael to-morrow morning. In the meantime we hope to learn your favorable decision as to the foregoing application. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
(Signed) Archi. H. Gillespie, 
</p><p>
Lieut. U. S. Marine Corps, etc., etc. 
To Captain J. B. Montgomery, 
</p><p>
Commanding U. S. Ship Portsmouth, Yerba Buena. 
</p><p>
P.S. â€” I write this in haste on board the Barque Moscow. 
</p><p>
Respectfully, 
(Signed) <a href="/results.php?tla=ahg" rel="me">Archie H. Gillespie</a>.
