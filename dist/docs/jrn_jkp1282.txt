Immediately after twelve o'clock the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy called. The Secretary of the Navy read to me the rough draft of a despatch which he had prepared to Commodore Stockton in the Pacific, defining his rights and powers over the province of the Californias which he had conquered. This despatch embodies the laws of nations on the subject. I assented to the general principles which it embodied. The Secretary of War said he would address a similar communication to General Kearny as applicable to the province of New Mexico, which he had conquered. . . I spent the balance of the day in disposing of the business on my table, and despatched many minor matters which had been on my hands for some time. Indeed, I almost cleared my table.
