<a rel='month origin' value='2'>February</a> <a rel='day origin' value='5'>5th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. When Lawrence handed me my husband's money (six hundred dollars it was) I said: " Now I 
am pretty sure you do not mean to go to the Yankees, for with that pile of money in your hands you must have known 
there was your chance. He grinned, but said nothing.

At the President's reception <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> had a perfect ovation. General Preston navigated him through the crowd, hand 
ling him as tenderly, on his crutches, as if he were the Princess of Wales's new-born baby that I read of to-day. 
It is bad for the head of an army to be so helpless. But old Bliicher went to Waterloo in a carriage, wearing a bonnet 
on his head to shade his inflamed eyes a heroic figure, truly; an old, red-eyed, bonneted woman, apparently, back 
in a landau. And yet, " Bliicher to the rescue! " 
</p><p>
Afterward at the Prestons , for we left the President's at an early hour. Major von B or eke was trying to teach 
them his way of pronouncing his own name, and reciting numerous travesties of it in this country, when Charles 
threw open the door, saying, " A gentleman has called for Major Bandbox." The Prussian major acknowledged this 
to be the worst he had heard yet.

Off to the Ives's theatricals. I walked with General Breckinridge. Mrs. Clay's Mrs. Malaprop was beyond our 
wildest hopes. And she was in such bitter earnest when she pinched Conny Gary's (Lydia Languish s) shoulder and 
called her " an antricate little huzzy," that Lydia showed she felt it, and next day the shoulder was black and blue. 
It was not that the actress had a grudge against Conny, but that she was intense. 
</p><p>
Even the back of Mrs. Clay's head was eloquent as she walked away. " But," said General Breckinridge, 
!&lt; watch <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a>; he has not seen the play before and Bob Acres amazes him." W^en he caught my eye, <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>General Hood</a> nodded to me and said, " I believe that fellow Acres is a coward." " That's better than the play," whispered 
Breckinridge, " but it is all good from Sir Anthony down to Fag." 
</p><p>
Between the acts Mrs. Clay sent us word to applaud. She wanted encouragement; the audience was too cold. 
General Breckinridge responded like a man. After that she was fired by thunders of applause, following his lead. 
Those mighty Kentuckians turned claqueurs, were a host in themselves. Constance Gary not only acted well, but 
looked perfectly beautiful. 
</p><p>
During the farce Mrs. Clay came in with all her feathers, diamonds, and fallals, and took her seat by me. Said 
General Breckinridge, "What a splendid head of hair you have." " And all my own," said she. Afterward she said, 
they could not get false hair enough, so they put a pair of black satin boots on top of her head and piled hair over 
them. 
</p><p>
We adjourned from Mrs. Ives's to Mrs. Quid's, where we had the usual excellent Richmond supper. We did not 
get home until three. It was a clear moonlight night almost as light as day. As we walked along I said to General Breckinridge, " You have spent a jolly evening." I do not know, he answered. "I have asked myself more than 
once to-night, Are you the same man who stood gazing down on the faces of the dead on that awful battle-field? 
The soldiers lying there stare at you with their eyes wide open. Is this the same world ? Here and there ?

Last night, the great Kentucky contingent came in a body. <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> brought Buck in his carriage. She said she did not like <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>General Hood</a>, and spoke with a wild excitement in those soft blue eyes of hers or, are they gray or 
brown ? She then gave her reasons in the lowest voice, but loud and distinct enough for him to hear: Why? 
He spoke so harshly to Cy, his body-servant, as we got out of the carriage. I saw how he hurt Cy's feelings, and I 
tried to soothe Cy's mortification. 
</p><p>
You see, Cy nearly caused me to fall by his awkwardness, and I stormed at him," said the General, vastly 
amused. " I hate a man who speaks roughly to those who dare not resent it," said she. The General did own himself 
charmed with her sentiments, but seemed to think his wrong-doing all a good joke. He and Cy understand each other.
