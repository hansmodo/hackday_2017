MR. ELIOT, of Fairfield, is this moment arrived, on 
his way to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. He read us a letter from the Doctor, his father, dated yesterday night, being Sunday, 
The Doctor's description of the melancholy of the town, is enough to melt a stone. The trials of that 
unhappy and devoted people are likely to be severe indeed. God grant that the furnace of affliction may refine them. God grant that they may be relieved from their present distress. 
</p><p>
It is arrogance and presumption, in human sagacity, to pretend to penetrate far into the designs of Heaven. The most perfect reverence and resignation becomes 
us, but I cannot help depending upon this, that the present dreadful calamity of that beloved town, is in 
tended to bind the colonies together in more indissoluble bonds, and to animate their exertions at this great crisis in the affairs of mankind. It has this 
effect in a most remarkable degree, as far as I have yet seen or heard. It will plead with all America with more irresistible persuasion than angels trumpet-tongued. 
</p><p>
In a cause which interests the whole globe, at a time when my friends and country are in such keen distress, I am scarcely ever interrupted in the least 
degree by apprehensions for my personal safety. I am often concerned for you and our dear babes, surrounded, as you are, by people who are too timorous, 
and too much susceptible of alarms. Many fears and jealousies and imaginary dangers will be suggested 
to you, but I hope you will not be impressed by them. In case of real danger, of which you cannot fail to have previous intimations, fly to the woods with our children. Give my tenderest love to them, and to all.
