During the past three weeks I have been steadily engaged in the Times office, working late and early. Last night I worked until twelve o'clock and this morning until nearly noon, for which I shall charge half an ounce. I am promised, by my present employers, a permanent situation after next week in the Herald office at Sonora in the mines.

Yesterday Atkins moved in from the Calaveras where he had been encamped, with our trappings, preparatory to starting for Sonora, whither we are soon going, he to ride express, and I to set type on the Herald.

Through Adams' Express this week I received several letters, all of which I have answered.
