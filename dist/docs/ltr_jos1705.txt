SENATE CHAMBER, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, D.C., April 6, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1886">1886</a>. 
</p><p>
Dear Brother: Yours of the 3d is received. The 
speech of Mr. Corwin, to which you refer, was made in 
the United States Senate on the llth of February, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>, 
on the Mexican War. It is a very long speech, and 
is to be found on pages 211-218. Enclosed is the extract 
you refer to : 
</p><p>
"If I were a Mexican I would tell you, 'Have you no 
room in our own country to bury your dead men?' If 
you come into mine we will greet you with bloody hands, 
and welcome you to hospitable graves." .... 
</p><p>
The speech of Corwin's is worth reading through, 
as it gives fully his idea of the injustice of the war with 
Mexico, which I think was shared by the great body of 
intelligent people in the North, but was opposed by the 
cry " Our country, right or wrong ! " which perhaps after 
war commences is the best public policy. . . . 
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
