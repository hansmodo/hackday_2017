Influenced by motives of delicacy, I have hitherto 
forborne the pleasure, my dear Sir, of writing to you 
since my return from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. I have been apprehensive, that the stages of the business of the 
Convention might leak out, and be made an ill use 
of by some people. I have therefore been anxious 
that you should escape the possibility of imputation. 
But, as the objects seem now to be brought to a 
point, I take the liberty to indulge myself in communicating with you. 
</p><p>
Although I frankly confess that the existence of 
the State Governments is an insuperable evil in a 
national point of view, yet I do not well see how, in 
this stage of the business, they could be annihilated ; 
and perhaps, while they continue, the frame of Government could not, with propriety, be much higher 
toned than the one proposed. It is so infinitely preferable to the present Constitution, and gives such a 
bias to a proper line of conduct in future, that I 
think all men, anxious for a National Government, 
should zealouslv embrace it. 
</p><p>
The education, genius, and habits of men on this 
Continent, are so various, even at this moment, and 
of consequence their views of the same subject so 
different, that I am satisfied with the result of the 
Convention, although it is short of my wishes and of 
my judgment. But, when I find men of the purest 
intentions concur in embracing a system, which, on 
the highest deliberation, seems to be the best which 
can be obtained under present circumstances, I am 
convinced of the propriety of its being strenuously 
supported by all those who have wished for a National Republic of higher and more durable powers. 
I am persuaded that the address of the Convention, 
to accompany their propositions, will be couched in 
the most persuasive terms. I feel anxious that there 
should be the fullest representation in Congress, in 
order that the propositions should receive their warmest concurrence and strongest impulse.

Mrs. Knox and myself have recently sustained the 
severe affliction of losing our youngest child, of about 
eleven months old, who died on the 11th instant, of 
a disease incident to children cutting their teeth in 
the summer season. This is the third time that Mrs. 
Knox has had her tenderest affections lacerated by 
the rigid hand of death. Although her present grief 
is sharp indeed, we hope it will be assuaged by the 
lenient hand of time. I am, my dear Sir,

With the most perfect respect and affection, &c.,
