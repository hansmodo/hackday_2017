My dear Dr 
</p><p>
Your several letters of the i i th 15th  & iy th ins 1 have all been rec d the 
contract in the case of the Surg n employed, has been signed by Dr Craig 
& app d by me, & will be forwarded by the Dr An order was given 
before I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoros" rel="city">Matamoros</a> to provide large accommodation for the sick, & 
an order was given some days since to leave all the sick volunteers at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoros" rel="city">Matamoros</a> which orders & arrangements I had hoped, in addition to 
what accommodations you could furnish at Fort Polk, would have met 
the wants of the sick, which as a matter of course must be very numerous ; & humanity as well as duty ought to prompt us to do all in our 
power to alleviate their sufferings as much as possible. As I learn the 
yellow fever has made its appearance in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a>, through which it 
would not be proper to send the volunteers while such was the case who 
might leave the army on ace of feeble or broken dow health, such ought 
to remain here or in the country until there is no danger from that contageous disease, as most of them have to pass through that place on their 
way to their homes. I hope an abundant supply of every thing in the 
way of medicine, hospital &c have & will be sent out, so as there will be 
no just complaints on that ground ; so far as my authority would go in 
the way of orders, ample provisions have been made for the sick. Dr 
Craig has not been cramped in regard to hiring houses, physicians or any 
thing els to make the sick comfortable at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoros" rel="city">Matamoros</a> ; I have done all I 
could in the matter.

We have had a large accession of Militia Genl s recently in addition 
to Pillow & Quitman, Majr Gen Butler & B rs Hamer 1 & Shields have 
just arrived, the latter returns immediately to his camp, the Illinois volunteers, near the mouth of the river, & B r Gen Marshall 1 is expected by the first boat from below ; so there will be no lack of Genl 8 I could 
have myself wished they had not been quite so numerous ; the Volunteers are with the exception of one Reg are all here or below & there is 
doubts whether that Reg will come or not. 
</p><p>
It seems to me had Ann been satisfied with her position <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Detroit" rel="city">Detroit</a>, it 
would have been well for her to have continued there until you could 
have joined her, as breaking up & removing is generally attended with 
considerable expense ; but you done right in leaving it entirely to her to 
leave or remain as she thought best. I regretted to learn that she had 
changed her mind on the subject of your going out for a short time, & 
then returning as I considered the conclusions she arrived at in the 
instance, were very judicious. At Buffalo no doubt you had every thing 
very comfortable, as much so as could have been desired, but I see no 
reason why that should not again be case ; I consider it a great misfor 
tune to be always looking at the dark side of the picture of life or to be 
anticipating evils or misfortunes 
</p><p>
It is unnecessary to animadvert on the Q r Masters dep 1 the system 
is certainly a bad one, & a large portion of its officers feeble, & would 
be so in any relations of life, but which is more apparent in their present 
positions, which requires so much energy & decision than in many other 
profession or pursuit. Should I ever get away from here which I hope 
to do about the fifth of next month I shall be very deficient in transportation to what it should have been ; but I must attempt something ; we 
have been idle too long & we must move on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> be the consequences what they may 
</p><p>
I fear the enemy will not fight us for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>, or in force any 
where else unless we penetrate far beyond there or Saltillo ; I believe a 
Gen battle if we beat them which I will not permit myself to doubt, 
would do more to bring about a peace, than any thing else ; my greatest 
apprehensions are that they will avoid us in force, attempt to harrass us 
in small parties, attack our trains, attempting to cut off our suplies at 
favorable positions, destroy the corn, & drive away the stock ; in which 
cas we would have to fall back on our supplies near to our depots on the 
water ; all of which cannot be ascertained without marching into the 
their country. A report has reached here, & generally believed that a 
recent revolution had taken place in Mexico, which had resulted in the 
overthrow of the gov f of Perades by what are termed the Federal party, 
that his army had revolted, made him prisoner, & delivered him into the 
hands of his opponents. Even if the report be true it is doubtful 
whether or not the change will be a favorable one to us, in the way of 
setling the difficulties between the two countries ; the party coming into 
power may be, & probaly are more hostile towards us than the one just 
put down & may carry on their operation towards us with more energy & 
ability than their predecessors; but time will develop most if not all things 
</p><p>
No one can desire peace more than I do, or can be more anxious 
for quiet, & the enjoyment of domestic life, & notwithstanding the 
honors which have been conferred on me, which are very great, they do 
not compensate for the privations, which I am subjected to, & I would 
willingly forego them all, could peace be restored to our country. It is 
principal alone keeps me here, & alth peace between the two countries 
appears to be as distant as ever, yet I feel bound to forego under the 
circumstances in which I have been placed, every other consideration & 
to carry on the war until brought to a close, or the gov may think 
proper to have me relieved

Gen T. is quite uncertain in his friendships, he is a man that one 
should never place himself in the power of; alth all things considered I 
was gratified at his promotion.

The case of Graham needs no further notice even if actuated by 
enmity or unfriendly feelings, which I have no right to believe is the 
case. I have just rec d a letter from Dick from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> dated the 5th 
ms c he says his own health was not improved, mother & Betty well. 
Mr Reeder had no despatches for me, other than a letter of introduction 
from Gov r Johnson ; he brought out several medals voted by a committee in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> to certain non comm d officers for their gallant conduct 
in the battles of the 8th  & 9th 
</p><p>
Your views & opinions in regard to Saunders 1 coincide pretty much 
with my own. He is a complete party politician & belongs to the most 
unscrupulous sect, that every existed, who are entirely actuated by personal & selfish considerations, in which he goes the whole length, & his 
views and statements so far as prominent political men, or aspirents to 
the presidency are concerned, should be treated with due allowances, & 
with great caution & circumspection. I regret between ourselves he 
returned to the army. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> is a man of strong impulses, both writes & speaks with 
great flipancy & frequently without due reflection as regards both, which 
has gotten him into many serious scrapes ; but he means well on all occasions & is entirely mistaken if he supposes I am unfriendly to him, in 
the slightest manner possible, the reverse being the case. I very much 
regret to hear Col Croghan had come out as I fear he will expect me to 
take care of him & there are people enough of that description already 
here ; at any rate to embarrass me not a little ; I learn he has been in a 
tremendous frolic but will get sober before he gets here & will, expect, 
keep so, while he remains with me. I have not had time to read a paper 
but learn Mr McCoysS or Walkers tariff bill has become a law ; this I 
regret as I am satisfied they will need every cent they can raise in that 
way as long as this war lasts. I presume its effects without being beneficial, will hardly be injurious to the cotton planters ; this consideration 
had no importance or influence as regards my opinion in the matter. I 
am pleased to find you are keeping up a friendly correspondence with 
D r Mower from whose position & intelligence much information may be 
derived from an epistolary correspondence ; & I think the Dr s remarks 
in relation to leaving in part at least judicious. Nor ought such to be 
alluded to unless to a very particular friend. Whenever an officer was 
fully prepared to quit, let him do so, but it is perhaps as well not to 
speak of doing so unless it was to those who would not repeat them 
until such time arrived ; I am sure nothing but kindness was intended in 
any of his remarks. I hope the supplies referred to by him will arrive 
in due season, & that they will be abundant for all concerned. The four 
medical officers coming out with the 2 d Infrwill add very considerably to 
the strength of the corps in the country. Riley 1 I learn has arrived at 
Brasos ; with two or three comp s this however is not official, if true he 
will be here in a few days 
</p><p>
As regards the Callifornia affair, I must entirely disapprove the 
course of the administration, & consider no act of the brittis govt as 
regards the acquirement of territory in the East, or any where else more 
outrageous than our attempt or intention of taking permanent possession 
of that country. I am gratified to know you had recently heard from 
Ann as well as from Puss & thank them for their kind remembrance, & 
hope all is well as nothing is said to the contrary ; give my love to them 
all when you write. I have rec d Gs. communication on the subject of 
rank, he has as well not written it, alth no objection can be made to it, 
yet no action will be had on it ; you are right in giving no advice in the 
matter. The heat here during the greater part of the day could not be 
much greater than it has been, but I had not supposed it could have been 
so very great in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Detroit" rel="city">Detroit</a> ; but it will not continue so there but for a short 
time.

I have always understood that the females of Gen Bradies family 
were rather cold & repulsive, for which they were mainly indebted to an 
old fanitic aunt. Thompson must be very miserable. I regret to hear 
Bob had quit the school his mother placed him at in the country, & fear 
he will give her much trouble. 
</p><p>
Col Taylor when last heard from, was in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoros" rel="city">Matamoros</a> his health 
improved, I presume he is on his way here by this time if not before. 
I do not expect to write you so Ion an an epistle again for some time 
Since my last I have been someweat indisposed but am now much better 
if not entirely well. Wishing you & yours continued health & prosperity I remain with sincere respect & esteem
