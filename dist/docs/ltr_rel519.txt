My Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse sweetheart met">Mary</a>:  This is the first moment I have had to write to you,
and now am waiting the call to breakfast, on my way to Brunswick,
Fernandina, etc.  This is my second visit to Savannah.  Night before
last, I returned to Coosawhatchie, South Carolina, from Charleston,
where I have placed my headquarters, and last night came here, arriving
after midnight.  I received in Charleston your letter from Shirley.
It was a grievous disappointment to me not to have seen you, but better
times will come, I hope....  You probably have seen the operations of
the enemy's fleet.  Since their first attack they have been quiescent
apparently, confining themselves to Hilton Head, where they are
apparently fortifying.
</p><p>
I have no time for more.  Love to all.
</p><p>
                Yours very affectionately and truly,
</p>
                                     <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="me">R. E. Lee.</a>.
