My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have now been here nearly one week, and nothing of importance has been decided upon, owing to 
the contrariety of sentiments concerning the powers 
vested in Congress to raise troops, in time of peace, 
for any purpose. There appears but one sentiment 
respecting the necessity of having troops for the frontiers ; but the difficulty is, how to obtain them. The 
Southern States are generally of opinion that the 
Confederation vests Congress with sufficient powers for this purpose ; but the Eastern States are of a different opinion. The eastern Delegates are willing to 
recommend the raising troops for the western posts. 
But the gentlemen from the southward say this would 
be giving up a right, which is of importance to preserve, and they cannot consent to recommend, when 
they ought to require ; so that, from this cause, it is to 
be feared that there will not be any troops raised; 
and there are many difficulties as to sending those 
which are raised, and at <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, &c. I shall 
stay until the point is finally decided, or until Congress adjourn, provided it be on the 3d of next month, 
as it is agreed. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
