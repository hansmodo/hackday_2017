<a rel='month origin' value='9'>September</a> <a rel='day origin' value='7'>7th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1863' rel="origin">1863</a>]. Major Edward Johnston did not get 
into the Confederacy until after the first battle of Manassas. For some cause, before he could evade that potentate, 
<a href='/results.php?tla=wls' rel=''>Seward</a> rang his little bell and sent him to a prison in the harbor of New York. I forget whether he was exchanged 
or escaped of his own motion. The next thing I heard of my antebellum friend he had defeated Milroy in Western 
Virginia. There were so many Johnstons that for this victory they named him Alleghany Johnston.

He had an odd habit of falling into a state of incessant winking as soon as he became the least startled or agitated. 
In such times he seemed persistently to be winking one eye at you. He meant nothing by it, and in point of fact did 
not know himself that he was doing it. In Mexico he had 
been wounded in the eye, and the nerve vibrates independently of his will. During the winter of 1862 and 1863 he 
was on crutches. After a while he hobbled down Franklin Street with us, we proud to accommodate our pace to that 
of the wounded general. His ankle continued stiff ; so when he sat down another chair had to be put before him. On 
this he stretched out his stiff leg, straight as a ramrod. At that time he was our only wounded knight, and the girls 
waited on him and made life pleasant for him. 
</p><p>
One night I listened to two love-tales at once, in a distracted state of mind between the two. William Porcher 
Miles, in a perfectly modulated voice, in cadenced accents and low tones, was narrating the happy end of his affair. 
He had been engaged to sweet little Bettie Bierne, and I gave him my congratulations with all my heart. It was a 
capital match, suitable in every way, good for her, and good for him. I was deeply interested in Mr. Miles's story, 
but there was din and discord on the other hand ; old Edward, our pet general, sat diagonally across the room with 
one leg straight out like a poker, wrapped in red carpet leggings, as red as a turkey-cock in the face. His head is 
strangely shaped, like a cone or an old-fashioned beehive; or, as Buck said, there are three tiers of it ; it is like a pope's tiara. 
</p><p>
There he sat, with a loud voice and a thousand winks, making love to Mary P. I make no excuse for listening. 
It was impossible not to hear him. I tried not to lose a word of Mr. Miles's idyl as the despair of the veteran was 
thundered into my other ear. I lent an ear to each conversationalist. Mary can not altogether control her voice, and 
her shrill screams of negation, "No, no, never," etc., utterly failed to suppress her wounded lover's obstreperous 
asseverations of his undying affection for her. 
</p><p>
Buck said afterward : We heard every word of it on our side of the room, even when Mamie shrieked to him that 
he was talking too loud. Now, Mamie, said we afterward, " do you think it was kind to tell him he was forty if he was a day? " 
</p><p>
Strange to say, the pet general, Edward, rehabilitated his love in a day; at least two days after he was heard to 
say that he was " paying attentions now to his cousin, John Preston's second daughter ; her name, Sally, but they 
called her Buck Sally Buchanan Campbell Preston, a lovely girl" And with her he now drove, rode, and hobbled on his crutches, sent her his photograph, and in due time cannonaded her, from the same spot where he had courted Mary, with proposals to marry him. 
</p><p>
Buck was never so decided in her " Nos " as Mary. (" Not so loud, at least " thus in amendment, says Buck, 
who always reads what I have written, and makes comments of assent or dissent.) So again he began to thunder in 
a woman's ears his tender passion. As they rode down Franklin Street, Buck says she knows the people on the 
sidewalk heard snatches of the conversation, though she rode as rapidly as she could, and she begged him not to talk 
so loud. Finally, they dashed up to our door as if they 
had been running a race. Unfortunate in love, but fortunate in war, our general is now winning new laurels with 
Ewell in the Valley or with the Army of the Potomac. 
</p><p>
I think I have told how Miles, still " so gently o er me leaning," told of his successful love while General Edward Johnston roared unto anguish and disappointment 
over his failures. Mr. Miles spoke of sweet little Bettie Bierne as if she had been a French girl, just from a convent, kept far from the haunts of men wholly for him. One would think to hear him that Bettie had never cast 
those innocent blue eyes of hers on a man until he came along. 
</p><p>
Now, since I first knew Miss Bierne in 1857, when Pat Calhoun was to the fore, she has been followed by a tale of 
men as long as a Highland chief's. Every summer at the Springs, their father appeared in the ballroom a little 
before twelve and chased the three beautiful Biernes home before him in spite of all entreaties, and he was said 
to frown away their too numerous admirers at all hours of 
the day. 
</p><p>
This new engagement was confided to me as a profound secret. Of course, I did not mention it, even to my own 
household. Next day little Alston, Morgan's adjutant, and George Deas called. As Colonel Deas removed his gloves, 
he said: "Oh! the Miles and Bierne sensation have you heard of it? " "No, what is the row about? " " They 
are engaged to be married; that's all." " Who told you? " " Miles himself, as we walked down Franklin 
Street, this afternoon." " And did he not beg you not to mention it, as Bettie did not wish it spoken of ? " " God 
bless my soul, so he did. And I forgot that part entirely." 
</p><p>
Colonel Alston begged the stout Carolinian not to take his inadvertent breach of faith too much to heart. Miss 
Bettie's engagement had caused him a dreadful night. A young man, who was his intimate friend, came to his room 
in the depths of despair and handed him a letter from Miss Bierne, which was the cause of all his woe. Not knowing 
that she was already betrothed to Miles, he had proposed to her in an eloquent letter. In her reply, she positively 
stated that she was engaged to Mr. Miles, and instead of thanking her for putting him at once out of his misery, he 
considered the reason she gave as trebly aggravating the agony of the love-letter and the refusal. Too late ! " he 
yelled, "by Jingo !" So much for a secret. 
</p><p>
Miss Bierne and I became fast friends. Our friendship 
was based on a mutual admiration for the honorable member from South Carolina. Colonel and Mrs. Myers and 
Colonel and Mrs. Chesnut were the only friends of Mr. Miles who were invited to the wedding. At the church 
door the sexton demanded our credentials. No one but those whose names he held in his hand were allowed to enter. Not twenty people were present a mere handful grouped about the altar in that large church. 
</p><p>
We were among the first to arrive. Then came a faint nutter and Mrs. Parkman (the bride's sister, swathed in 
weeds for her young husband, who had been killed within a year of her marriage) came rapidly up the aisle alone. She 
dropped upon her knees in the front pew, and there remained, motionless, during the whole ceremony, a mass of 
black crape, and a dead weight on my heart. She has had experience of war. A cannonade around Richmond interrupted her marriage service a sinister omen and in a year thereafter her bridegroom was stiff and stark dead upon the field of battle. 
</p><p>
While the wedding-march turned our thoughts from her and thrilled us with sympathy, the bride advanced in white 
satin and point d Alencon. Mrs. Myers whispered that it was Mrs. Parkman's wedding-dress that the bride had on. 
She remembered the exquisite lace, and she shuddered with superstitious forebodings. 
</p><p>
All had been going on delightfully in-doors, but a sharp shower cleared the church porch of the curious ; and, as the 
water splashed, we wondered how we were to assemble ourselves at Mrs. McFarland's. All the horses in Richmond 
had been impressed for some sudden cavalry necessity a 
few days before. I ran between Mr. McFarland and Senator Semmes with my pretty Paris rose-colored silk turned 
over my head to save it, and when we arrived at the hospitable mansion of the McFarlands, Mr. McFarland took me 
straight into the drawing-room, man-like, forgetting that my ruffled plumes needed a good smoothing and preening. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=mnc' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Lee</a> sent for me. She was staying at Mrs. Caskie's. I was taken directly to her room, where she was lying on the 
bed. She said, before I had taken my seat: " You know there is a fight going on now at Brandy Station " x " Yes, 
we are anxious. John Chesnut's company is there, too." She spoke sadly, but quietly. " My son, Roony, is wounded; his brother has gone for him. They will soon be here and we shall know all about it unless Roony's wife takes 
him to her grandfather. Poor lame mother, I am useless to my children." Mrs. Caskie said: " You need not be 
alarmed. The General said in his telegram that it was not a severe wound. You know even Yankees believe <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>General Lee</a>." 
</p><p>
That day, <a href='/results.php?tla=mnc' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Lee</a> gave me a likeness of the General in a photograph taken soon after the Mexican War. She likes 
it so much better than the later ones. He certainly was a handsome man then, handsomer even than now. I shall 
prize it for <a href='/results.php?tla=mnc' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Lee's</a> sake, too. She said old Mrs. Chesnut 
and her aunt, Nellie Custis (Mrs. Lewis) were very intimate during Washington's Administration in Philadelphia. 
I told her Mrs. Chesnut, senior, was the historical member of our family; she had so much to tell of Revolutionary 
times. She was one of the " white-robed choir " of little 
maidens who scattered flowers before Washington at Trenton Bridge, which everybody who writes a life of Washington asks her to give an account of. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Ould and <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> came home with me. Lawrence had a basket of delicious cherries. " If there were 
only some ice," said I. Respectfully Lawrence answered, and also firmly : l Give me money and you shall have ice. 
By the underground telegraph he had heard of an ice-house over the river, though its fame was suppressed by certain 
Sybarites, as they wanted it all. In a wonderfully short time we had mint-juleps and sherry-cobblers. 
</p><p>
Altogether it has been a pleasant day, and as I sat alone I was laughing lightly now and then at the memory of 
some funny story. Suddenly, a violent ring ; and a regular sheaf of telegrams were handed me. I could not have 
drawn away in more consternation if the sheets had been a nest of rattlesnakes. First, Frank Hampton was killed at 
Brandy Station. Wade Hampton telegraphed Mr. Chesnut to. see Robert Barnwell, and make the necessary arrangements to recover the body. Mr. Chesnut is still at Wilmington. I sent for Preston Johnston, and my neighbor, Colonel Patton, offered to see that everything proper was done. 
That afternoon I walked out alone. Willie Mountford had shown me where the body, all that was left of Frank Hampton, was to be laid in the Capitol. Mrs. Petticola joined me after a while, and then Mrs. Singleton. 
</p><p>
Preston Hampton and Peter Trezevant, with myself and Mrs. Singleton, formed the sad procession which followed 
the coffin. There was a company of soldiers drawn up in front of the State House porch. Mrs. Singleton said we had 
better go in and look at him before the coffin was finally closed. How I wish I had not looked. I remember him so 
well in all the pride of his magnificent manhood. He died 
of a saber-cut across the face and head, and was utterly disfigured. Mrs. Singleton seemed convulsed with grief. In 
all my life I had never seen such bitter weeping. She had her own troubles, but I did not know of them. We sat for 
a long time on the great steps of the State House. Every body had gone and we were alone. 
</p><p>
We talked of it all how we had gone to Charleston to see Rachel in Adrienne Lecouvreur, and how, as I stood 
waiting in the passage near the drawing-room, I had met Frank Hampton bringing his beautiful bride from the 
steamer. They had just landed. Afterward at Mrs. Singleton's place in the country we had all spent a delightful 
week together. And now, only a few years have passed, but nearly all that pleasant company are dead, and our 
world, the only world we cared for, literally kicked to pieces. And she cried, " We are two lone women, stranded 
here." Rev. Robert Barnwell was in a desperate condition, and Mary Barnwell, her daughter, was expecting her confinement every day. 
</p><p>
Here now, later, let me add that it was not until I got back to Carolina that I heard of Robert Barnwell's death, 
with scarcely a day's interval between it and that of Mary 
and her new-born baby. Husband, wife, and child were buried at the same time in the same grave in Columbia. 
And now, Mrs. Singleton has three orphan grandchildren. What a woful year it has been to her. 
</p><p>
Robert Barnwell had insisted upon being sent to the hospital at Staunton. On account of his wife's situation the 
doctor also had advised it. He was carried off on a mattress. 
His brave wife tried to prevent it, and said : " It is only fever." And she nursed him to the last. She tried to say goodby cheerfully, and called after him : " As soon as my trouble is over I will come to you at Staunton." At the hospital 
they said it was typhoid fever. He died the second day after he got there. Poor Mary fainted when she heard the 
ambulance drive away with him. Then she crept into a low trundle-bed kept for the children in her mother's room. 
</p><p>
She never left that bed again. When the message came from Staunton that fever was the matter with Robert and 
nothing more, Mrs. Singleton says she will never forget the expression in Mary's eyes as she turned and looked at her. 
" Robert will get well," she said, " it is all right." Her face was radiant, blazing with light. That night the baby 
was born, and Mrs. Singleton got a telegram that Robert was dead. She did not tell Mary, standing, as she did, at 
the window while she read it. She was at the same time 
looking for Robert's body, which might come any moment. As for Mary's life being in danger, she had never 
thought of such a thing. She was thinking only of Robert. 
Then a servant touched her and said : "Look at Mrs. Barnwell". She ran to the bedside, and the doctor, who had come 
in, said, " It is all over ; she is dead. Not in anger, not in 
wrath, came the angel of death that day. He came to set 
Mary free from a world grown too hard to bear.

During Stoneman's raid I burned some personal papers. Molly constantly said to me, " Missis, listen to de 
guns. Burn up everything. Mrs. Lyons says they are sure to come, and they ll put in their newspapers whatever you 
write here, every day. The guns did sound very near, and when <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> rode up and told me that if <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis</a> 
left Richmond I must go with her, I confess I lost my head. So I burned a part of my journal but rewrote it afterward 
from memory my implacable enemy that lets me forget none of the things I would. I am weak with dates. I do 
not always worry to look at the calendar and write them down. Besides I have not always a calendar at hand.
