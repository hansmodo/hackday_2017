Friday we washed out five dollars, then worked in a small hole that required the pump to be kept going steadily. We worked in the water most of the time over our boot tops, throwing out a heap of sand and clay to wash later. When I returned from work I had to change my clothes, being wet nearly all over. All day Saturday we worked hard in mud and water, and in the evening divided our pile of dust. I had as reward for five days' hard labor, $2.90. We hoped the work in this hole would turn out better. I believe it was Shakespeare who said,
<p></p>
"Hope told a flattering tale." We heard of four men taking out a ten pound lump at Agua Frio, and another party three pounds at the same place.

Sunday morning I baked a loaf of bread, washed my clothes, and read a copy of the New York Sun, dated March 15, which I borrowed from Mr. Cox. A political meeting was held in the forenoon to nominate candidates for constable and alcalde, the election taking place on Monday. In the afternoon I attended meeting in the forest and listened to a good sermon. Six ladies and about fifty gentlemen were in attendance.

Two more days of toil and labor are now over and I am scarcely a penny richer than when I commenced work yesterday morning, having realized only seventy-five cents. I have now worked, faithfully, in mud and water, knee deep part of the time, and have taken out as my share the astonishing sum of $3.65. I am convinced that we cannot get a worse place for digging than this is and would therefore be willing to leave for almost any place. I do not believe these mines can be worked to any advantage until the middle of August or later. Almost everybody has left and I have full faith in their wisdom as regards this particular case. I have made arrangements to leave with Mr. Cox, who will go with a friend, Mr. Hilliard, in the morning, for Tuolumne Diggings, some 60 or 70 miles from this place the way we have to go.

We sold 32 pounds of flour to lighten the weight we had, at 20 cents per pound, and with this we have but about ten dollars, besides owing a note of fifty-six dollars for provisions, and Atkins' doctor bill of some thirty dollars. Thus, one can see that things are going the wrong way, for we leave with a poorer hand than we came in with. My doctor bill for five days'
medicine was $17.50. This I cancelled by trading the doctor my long gum boots. Mr. Cox is a perfect gentleman and one of the kindest men I ever knew. I told him we had no money and could not pay him for hauling our trappings, and although he was heavily loaded, he told us that mattered nothing, we should only come and go with him, and we have concluded to accept the offer inasmuch as we cannot get away until we make a raise which is unlikely to happen soon here.

About four weeks since, this valley was crowded with gold seekers and every foot of ground on the creek was taken up for three miles, and lots were selling at from an ounce to $200; but now how changed the scene! The valley is nearly deserted and hundreds of claims are abandoned after many days' labor upon them, mine among the rest. Storekeepers are selling out and the place will soon be forsaken until fall, when the river bed can be worked. The theatre has closed and in lieu thereof a bull fight takes place on Sunday next.

We heard of another murder which took place near or at Merced Diggings. The man, named John Edwards, charged with the murder, is now in custody here and will be tried in June by the court of the county. The evidence against him is very slight. The murdered man was a Chinese.
