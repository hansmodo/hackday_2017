The House of Delegates have done little since my last, and 
what was then done is still ineffectual for want of a Senate. 
A proposition for stopping the receipt of indents was made, 
and met with so little countenance that it was withdrawn. 
They will continue to be receivable as far as the law now permits, and those who have them not would do well to provide 
them. A bill is depending which makes Tobacco receivable in 
lieu of the specie part of the current tax, according to its value 
at the different Warehouses. Whether it will pass or not is 
uncertain. I think it most probable that it will pass. Nothing 
has yet been done as to the certificate tax.
