Dear J.P.

Believe it or not this is a Christmas note from the Kings to you - maybe it had better be a New Year's Wish on the other hand.

We were so glad to get a card from you and then this war broke loose and your card didn't get off in time.  Hope this reaches you ok though and finds you well.

When did you enlist or were you called?  Dot said as soon as this war broke loose Zack said he be you were back in the Navy.  Have often wondered about you but no one knew where you were or anything.  Guess I saw you last.

Lois and her husband are in Washington D.C.  He has been in the Navy for 2 1/2 years now and she has done quite a bit of gadding around.  Was home twice last year but he is stationed on the east coast.  Wouldn't be surprised it she were home again though - he will probably be given sea duty for he has only had a few months of it.

I'm now a beauty operator and working for the present in Mt. View.

Bernice Hornbeck was married the last of October to an army private.  She is teaching in Salinas.  Myra had been married for almost two years and lives in San Jose.  She and her husband are rather radical you know Myra.  Vera has a very nice little husband and is now in Palo Alto.  They have had quite a bit of hard luck but are getting along fine now.

Mr. Eaton finally died this fall after being sick for a year.  It went very hard on Mrs. Lind and I felt so sorry for her.
Mother is still teaching- she says she dislikes it but gets pretty sick of staying home during vacation.  Horace is building a house across the street very much like our house uptown which burned.

Hope this finds you well and the very best of wishes for the New Year from the Kings and Ruth Theller

P.S.  Hope this doesn't sound too stiff and if there are any gaps you would like to have filled in write and I'll answer them to the best of my ability - Write anyway and let us know how you are, Your friend, Ruth.
