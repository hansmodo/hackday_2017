<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city origin'>CHARLESTON</a>, S. C., <a rel='month origin' value='5'>May</a> <a rel='day origin' value='25'>25</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city origin'>CHARLESTON</a>, S. C.]. We have come 
back to South Carolina from the Montgomery Congress, stopping over at Mulberry. We came with 
<a href='/results.php?tla=rmh' rel='acquaintance met'>R. M. T. Hunter</a> and Mr. Barnwell. Mr. Barnwell has excellent reasons for keeping cotton at home, but I forget 
what they are. Generally, people take what he says, also 
<a href='/results.php?tla=rmh' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Hunter's</a> wisdom, as unanswerable. Not so Mr. Chesnut, who growls at both, much as he likes them. We also 
had Tom Lang and his wife, and Doctor Boykin. Surely there never was a more congenial party. The younger men 
had been in the South Carolina College while Mr. Barnwell 
was President. Their love and respect for him were immeasurable and he benignly received it, smiling behind 
those spectacles.

Met John Darby at Atlanta and told him he was Surgeon of the Hampton Legion, which delighted him. He 
had had adventures. With only a few moments on the platform to interchange confidences, he said he had remained a little too long in the Medical College in Philadelphia, where he was some kind of a professor, and they had 
been within an ace of hanging him as a Southern spy. " Rope was ready," he sniggered. At Atlanta when he 
unguardedly said he was fresh from Philadelphia, he barely escaped lynching, being taken for a Northern spy. Lively 
life I am having among you, on both sides, he said, hurrying away. And I moaned, " Here was John Darby like to have been killed by both sides, and no time to tell me 
the curious coincidences." What marvelous experiences a little war begins to produce.
