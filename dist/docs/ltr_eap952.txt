My Own Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>:--It was delightful to me to read over and over again your very interesting letter. I had to laugh when I read your dream, and I thought how much more I would enjoy the reality. I have had some amusing dreams myself but I would not like to put them down on paper.

You speak of the effect the reception or non-reception of a letter has on a Californian. When I am expecting a letter and do not receive one, I feel disappointed, and how much worse must you feel when you are disappointed in a strange land, and among strangers. I hear that some men fly to intoxicating drink to enable them to bear their disappointments. What a distressing thing it is!
</p><p>
I hope you may sell out to advantage. You have been more ambitious than any person I ever knew and I am sure industry will be rewarded.

Mrs. Dixon continues as gay as a butterfly.

There is a panorama of a whaling voyage round the world here at present. I went to see it on Monday evening. I saw Cape Horn. While I was sitting in the Hall I called to mind the last panorama you and I went together to see.

Your younger brother is in Samuel Evans' store. I have seen him several times, but I do not see that he looks a great deal like you. I only wish he did look more like you.
</p><p>
Nothing more at present. A speedy return is the prayer of her that loves you.
