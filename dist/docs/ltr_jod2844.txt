MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
OUR worthy friend, Frank Dana, arrived here last evening from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, to which place he came lately 
from England in the packet. In company with him 
is a gentleman by the name of Wrixon, who has been 
a field officer in the British army, served all the last 
war in Germany, and has seen service in every part 
of Europe. He left the army some time ago, and 
studied law in the temple, in which science he made 
a great proficiency. He wrote, lately, a pamphlet under the title of " the Rights of Britons," which he has 
brought over with him. He is a friend of liberty, and 
thinks justly of the American question. He has great 
abilities, as well as experience in the military science, 
and is an able engineer. I hope we shall employ 
him. 
The Baron de Woedtke we have made a Brigadier 
General, and ordered him to Canada. The testimonials in his favor I shall enclose to you. Mr. Dana's t 
account, with which Mr. Wrixon's agrees, ought to extinguish, in every mind, all hopes of reconciliation 
with Great Britain. This delusive hope has done us great injuries, and if ever we are ruined, will be the 
cause of our fall. A hankering after the leeks of Egypt makes us forget the cruelty of her task masters. 
</p><p>
I shall suffer many severe pains on your account 
for some days. By a vessel from Salem a cannonade was heard from dark till nine o clock, last night 
was a week ago. Your vicinity to such scenes of 
carnage and desolation as, I fear, are now to be seen 
in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> and its environs, will throw you into much 
distress, but I believe in my conscience, I feel more 
here than you do. The sound of cannon was not 
so terrible, when I was at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>, as it is here, 
though I hear it at four hundred miles distance. 
</p><p>
You can't imagine what a mortification I sustain in 
not having received a single line from you since we 
parted. I suspect some villany in conveyance. By the 
relation of Mr. Dana, Mr. Wrixon and Mr. Temple, 
Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Sewall and their associates are in 
great disgrace in England. Persons are ashamed to 
be seen to speak to them. They look despised and sunk. 
</p><p>
I shall enclose an extract of a letter from Mons. Dubourg in Paris, and a testimonial in favor of our Prussian General 
</p><p>
Adieu.
