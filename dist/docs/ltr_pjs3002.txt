DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Since my last I have been most assiduously employed in preparing materials for building boats to convey me across the Lake. The progress has hitherto been slow, 
as with few hands I had all the timber to cut, mills to repair, to saw the plank, and my draught-cattle extremely weak for want of feed, the drought having 
scorched up every kind of herbage. I have now one boat on the stocks, which I hope will carry near three 
hundred men ; another is putting up to-day. Provisions of the bread kind are scarce with me, and therefore I have not dared to order up a thousand men 
that are at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, lest we should starve here. 
</p><p>
I have had no intelligence from Canada since my last to you. Major Brown has been gone nine days, and I expect him back, if all is well, by Saturday next 
</p><p>
2 August. 
</p><p>
I have not had a return from <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a></a> since my arrival. I am therefore under the necessity of making you a return of the troops here only. 
</p><p>
I inclose your Excellency copies of two affidavits 
made by persons from Canada. I have transmit 
ted other copies to the Congress. 
</p><p>
I am extremely anxious to hear from your part 
of the world. Reports prevail that a body of troops 
have left <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and are gone to Canada. If so, I 
fear we shall not be able to penetrate into Canada, 
or even attack St. John's with success, though at 
all events I am ordered to go there. I am 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient 
</p><p>
and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=pjs" rel="me">PHILIP SCHUYLER</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I wish I could make you a regular return 
even of the troops at this place and Crown Point, but I 
have not yet got these people to be regular in any 
thing, and therefore beg you to dispense with the 
following statement. 
</p><p>
Fit for duty, one colonel, three majors, nine captains, one captain-lieutenant, twenty-one subalterns, 
thirty-four sergeants, eighteen drums and fifes, ninety-three rank and file, one chaplain, two adjutants, 
one quarter-master, one surgeon, and two mates. 
Sick, one lieutenant, four sergeants, two drums, 
one hundred and three rank and file. 
</p>
