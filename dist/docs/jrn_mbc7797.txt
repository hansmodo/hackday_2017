<a rel='month origin' value='6'>June</a> <a rel='day origin' value='1'>1st</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=camden' rel='city origin'>CAMDEN</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. The New York Herald quotes <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>General Sherman</a> as saying, " Columbia was burned by Hampton's 
sheer stupidity. But then wh*o burned everything on the way in <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman's</a> march to Columbia, and in the line of 
march <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> took after leaving Columbia ? We came, for three days of travel, over a road that had been laid bare by 
<a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman's</a> torches. Nothing but smoking ruins was left in <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman's</a> track. That I saw with my own eyes. No living thing was left, no house for man or beast. They who burned the countryside for a belt of forty miles, did they 
not also burn the town? To charge that to " Hampton's stupidity " is merely an afterthought. This Herald announces that Jeff Davis will be hanged at once, not so much for treason as for his assassination of <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a>. " Stanton," the Herald says, " has all the papers in his hands to convict him."

The Yankees here say, "The black man must go as the red man has gone this is a white man's country." The negroes want to run with the hare, but hunt with the hounds. They are charming in their professions to us, but declare 
that they are to be paid by these blessed Yankees in lands and mules for having been slaves. They were so faithful 
to us during the war, why should the Yankees reward them, to which the only reply is that it would be by way of punishing rebels.

Mrs. Adger saw a Yankee soldier strike a woman, and she prayed God to take him in hand according to his deed. 
</p><p>
The soldier laughed in her face, swaggered off, stumbled down the steps, and then his revolver went off by the concussion and shot him dead.

The black ball is in motion. Mrs. de Saussure's cook shook the dust off her feet and departed from her kitchen 
to-day free, she said. The washerwoman is packing to go.

Scipio Africanus, the Colonel's body-servant, is a soldierly looking black creature, fit to have delighted the eyes 
of old Frederick William of Prussia, who liked giants. We asked him how the Yankees came to leave him. " Oh, I 
told them marster couldn't do without me nohow ; and then I carried them some nice hams that they never could have 
found, they were hid so good.

Eben dressed himself in his best and went at a run to meet his Yankee deliverers so he said. At the gate he met 
a squad coming in. He had adorned himself with his watch and chain, like the cordage of a ship, with a handful of 
gaudy seals. He knew the Yankees came to rob white people, but he thought they came to save niggers. Hand over 
that watch! " they said. Minus his fine watch and chain, Eben returned a sadder and a wiser man. He was soon in 
his shirt-sleeves, whistling at his knife-board. " Why? You here? AVhy did you come back so soon? " he was 
asked. ; Well, I thought may be I better stay with ole marster that give me the watch, and not go with them that 
stole it." The watch was the pride of his life. The iron had entered his soul.

Went up to my old house, " Kamschatka." The Trapiers live there^now. In those drawing-rooms where the 
children played Puss in Boots, where we have so often danced and sung, but never prayed before, Mr. Trapier 
held his prayer-meeting. I do not think I ever did as much weeping or as bitter in the same space of time. I let my 
self go; it did me good. I cried with a will. He prayed 
that we might have strength to stand up and bear our bitter disappointment, to look on our ruined homes and our deso 
lated country and be strong. And he prayed for the man " we elected to be our ruler and guide." We knew that 
they had put him in a dungeon and in chains. Men watch him day and night. By orders of Andy, the bloody-minded 
tailor, nobody above the rank of colonel can take the benefit 
of the amnesty oath, nobody who owns over twenty thousand dollars, or who has assisted the Confederates. And 
now, ye rich men, howl, for your misery has come upon you. 
You are beyond the outlaw, camping outside. Howell Cobb and <a href='/results.php?tla=rmh' rel='acquaintance met'>R. M. T. Hunter</a> have been arrested. Our turn will 
come next, maybe. A Damocles sword hanging over a house does not conduce to a pleasant life.
