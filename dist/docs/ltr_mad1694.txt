DEAR SIR - * * * * * * 
</p><p>
The Bank shares have risen as much in the Market here as 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. It seems admitted on all hands now that the 
plan of the institution gives a moral certainty of gain to the 
subscribers, with scarce a physical possibility of loss. The subscriptions are consequently a mere scramble for so much public 
plunder, which will be engrossed by those already loaded with 
the spoils of individuals. The event shews what would have 
been the operation of the plan, if, as originally proposed, subscriptions had been limited to the 1st of April, and to the favorite 
species of stock which the Bank Jobbers had monopolized. It 
pretty clearly appears, also, in what proportions the public debt 
lies in the Country, what sort of hands hold it, and by whom 
the people of the United States are to be governed. Of all the 
shameful circumstances of this business, it is among the greatest 
to see the members of the Legislature who were most active in 
pushing this job openly grasping its emoluments. Schuyler is 
to be put at the head of the Directors, if the weight of the New 
York subscribers can effect it. Nothing new is talked of here. 
In fact, stock-jobbing drowns every other subject. The CoffeeHouse is in an eternal buzz with the Gamblers.
