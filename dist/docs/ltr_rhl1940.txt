23, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1774">1774</a>, 
</p><p>
SIR I did myself the pleasure of writing to you, from this place, before my departure for our Assembly, in May last, and again, from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>. immediately after 
our dissolution, enclosing the order for a fast, which produced that event; and an account of the subsequent 
conduct of the members, after the political death inflicted on them. The day before we were dissolved, I had prepared a set of resolutions, the two last of which, were thus expressed: 
</p><p>
" Resolved, That the blocking up, or attempting to block up the harbour of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, until the people there shall submit to the payment of the taxes imposed upon 
them, without the consent of their representatives, is a most violent and dangerous attempt to destroy the constitutional liberty and rights of all British America." 
</p><p>
" Resolved, That ................ be appointed deputies from this House, to meet at ....... such deputies from the other colonies as they shall appoint, 
there to consider and determine on ways the most effectual to stop the exports from North America, and for the adoption of such other measures, as may be most 
decisive, for securing the rights of America against the systematic plan formed for their destruction." 
</p><p>
I have not a remaining doubt that these resolutions would have been agreed to, had they been proposed. I was prevented from offering them, by many 
worthy members, who wished to have the public business first finished, and who were induced to believe, from many conversations they had heard, that there was no 
danger of a dissolution, before it had happened. It seems government were alarmed at the spirit which the order 
for a fast denoted, and fearing the consequences, interposed a dissolution. The consequent conduct of the members, was surely much too feeble, in opposition to 
that very dangerous and alarming degree, to which despotism had advanced. So thinking, I did propose to the dissolved members, the plan of a general Congress; 
but they made a distinction, between their then state, and that, when they were members of the House of Burgesses. Most of the members, and myself among 
the rest, had left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, before your message from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> had arrived. Twenty-five of them, however, were assembled to consider of that message, and 
they determined to invite a general meeting of the whole body, on the first of August, to consider the measure of stopping the exports and imports. Since that, an Indian 
invasion of our frontier, has compelled the calling a new Assembly, for which purpose, writs, returnable to the eleventh August, are now out, at which time, it is thought 
the House will meet; when, I think, there is no manner of doubt, they will directly adopt the most effectual 
means in their power, for obtaining a redress of grievances. In the mean time, the sense of some counties is taking, and two have already declared their desire to stop 
the commercial intercourse between Great Britain and the West Indies, and this colony. It seems very clear to me, that there will be a general agreement. Do you not 
think, that the first most essential step for our Assembly to take, will be an invitation to a general Congress, as speedily as the nature of things will admit, in order that 
our plan, whatever it may be, may be unanimous, and therefore effectual. I shall be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> the first of August, and shall continue there until the meeting 
of Assembly on the eleventh. It will be exceedingly agreeable to me, to know your sentiments fully, on this most important subject. I am sure it will be of real 
consequence to the cause of liberty, that your committee of correspondence write fully your sentiments to ours, at the same time. It will be well, so to time the matter, 
as that your letters may be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> before the first of August, at which time, a meeting of the late representatives will take place, notwithstanding the 
return of the writs to the eleventh instant. I hope the good people of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> will not loose their spirits under their present heavy oppression, for they 
will certainly be supported by the other colonies; and the cause for which they suffer, is so glorious, and so deeply interesting to the present, and future generations, 
that all America will owe, in a great measure, their political salvation to the present virtue of Massachusetts Bay. I am, sir, with very singular regard, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, 
</p><p>
and humble servant, 
</p><p>
