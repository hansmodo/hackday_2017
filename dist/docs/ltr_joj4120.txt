Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
We have both heard it asserted that a man's character 
may be discerned from his handwriting ; if that be true, 
you and our friend, <a href='/results.php?tla=ewr' rel='colleague met friend'>Edward Rutledge</a>, must be as enigmatical and unintelligible as Oliver Cromwell, and yet 
neither of you resemble him more than he did an honest man. 
</p><p>
The kindness diffused through your letter of the 19th of 
June paid me for the trouble of deciphering it. Two or 
three words, however, proved too hard for me. To judge 
from the context, I presume they mean something good 
and friendly, and therefore that I have reason to be pleased 
with the ideas intended to be conveyed by them, although 
I do not know precisely what they are.

Peace, my dear sir, was formerly thought a good sort of 
thing ; but within these few years past it seems to have been 
going fast out of fashion. But, to be serious, there seems 
to be something more than common at work in, or on the 
human mind, and urging it to enterprise, tending to introduce a new state of things. Symptoms of it appear more 
or less, and in differenl degrees, in all parts of Europe â€” 
even in Spain, where quiescency in every sense has long 
been cherished. Geneva is at this moment undergoing 
another revolution; where next, no one can tell. Our 
country may catch the flame. We live in an eventful 
season. We have nothing to do but our duty, and one 
part of it is to prepare for every event. Let us preserve 
peace while it can be done with propriety; and if in that we 
fail, let us wage war, not in newspapers and impotent sarcasms, but with manly firmness, and unanimous and vigorous efforts.

I have had the pleasure of seeing your brother frequently, 
and am pleased with him. He is gone to Scotland. He 
has communicated to me a circumstance that I rejoice in. 
</p><p>
Assure Mrs. Read of my best wishes. With real esteem 
and regard, I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
Joix?; Jay.
