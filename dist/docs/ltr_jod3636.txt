MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I DINED yesterday with Dr. Rush, who desired me to send the enclosed oration upon a weak democrat 
whom he is pleased to call a great philosopher, astronomer and republican. We must put up with the vagaries of our flighty friend. Mr. and Mrs. Listen, the 
Britons, dined there, the first time I had met the lady. 
They are Scotch, genteel people. Mr. and Mrs. Regal dined there too. Mr. Regal brought a letter, you 
remember, from <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='me'>Mr. Adams</a>. A man of sixty, perhaps, married to a handsome girl of thirty. A man 
of learning, but I presume enthusiastical. He talks 
much of the philosophy of Mr. Kant or Kent, or some 
such name, a German of great fame. He speaks of 
him sometimes very extravagantly. I heard him say that he thought Kant would make a third from Socrates and Jesus Christ. 
</p><p>
Mankind seem to me to have lost their senses. 
</p><p>
I yesterday received yours of the 25th of December. The cold has been as constant and severe as with 
you. I hope you will get wood enough, yet it is uncertain how much will be necessary. Stones cannot 
be sledded in too great numbers. They will not be 
stolen. Have you seen the second " Guillotina" from 
Connecticut, in its usual strain of wicked satire ? 
</p><p>
Neither Virginia nor any other State, except the 
wise Pennsylvania and the wise Georgia, Tennessee, 
and Kentucky, ever intended B. should be Vice. I 
have received one set of votes from each State, and 
the highest number is seventy-one, according to the 
accounts. The votes are all sealed up. 
</p><p>
I say, too, " If thou, O Lord ! go not up with us, 
carry us not up thither."
