Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
By Capt. Barney I was favoured with yours of the 31st 
May. By this time T hope you will have received several 
letters from me, which were then on the way. Want of 
health has long made much writing painful to me, so that 
my letters in general are short.

My jaunt to Normandy did me some service, but less 
than I expected. The pare air of this place has been useful to me. The pain in my breast has abated, and I have 
had no fever since 1 came here, which was about six weeks ago. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=gom' rel='colleague friend met'>Gouverneur</a> is happy in your esteem; it adds to mine 
for him. I have Ions been attached to him, and sincerely 
wish that our friendship, instead of being diminished, may 
continue to erain strength with time. 
</p><p>
Your intended resignation alarmed me, and would have 
been followed with ill consequences to our affairs. I rejoice 
that you continue in office, and by no means regret that it 
will be less in your power than inclination to retire soon. 
I am well aware of the difficulties you will continue to experience. Everyman so circumstanced must expect them. 
Your office is neither an easy nor a pleasant one to execute, 
but it is elevated and important, and therefore envy, with 
her inseparable companion injustice, will not cease to plague 
you. Remember, however, that triumphs do not precede 
victory, and that victory is seldom found in the smooth 
paths of peace and tranquillity. Your enemies would be 
happy to drive you to resign, and in my opinion both your 
interest and that of your country oppose your gratifying 
them. You have health, fortune, talents, and fortitude, and 
you have children too. Each of these circumstances recommend perseverance.

As to money this court will afford you no further supplies. The minister has said, it was easy to be a financier 
and draw bills, when others provided the funds to pay them, 
At another time, he intimated that his court was not treated 
with a proper degree of delicacy on thai subject, and said, 
"that you treated them as your cashiers." A French 
officer from America, who is a friend ofyours, told me that 
La Luzerne and Marbois were not pleased with the manner of your applications to them about money matters. I 
mention these facts, because it may be useful for you to 
know them. 
</p><p>
The loan in Holland goes on, and from that quarter your 
bills must lie saved, if at all. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Adams</a> sot out for Amsterdam the day before yesterday, and will push on that 
business. If the Dutch began to draw benefit from our 
trade, they would lend more cheerfully. 
</p><p>
The British ministry have not yet authorized Mr. Hartley 
to consent to any thing as to commerce. They amuse him 
and us, and deceive themselves. I told him yesterday that 
they would find us like a globe ; not to be overset. They 
wish to be the only carriers between their islands and other 
countries; and though they are apprized of our right to 
regulate our trade as we please, yet I suspect they flatter 
themselves that the different States possess too little of a 
national or continental spirit, ever to agree in any one 
national system. I think they will find themselves mistaken. 
</p><p>
Believe me to be, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend, 
</p><p>
