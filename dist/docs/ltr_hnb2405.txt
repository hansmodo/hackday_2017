<a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Col. Burr</a> set off to-day at 1 o'clock, P. M., in the mail, 
for <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, with S. Swartwout, as he had no particular desire to behold a representation of his execution. I was a little more curious ; and, notwithstanding hand 
bills were this morning scattered through the town, purporting that the execution of Judge Marshall, <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">A. Burr</a>, Luther Martin and myself would take place at Gallows Hill, at 3 o'clock this evening, I both dined and supped at 
the public table, with very large companies, here at Evans's, and am, after all, hearty and in good spirits. 
The mob was made up from the Point, but pledged their honor, which they did not violate, that they would hurt 
no person. They were followed by two troops of horse through the streets, to see they did their business orderly. 
All have dispersed at least three hours ago, it being now 11, P. M.

I start to-morrow for <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, where I am sure I shall not receive such public honors. I tire you with too many letters ; but it is to prevent your paying any attention to the newspapers. I expect Doctor Commins and myself will travel together to <a href="/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>. I pray God this may find you and the boys well. This is the only care that occupies
