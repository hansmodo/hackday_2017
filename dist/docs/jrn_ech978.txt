We crossed the Equator Friday, August 31st, in longitude 23 deg. W. In the evening, pursuant to custom, old Neptune and his assistants made their appearance, dressed in the most grotesque style, and every one on board had to stand treat or be "shaved." The shaving consists in having tar and oil rubbed over your face and scraped off with an old knife or file, not a very pleasant operation, by the way. Much sport was had on this occasion, but I missed it, as well as the "shaving," on account of severe illnessconfined to my berth. I have been sick with the fever which rendered my situation very bad. I have just been on deck, the first time for days. Since my recovery from the fever, my head is getting better and I hope to be
"a good egg" in a day or two, in fact, heartier than I ever was before. Clint and I have been troubled near two months with the seasickness, and it is very disagreeable but said to be highly conducive to health as it cleanses the stomach of all bilious matter.

Friday we made 208 miles, the best run we have made. I saw a large turtle this morning. A few of Mother Carey's chickens have been following in our wake since crossing the line but have now left us. A fair wind is blowing but the weather is rather fickle; we have had alternate sunshine and showersthree rainbows, one in the morning and two towards evening.

Dick, Mack, Tilghman & Co. had a frolic aloft and, after emptying the bottles, threw them on deck, which came near creating a serious disturbance. Also a duel was nearly had between Dick and the doctor. Rick, vez! The violin had been brought forward and several reels were gone through with. I took a lunch on cold pork, catsup and navy bread and made a first-rate drink of water, ginger and molasses mixed together.

There is nothing to be seen from one end to the other but a dreary waste of blue sky above and rolling water below. Yet this is what has so often been pictured as something beautiful to look upon, and entertaining to be tossed about upon. But notwithstanding all that has been said of its charms, its novelty is now over and it hath no charms any longer for me. It is nearly ten weeks since we left port. Truly a long while to see nothing but sky and water and our own good ship, and yet it will be a long while again before we reach port. I am tired of it and wish to be on shore, and there are others who are as anxious in this respect as myself. "But there's a good time coming, boys." We'll push
dull melancholy by and look on the bright side of the picture.

During the past two weeks, in lieu of fresh-baked bread twice a week we have been receiving buckwheat cakes and corn bread every alternate morning. The cakes, to be sure, are not nice, light, round cakes, but large, square ones an inch thick, and baked in a pan of fat instead of on a bake plate, yet we count it "high living" and devoutly pray that it may continue during the remainder of the voyage, as one "good" meal a day is not to be sneezed at. It would do our friends good to witness the eagerness with which these "delicate" dishes are devoured. When breakfast time arrives a rush is made and the plates are soon emptied, and woe to the poor wight who happens to get behind, for he is sure to go without breakfast and unless it happens to be "duff day," Thursday or Sunday, he has but a poor relish for anything until the next breakfast is brought forward.

Our latitude is 18 deg. S. This morning we sounded for bottom to the depth of 70 fathoms but found none. We are now in the neighborhood of a bank or shoals called "Adois," I think, and about 200 miles from shore. I saw a dead duck floating along. We have stopped a leak in the head of the vessel.

After dinner, the brig Howland came within hailing distance. He told us that he was 45 days from Boston to Rio de Janeiro, also that he spoke the brig Virginia a few days since, 60 days from New Orleans to California. We told him we were from Philadelphia, 60 days outbound to California, gave him our longitude as he did hishis 36 deg. 12[min] W., our own 36 deg. 10[min] W.and requested him to report in the States, the ship " Europe all well," and then parted with six
round cheers for the Yankee captain. One of the men on their forecastle cheered with such great earnestness that we witnessed him spring into the air some three or four feet and come down, sprawling on his latter end! Our passage has thus far been very long and tedious and it was quite cheering to hear of even one vessel that was not distancing us.

I just saw one Mother Carey's chicken. They appear to be found almost everywhere in the ocean.
