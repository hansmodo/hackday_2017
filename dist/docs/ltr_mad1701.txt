DEAR SIR, I have delayed for some time writing, in the 
daily expectation that I should be able to resume the subject of 
the Representation bill, the progress and fate of which were 
mentioned in my last. A motion for reviving it in another 
form has been some days on the table, and is now the order 
of the day, but has been kept back partly by a general torpor 
resulting from the critical loss of the bill, and partly by the 
interference of other business. The motion alluded to proposes, as compensation for the present inequality of fractions, 
a repetition of the census in 4 or 5 years, which will have not 
only the effect of shortening the term of the fractions complained of, but of preventing the accumulation of much greater 
inequalities within a period of ten years. This expedient is 
relished generally by the Southern States, and by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> 
and Vermont, which are growing States. It will be equally 
unpalatable to Massachusetts, Connecticut, &c., which are very 
willing to take the benefit of the future operation of an apportionment for ten years, although they raise so great an outcry 
against the little fractional advantage accruing to other States 
from the ratio of 1 for 30,000.

The House of Representatives has been occupied for some 
days, with shut doors, on the communications of the President 
relating to the Western Frontiers. There is a pretty general 
disposition to make the protection effectual, but a great wrmt 
of unanimity as to the best means. It is probable that much 
will be left to the judgment of the President; and it is to be 
hoped that the lessons of past experience will not be without 
effect.

I have reserv. for you a copy of the Report of the Secretary 
of the Treasury on Manufactures, for which I hoped to have 
found before this a private conveyance, it being rather bulky 
for the mail. Having not yet succeeded in hitting on an opportunity, I send you a part of it in a newspaper, which broaches a 
new Constitutional doctrine of vast consequence, and demanding the serv.us attention of the public. I consider it myself as 
subverting the fundamental and characteristic principle of the 
Government; as contrary to the true and fair, as well as the 
received construction, and as bidding defiance to the sense in 
which the Constitution is known to have been proposed, advocated, and adopted. If Congress can do whatever in their discretion can be done by money, and will promote the General 
Welfare, the Government is no longer a limited one, possessing 
enumerated powers, but an indefinite one, subject to particular 
exceptions. It is to be remarked that the phrase out of which 
this doctrine is elaborated is copied from the old Articles of 
Confederation, where it was always understood as nothing 
more than a general caption to the specified powers, and it is a 
fact that it was preferred in the new instrument for that very 
reason, as less liable than any other to misconstruction. 
Remaining always most affectionately yours.
