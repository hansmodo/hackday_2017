SIR I have lately been favoured with three letters from you, and must beg you to attribute my omitting to 
make due acknowledgments till this time, to a multiplicity of affairs to which I am obliged to give my constant attention. The unrighteous and oppressive act of 
the British Parliament for shutting up this harbour, though executed with a rigour beyond the intent/ even 
of its framers, has hitherto failed, and will, I believe, continue to fail of the effect, which the enemies of America flattered themselves it would have. The inhabitants 
still wear cheerful countenances; far from being in the least intimidated, they are resolved to undergo the greatest hardships rather than submit in any instance to 
the tyrannical act. They are daily encouraged to persevere, by the intelligence they receive from their brethren, not of this province only, but every other 
colony, that they are considered as suffering in the common cause, and the resolution of all to support them in the conflict. Lord North had no expectation that 
we should be thus sustained ; on the contrary, he trusted that' <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> would be left to fall alone. He has therefore made no preparation for the effects of an union. 
From the information I have had from intelligent persons in England, I verily believe the design was to 
seize some persons and send them home ; but the steadiness and prudence of the people, and the unexpected 
union of the colonies, evidenced by liberal contributions for our support, has disconcerted them and they are at a loss to know how to proceed further. Four regiments 
are encamped on our common and more are expected; but I hope the people will by circumspect behaviour, prevent their taking occasion to act. The port bill is 
followed by two other acts, one for regulating the government of this province, or rather totally to destroy 
our free constitution, and substituting an absolute despotic one in its stead ; the other for the more impartial 
administration of justice, or as some term it for screening from punishment any soldier who shall murder an 
American, for asserting his rights. A submission to these acts will doubtles be required and expected ; but whether General Gage will find it an easy thing to force 
the people to submit to so great and fundamental a change of government, is a question I think worth his consideration. Will the people of America consider 
these measures as an attack on the constitution of an individual province, in which the rest are not interested, or will they view the model of government prepared for 
us as a system for the whole continent ? Will they as unconcerned spectators, look on it to be designed only to lop off the exuberant branches of democracy in the 
constitution of this province, or as part of a plan to reduce them all to slavery. These are questions, in my opinion, of great importance, which I trust will be 
thoroughly weighed in a general congress. May God inspire that intended body with wisdom and fortitude, and unite and prosper their councils. 
<p></p>
The people of this province are thoroughly sensible of the necessity of breaking off all commercial connection with a country, whose political councils tend 
only to enslave them. They, however, consider the body of the nation as kept in profound ignorance of 
the nature of the dispute between Britain and the colonies, and are taught to believe that we are a perfidious and rebellious people. It is with reluctance they come 
into any resolutions, which must distress those who are not the objects of their resentments, but they are urged 
to it by motives of self-preservation ; and are therefore signing an agreement in the several towns, not to consume any British manufactures, which shall be imported 
after the last of August next, and that they may not be imposed upon, they are to require an oath of those of whom they purchase goods. It is the virtue of the 
yeomanry we are chiefly to depend upon. Our friends in Maryland talk of withholding the exportation of tobacco ; this was hinted to us by the gentlemen of the 
late House of Burgesses of Virginia, who had been called together, after the dissolution of the Assembly. This would be a measure greatly interesting to the mother country. 
<p></p>
Should America hold up her own importance to the body of the nation, and at the same time agree to one general bill of rights, the dispute might be settled on 
principles of freedom, and harmony be restored between Great Britain and the colonies. 
<p></p>
I am, with great regard, 
<p></p>
your friend and servant, 
<p></p>
