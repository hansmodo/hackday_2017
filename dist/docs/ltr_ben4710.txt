SIR, 
</p><p>
I return you many thanks for the box of elephants' tusks 
and grinders. They are extremely curious on many accounts ; 
no living elephants having been seen in any part of America 
by any of the Europeans settled there, or remembered in any 
tradition of the Indians. It is also puzzling to conceive what 
should have brought so many of them to die on the same spot ; 
and that no such remains should be found in any other part 
of the continent, except in that very distant country, Peru, from whence some grinders of the same kind formerly brought, 
are now in the museum of the Royal Society. The tusks 
agree with those of the African and Asiatic elephant in being 
nearly of the same form and texture, and some of them, notwithstanding the length of time they must have lain, being 
still good ivory. But the grinders differ, being full of knobs, 
like the grinders of a carnivorous animal ; when those of the 
elephant, who eats only vegetables, are almost smooth. But 
then we know of no other animal with tusks like an elephant, 
to whom such grinders might belong. 
</p><p>
It is remarkable, that elephants now inhabit naturally 
only hot countries where there is no winter, and yet these 
remains are found in a winter country ; and it is no uncommon thing to find elephants' tusks in Siberia, in great quantities, when their rivers overflow, and wash away the earth, 
though Siberia is still more a wintry country than that on the 
Ohio; which looks as if the earth had anciently been in 
another position, and the climates differently placed from 
what they are at present. 
</p><p>
With great regard, I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
