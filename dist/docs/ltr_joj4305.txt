Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since my arrival here, I have written you two or 
three hasty letters. Being constantly involved in 
business or company, from which it would not he 
here very practicable, or perhaps prudent, to retreat, 
I have been able to write but very little. The Convention this moment adjourned, and I am writing in 
their chamber. A question being about to be put on 
the mode of adoption (which you have seen), we moved that the House adjourn for a month or two. It 
was yesterday carried against us. The former question w^as again pressed with earnestness. At that 
period Mr. M. Smith, seconded by Mr. Piatt (both of 
whom dislike the Constitution, and are classed with 
its opposers) proposed the mode of adoption, of which 
the above is a copy. Their own party were not 
pleased, and the House adjourned. 
</p><p>
This morning it was expected that the question to 
postpone the former plan, and proceed to the consideration of the latter, would be put. The House 
went into a Committee of the Whole, according to 
the order of the day. A long silence ensued. The 
party seemed embarrassed, fearful to divide among 
themselves, and yet many of them were averse to 
the new plan. The Committee rose, and the House 
adjourned, with very little opposition. It is difficult 
to conjecture what may he done out of doors to-day. 
I am inclined to think that the new plan will expel 
the other, and I wish it may ; not because I approve 
of it, hut because I prefer it, as being less exceptionable than the other. With the greatest respect and 
esteem, I am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate and humble servant, 
</p><p>
John Jay.
