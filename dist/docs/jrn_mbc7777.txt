<a href='/results.php?city=chester' rel='city origin'>CHESTER</a>, S. C., <a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='21'>21</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>. Another flitting has occurred. Captain Ogden came for me; the splendid Childs was true as steel to the last. Surely he is the kindest of men. Captain Ogden was slightly in 
credulous when I depicted the wonders of Colonel Childs's generosity. So I skilfully led out the good gentleman for 
inspection, and he walked to the train with us. He offered me Confederate money, silver, and gold ; and finally offered 
to buy our cotton and pay us now in gold. Of course, I laughed at his overflowing bounty, and accepted nothing; 
but I begged him to come down to Chester or Camden and buy our cotton of General Chesnut there.

On the train after leaving Lincolnton, as Captain Ogden is a refugee, has had no means of communicating with his 
home since New Orleans fell, and was sure to know how refugees contrive to live, I beguiled the time acquiring in 
formation from him. " When people are without a cent, how do they live? " I asked. " I am about to enter the 
noble band of homeless, houseless refugees, and Confederate pay does not buy one's shoe-strings. To which he re 
plied, " Sponge, sponge. Why did you not let Colonel Childs pay your bills? " " I have no bills, " said I. " We 
have never made bills anywhere, not even at home, where 
they would trust us, and nobody would trust me in Lincolnton. " " Why did you not borrow his money? General Chesnut could pay him at his leisure? " " I am by no means sure General Chesmit will ever again have any money," said I.

As the train rattled and banged along, and I waved my handkerchief in farewell to Miss Middleton, Isabella, and 
other devoted friends, I could only wonder if fate would 
ever throw me again with such kind, clever, agreeable, congenial companions? The McLeans refused to be paid for 
their rooms. No plummet can sound the depths of the hospitality and kindness of the North Carolina people.

Misfortune dogged us from the outset. Everything went wrong with the train. We broke down within two 
miles of Charlotte, and had to walk that distance; which was pretty rough on an invalid barely out of a fever. My 
spirit was further broken by losing an invaluable lace veil, which was worn because I was too poor to buy a cheaper 
one that is, if there were any veils at all for sale in our region. 
</p><p>
My husband had ordered me to a house in Charlotte kept by some great friends of his. They established me in 
the drawing-room, a really handsome apartment ; they made up a bed there and put in a washstand and plenty of water, 
with everything refreshingly clean and nice. But it continued to be a public drawing-room, open to all, so that I 
was half dead at night and wanted to go to bed. The piano was there and the company played it.

The landlady announced, proudly, that for supper there were nine kinds of custard. Custard sounded nice and 
light, so I sent for some, but found it heavy potato pie. I said: " Ellen, this may kill me, though Dover's powder did 
not." " Don't you believe dat, Missis; try." We barricaded ourselves in the drawing-room that night and left the 
next day at dawn. Arrived at the station, we had another disappointment; the train was behind time. There we sat 
on our boxes nine long hours ; for the cars might come at any moment, and we dared not move an inch from the spot. 
</p><p>
Finally the train rolled in overloaded with paroled prisoners, but heaven helped us : a kind mail agent invited us, 
with two other forlorn women, into his comfortable and clean mail-car. Ogden, true to his theory, did not stay at 
the boarding-house as we did. Some Christian acquaintances took him in for the night. This he explained with a grin.

My husband was at the Chester station with a carriage. We drove at once to Mrs. Da Vega's.
