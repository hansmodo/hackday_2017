Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
There is something very pleasant in the reflection, that 
while war, discord, and oppression triumph in so many 
parts of Europe, their domination does not extend to our 
country. I sometimes flatter myself that <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, in 
compassion to the afflicted in these countries, will continue 
to leave America in a proper state to be an asylum to them. 
</p><p>
Among those who have suffered severely from these 
evils, is Monsieur De Rochefoucauld Liancourt, formerly 
president of the National Assembly of France. His rank 
and character are known to you. He will be the bearer of 
this letter, and I am persuaded that his expectations from 
it will be realized. 
</p><p>
Yours, sincerely, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>.
