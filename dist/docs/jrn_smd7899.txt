It seems an age since I have opened this book. How the time has passed since, I have but a vague 
idea, beyond that it has passed very pleasantly. . . . 
Once since, I have been with Mrs. Badger to a Mr. Powell, who has started quite an extensive shoe-making establishment, in the vain attempt to get 
something to cover my naked feet. I am so much 
in need that I have been obliged to borrow Lydia's 
shoes every time I have been out since she returned. 
This was my second visit there, and I have no 
greater satisfaction than I had at first. He got my 
measure, I got his promise, and that is the end of it, 
thus far. His son, a young man of about twenty-four, 
had the cap of his knee shot off at <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>. 
Ever since he has been lying on his couch, unable 
to stand; and the probability is that he will never 
stand again. Instead of going out to the manufactory, Mrs. Badger has each time stopped at the 
house to see his mother (who, by the way, kissed 
me and called me "Sissie," to my great amusement) 
and there I have seen this poor young man. He 
seems so patient and resigned that it is really edifying to be with him. He is very communicative, 
too, and seems to enjoy company, no matter if he 
does say "her n" and "his n." Wonder why he doesn't say "shisen" too? The girls are highly 
amused at the description I give of my new acquaintance, but still more so at Mrs. Badger's account of 
the friendship of this poor young cripple, and his enjoyment of my visits. Of course it is only her own 
version, as she is very fond of jokes of all kinds.

Night before last Lydia got playing the piano for 
me in the darkened parlor, and the old tunes from 
her dear little fingers sent me off in a sea of dreams. 
She too caught the vision, and launched off in a 
well -remembered quadrille. The same scene flashed 
on us, and at each note, almost, we would recall a 
little circumstance, charming to us, but unintelligible to Anna, who occupied the other side. Together we talked over the dramatis persona. Mrs. Morgan, Jr., in dark blue silk with black flounces, 
a crimson chenille net on her black hair, sits at the 
piano in her own parlor. On the Brussels carpet 
stands, among others, Her Majesty, Queen Miriam, 
in a lilac silk, with bare neck and arms save for the 
protection afforded by a bertha of applique lace 
trimmed with pink ribbon, with hair a la madonna, 
and fastened low on her neck. Is she not handsome 
as she stands fronting the folding doors, her hand 
in tall Mr. Trezevant's, just as she commences to 
dance, with the tip of her black bottine just show 
ing? Vis-a-vis stands pretty Sophie, with her large, 
graceful mouth smiling and showing her pretty teeth to the best advantage. A low neck and short-sleeved green and white poplin is her dress, while 
her black hair, combed off from her forehead carelessly, is caught by a comb at the back and falls in 
curls on her shoulders. A prettier picture could not 
be wished for, as she looks around with sparkling 
eyes, eager for the dance to begin. There stands 
calm Dena in snuff-colored silk, looking so immeasurably the superior of her partner, who, I fancy, 
rather feels that she is the better man of the two, 
from his nervous way of shifting from one foot to the 
other, without saying a word to her. Nettie, in lilac 
and white, stands by the mantel laughing undisguisedly at her partner, rather than with him, yet 
so good-humoredly that he cannot take offense, 
but rather laughs with her. Lackadaisical Gertrude, 
whose face is so perfect in the daytime, looks pale 
and insipid by gaslight, and timidly walks through 
the dance. Stout, good-natured Minna smiles and 
laughs, never quite completing a sentence, partly 
from embarrassment, partly because she hardly 
knows how; but still so sweet and amiable that one 
cannot find fault with her for so trifling a misfortune. At this point, Lydia suggests, "And Sarah, 
do you forget her?" I laugh; how could I forget? 
There she stands in a light blue silk checked in tiny 
squares, with little flounces up to her knee. Her 
dress fits well, and she wears very pretty sleeves and 
collar of applique. Lydia asks if that is all, and how 
she looks. The same old song, I answer. She is 
looking at Miriam just now; you would hardly notice 
her, but certainly her hair is well combed. That 
is all you can say for her. Who is she dancing with? 
A youth fond of " dreams"; futile ones, at that, I 
laughingly reply. He must be relating one just now, 
for there is a very perceptible curl on her upper lip, 
and she is looking at him as though she thought 
she was the tallest. Lydia dashes off into a lively 
jig. "Ladies to the right!" I cried. She laughed 
too, well knowing that that part of the dance was 
invariably repeated a dozen times at least. She 
looked slyly up: "I am thinking of how many hands 
I saw squeezed," she said. I am afraid it did happen, 
once or twice.

Eighteen months ago ! What a change ! One who was prominent on such occasions Mr. Sparks 
they tell me is dead. May God have mercy on his soul, in the name of Jesus Christ! I did not ask even this revenge.
