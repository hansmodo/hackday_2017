My Dear Brother: I am so much in the woods here 
that I can't keep up with the times at all. Indeed, you 
in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> hear from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a> two or three 
days sooner than I do. I was taken aback by the news 
that Governor Moore had ordered the forcible seizure 
of the Forts Jackson and St. Philip, at or near the 
mouth of the Mississippi ; also of Forts Pike and Wood, 
at the outlets of Lakes Bogue and Pontchartrain. All 
these are small forts, and have rarely been occupied by 
troops. They are designed to cut off approach by sea 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a>, and were taken doubtless to prevent 
their being occupied, by order of General Scott. But 
the taking the arsenal at Baton Rouge is a different 
matter. It is merely an assemblage of store-houses, 
barracks, and dwelling-houses designed for the healthy 
residence of a garrison, to be thrown into one or the 
other of the forts in case of war. The arsenal is one of 
minor importance, yet the stores were kept there for the 
moral effect, and the garrison was there at the instance 
of the people of Louisiana. To surround with the 
military array, to demand surrender, and enforce the departure of the garrison, was an act of war. It amounted 
to a declaration of war and defiance, and was done by 
Governor Moore without the authority of the Legislature or Convention. Still, there is but little doubt but 
that each of these bodies, to assemble next week, will 
ratify and approve these violent acts, and it is idle to 
discuss the subject now. The people are mad on this 
question.

I had previously notified all that in the event of 
secession I should quit. As soon as a knowledge of these 
events reached me, I went to the vice-president, Dr. 
Smith, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, and told him that I regarded 
Louisiana as at war against the Federal Government, 
and that I must go. He begged me to wait until some 
one could be found to replace me. The supervisors feel 
the importance of system and discipline, and seem to 
think that my departure will endanger the success of 
this last effort to build up an educational establishment. 
. . . You may assert that in no event will I forego my 
allegiance to the United States as long as a single State 
is true to the old Constitution.

Yours,
