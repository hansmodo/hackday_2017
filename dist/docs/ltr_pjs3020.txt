DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor to address you from Saratoga on the 14th instant. On the next day, Amsbury and Adams (mentioned in <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague met'>General St. Clair</a>'s 
letter, copy whereof I transmitted to Congress by 
letter under cover to your Excellency) arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>. What passed between us, and what information he gave, is noted in paper Number One. Number Two is the letter which was inclosed between 
the bottoms of the canteen. 
</p><p>
If the information which Amsbury gives is to be 
relied upon, as I think it is, we shall soon be attacked at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> ; and although I think the 
force now there may be sufficient to hold that important post, yet I have no troops to oppose either Sir 
John Johnson, if he should penetrate to the Mohawk River, or any to prevent the communication between 
this and Fort George from being cut off; nor have I force, if these should not be attempted by the enemy, 
to march to the relief of <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. In this situation, I am under the necessity of applying to your 
Excellency for a reenforcement. 
</p><p>
From the time I left <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> till my return to 
that place, nothing, comparatively speaking, has been 
done towards throwing into <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> a stock of 
provisions of the meat kind ; and of the little that is 
left there, I fear to learn that a very considerable 
part is damaged ; and what is equally bad, if not 
worse, is, that we have very little hopes of a supply 
of fresh meat. A week or two may remedy the 
latter, but it may then be too late to convey a quantity to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. If, therefore, any salted pork 
or beef can be spared from <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, or elsewhere, 
I wish it may be ordered up, without the least delay. 
</p><p>
Should your Excellency order me a re-enforcement, 
permit me to suggest, that, if there are no vessels 
at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> or <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a> to transport the troops to 
<a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, it may be proper, by express, to direct the 
commanding officer at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> to send down from 
thence a sufficient number of sloops. 
</p><p>
Such is the inattention, in this department, that 
not less than a thousand barrels of flour are now 
lying at this post, and only five wagons employed to 
carry it to Fort George, the distance of fifteen miles. 
</p><p>
Permit me to beg that your Excellency will communicate the contents of this despatch to Congress, 
as I cannot find time to do myself the honor to 
write to them. 
</p><p>
I shall (consulting with the General Officers at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>) try to send an answer to Mr. Levius's 
letter, as from <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a></a>, in which I shall 
leave him to suppose (what I do not by any means 
believe) that <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a></a> has entered into his 
views. Your Excellency will please to mention my 
intention to <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a></a>, and to assure him that 
my only view is to serve the public. I am, dear 
Sir, most sincerely, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
