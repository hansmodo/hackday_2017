Mr DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I had last night the honor of receiving your Excellency's favor of the 1st instant, and impatiently wait 
your Excellency's sentiments on the steps I have 
taken since the 29th ultimo, an account of which has 
been transmitted by Major Morris. 
</p><p>
The justice of the observations, in your Excellency's letter, respecting the departure of the French 
fleet, are so obvious, that, if a consciousness of my 
duty to yield implicit obedience to your Excellency's 
commands did not ever make that obedience a plea 
sure, the reasoning alone must have pointed out 
the part I have to act. I have the pleasure to in 
form your Excellency, that, though the first struggles 
of passion on so important a disappointment were 
scarcely to be restrained, yet, in a few days, by taking advantage of the subsiding passion, I found means 
to restore the former harmony between the American 
and French officers of the army. The <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count D Estaing</a> 
and myself are in the same friendship as heretofore. 
The reason of the protest has been explained to him, 
and he is now perfectly satisfied. He has offered to 
come on with his land forces, and do every thing 
which I may request of him and his troops ; but this 
step has become unnecessary. 
The reason of drawing the protest was this; The 
Count himself wished to remain with us, but was, by 
his Captains, overruled in Council. As deviating from 
the voice of his Council would be attended with ill 
consequences to him in case of misfortune, it was 
supposed that the protest might justify his deviating 
from the voice of his Council, and acting a part 
agreeable to his own sentiments, and those of the co 
operating army. Prudence dictated it as our duty to 
keep it secret from all but him, your Excellency, 
and the Congress ; and no publication of it was ever 
thought of on our part ; and your Excellency may 
rely on my exertions to prevent it. Every thing in 
my power shall be done for repairing the injury sustained by the French fleet. 
</p><p>
The fleet off <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> harbour, of which I gave your Excellency an account yesterday, are eight ships of 
the line, ten frigates, one sloop, and a schooner. 
There can be no doubt of its being Lord Howe's fleet, 
watching the motions of the French fleet, to facilitate 
the relief of Rhode Island, and perhaps to cover the 
retreat of the British army from Rhode Island and 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, to other places where they are more 
needed. Those ships were out of sight yesterday 
morning at eight o clock, but I hear they afterwards 
hove in sight again. The report here is, that six 
thousand troops have arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=newport' rel='city'>Newport</a>. I know 
they are numerous, but cannot as yet ascertain the 
number. Your Excellency will please transmit a copy 
of this letter to Congress ; and believe me to be, with 
every sentiment of gratitude, respect, and esteem, 
your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant,
