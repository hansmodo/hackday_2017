MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE post of the day brought me your kind letter of 
26th ultimo. The more I am charmed with your 
bravery and activity in farming, the more I am mortified that my letters in answer to yours are so insignificant and insipid. I must leave all your agriculture to your judgment and the advice of your assist 
ants. I sent you more grass seeds with the furniture, 
which I hope has arrived before now. 
</p><p>
The times are so critical and parties so nearly balanced that I cannot in honor, nor consistently with 
my duty, abandon my post. There are so many 
wild projects and motions, and so many to support 
them, that I am become of more importance than 
usual, in the opinion of the soundest part of the community. We have very disagreeable business to do 
in finding ways and means for the expenses we have 
already incurred. It grieves me to the heart to see 
an increase of our debts and taxes, and it vexes me 
to see men opposing even these augmentations, who 
are every day pushing for measures that must involve us in war, and ten times greater expenses. 
But the inconsistencies and absurdities of men are no 
novelties to me. 
</p><p>
I have pleased myself with a hope that I should get 
home in April, but the general opinion is, we shall 
be obliged to remain here till the middle of May. I 
have little expectation of seeing you before election. 
You are so valorous and noble a farmer that I feel 
little anxious about agriculture. Manure in hills if 
you think best, but manure your barley ground and 
harrow it well. I have now the pleasing hope of seeing my honored mother again in comfortable health. 
I have suffered many melancholy hours both on her 
account and yours, and I think myself indebted, under <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, to your tender care and indefatigable 
assiduity for the prolongation of her life. 
</p><p>
If the yellow fever should make its appearance 
here, we shall soon fly ; but there is no symptom of 
it as yet. I am sometimes obliged to give critical 
votes, which expose me to the passions of parties ; 
but I have been wonderfully spared this session. They 
find it best to let me alone, for I get credit by their 
abuse. I am, most sincerely and most kindly, 
</p><p>
Your
