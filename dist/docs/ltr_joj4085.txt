Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The frequent solecisms, observable for some years past 
in the politics of the court of London, render it exceedingly 
difficult to divine how they will think and act under almost 
any given circumstances. 
</p><p>
It is manifestly as much their interest to be well with us, 
as it is ours to be well with them ; and yet the gratification 
of resentments, occasioned by disappointment, seems to take 
the lead of more elevated and useful principles of action. 
</p><p>
They expect much from the trade of America, and yet 
they take pains to cut off every source within their reach 
by which we may make remittances. It is strange that 
they should wish us to buy, and yet be so industrious to put 
it out of our power to pay. Such a system must cause 
loss of money to their merchants, and loss of reputation to 
ours. I wish most sincerely that credit was at an end, and 
that we could purchase nothing abroad but for ready 
money. Our exportations would then be equally profitable, 
and as our importations would be diminished, we should 
have less to pay. Domestic manufactures would then be 
more encouraged, and frugality and economy become more 
prevalent. 
</p><p>
What impression the conduct of Captain Stanhope may 
make on the minister, to me appears uncertain. Certain 
however it is, that mutual civility and respect must, in the 
nature of things, precede mutual benevolence and kindness. 
The manner of your reception and treatment indicates 
their attention to this consideration, and yet the detention 
of the posts, the strengthening their garrisons in our neighbourhood, the encouragement said to be given to settlers in 
those parts, and various other circumstances speak a language very different from that of kindness and good-will. 
They may hold the posts, but they will hold them as 
pledges of enmity ; and the time must and will come, 
when the seeds of discontent, resentment, and hatred, 
which such measures always sow, will produce very bitter 
fruit. 
</p><p>
I am well informed that some of the loyalists advise and 
warmly press the detention of the posts. It is strange that 
men, who for ten years have done nothing but deceive, 
should still retain any credit. I speak of them collectively, 
among them there are men of merit : but to my knowledge 
some of the most violent, the most bitter and implacable, 
and yet most in credit, are men who endeavoured to play 
between both parties, and vibrated from side to side as the 
appearance of success attracted them. Nay, the very 
accounts of losses which many of them have presented, 
afford conclusive evidence of their inattention to truth and 
common decency. Such, however, has been the infatuation 
of British counsels, that what was manifest to others, was 
problematical, if not entirely dark to them. 
</p><p>
As to their present minister, he has neither been long 
enough in administration, nor perhaps in the world, for a 
decided judgment to be formed either of his private or 
public character. He seems to possess firmness as well as 
abilities ; and if to these be added information, and comprehensive as well as patriotic views, he may be worthy of 
his father. England will probably be either much the better, or much the worse for him. 
</p><p>
We are anxious to receive letters from you on the subject of the posts, that in either event we may be prepared. 
In the one case, I should think it very justifiable in Congress to take a certain step, that would be longer and more 
sensibly felt by Britain than the independence of these 
States.
