<a rel='month origin' value='7'>July</a> <a rel='day origin' value='11'>11th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=fauquier white sulphur springs' rel='city origin'>Fauquier White Sulphur Springs</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. We did hear cannon to-day. The woman who slandered <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis's</a> republican court, of which we 
are honorable members, by saying they well, were not young ; that they wore gaudy colors, and dressed badly I 
took an inventory to-day as to her, charms. She is darkly, deeply, beautifully freckled; she wears a wig which is 
kept in place by a tiara of mock jewels ; she has the fattest of arms and wears black bead bracelets.

The one who is under a cloud,, shadowed as a Yankee spy, has confirmed our worst suspicions. She exhibited unholy joy, as she reported seven hundred sick soldiers in the hospital at Culpeper, and that <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> had sent a 
flag of truce to Washington.

What a night we had ! Maria had seen suspicious persons hovering about all day, and Mrs. Preston a ladder 
which could easily be placed so as to reach our rooms. Mary Hammy saw lights glancing about among the trees, 
and we all heard guns. So we sat up. Consequently, I am writing in bed to-day. A letter from my husband saying, 
in particular : " Our orders are to move on, the date, July 10th. " Here we are still and no more prospect of movement now than when I last wrote to you. It is true, how 
ever, that the enemy is advancing slowly in our front, and we are preparing to receive him. He comes in great force, 
being more than three times our number."

The spy, so-called, gave us a parting shot : said <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> had arrested her brother in order that he might take a 
fine horse which the aforesaid brother was riding. Why? <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a>, at a moment's notice, could have any horse in 
South Carolina, or Louisiana, for that matter. This man was arrested and sent to Richmond, and will be acquitted 
as they always are," said Brewster. " They send them first to Richmond to see and hear everything there; then 
they acquit them, and send them out of the country by way of Norfolk to see everything there. But, after all, what 
does it matter They have no need for spies : our newspapers keep no secrets hid. The thoughts of our hearts are all 
revealed. Everything with us is open and aboveboard.

" At Bethel the Yankees fired too high. Every daily paper is jeering them about it yet. They ll fire low enough 
next time, but no newspaper man will be there to get the benefit of their improved practise, alas! "
