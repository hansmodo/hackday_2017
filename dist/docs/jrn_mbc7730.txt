<a rel='month origin' value='8'>August</a> <a rel='day origin' value='2'>2d</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> again. Artillery parked and a line of battle formed before Atlanta. When we asked 
Brewster what Sam meant to do at Atlanta he answered, Oh oh, like the man who went, he says he means to stay 
there! " Hope he may, that's all.

Spent to-day with Mrs. McCord at her hospital. She is dedicating her grief for her son, sanctifying it, one might 
say, by giving up her soul and body, her days and nights, to the wounded soldiers at her hospital. Every moment of her 
time is surrendered to their needs.

To-day General Taliaferro dined with us. He served with <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> at the second battle of Manassas and at Fredericksburg, where <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> won his major-general's spurs. On the battle-field, <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a>, he said, " has military inspiration." 
We were thankful for that word. All now depends on that army at Atlanta. If that fails us, the game is up.
