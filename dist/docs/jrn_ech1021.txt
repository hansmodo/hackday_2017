McCowan and I started ourspecting with our pans and shovels early Friday
morning but we had scarcely reached the diggings before it commenced raining and we returned to camp. So today we started out again and coming to what we supposed to be a good place, we sunk a hole three feet wide and about six feet deep without finding a particle of ore. We gave up the spot and proceeded on until noon, when we placed our tools against a stump and returned to camp for dinner. We then learned that Mr. Cox was getting ready to start for Mariposa tomorrow morning. As we intend to move on with him, we thought it useless to continue our search any longer and brought up our tools in the afternoon. These diggings are nearly dug out and we were only stopping here for a short time until the weather became settled and the roads passable to the Mariposa Mines about 30 miles distant. But very few are making more than their expenses here and nearly all will leave soon.

In company with Atkins who is still sick I took a walk up to Burns' store, thinking a little walk would do him good. I carried my letters with me, the store being the express office, to forward to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> and there be mailed for the United States. The express runs up and down once a month from all the mines to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, and carries letters down upon prepaying 50 cents upon each, and brings up letters for two dollars with the postage added, to those whose names are enrolled. This express is connected with Adams & Co.'s Express in the Atlantic States, and is a great convenience to persons here. They are favored but little at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> post office and have to hire the privilege of allowing their clerks to examine letters in the office at night after it is closed. They deserve much credit for their energy and enterprise.

While at the store, I saw a lot of butter which they
sell at $2.50 per pound. I examined it particularly. I have not seen any for so long that it has become quite a curiosity. We purchased a small loaf of soft bread for Atkins for 75 cents. Heretofore we have several times attempted to manufacture some good cakes out of flour, known in this country as "flap jacks," but they always came out heavy dough things which we could hardly eat. This evening we tried it again and succeeded almost beyond our most sanguine expectations. We had mixed up a little flour and water for the purpose of souring, but when we came to look at it this afternoon we found it had not turned. We therefore added a little acid which soon made it sour enough. We then mixed it up with a few handfuls of flour, and water, and added a small quantity of saleratus, and some sugar. We took our frying pan and placed a few bits of fat pork in it and poured the batter in and baked or fried it for some time. Such delicious cakes as we had, I have not tasted for a long time. With a little molasses and pork they eat very well. Our progress in the art of cooking is slow but this, I suppose, results from the want of a teacher. We have to experiment on everything until we get it to suit our tastes, and what is learned in this way will not soon be forgotten. We can now get up some fine dishes!
