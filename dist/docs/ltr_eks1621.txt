WHERE CAMP WASHINGTON ONCE WAS,

April 17, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>. 
</p><p>
I do not know the date of my last letter, a short 
history will explain the cause. On the night of the 
seventh, I was writing a letter to you in my tent, when, 
in common with the other officers of the regiment, I 
was summoned to Major Scott's tent. Scott was 
swelling with importance and had borrowed a candle 
from the adjutant, being too poor to purchase. He 
held in his hand a note and commenced: 
</p><p>
" Are you all here ? " then began reading the note: 
</p><p>
" Major Scott, Sir: You " - a pause. 
</p><p>
" Where is Captain Ruggles ? Gentlemen, pay 
attention, we shall catch it before tomorrow night! " 
</p><p>
Myself: " What ! the yellow fever ? " 
</p><p>
Major Scott: " We are to go on desperate service." 
And so after beginning and stopping twenty times 
he finally managed to read a brief note from General 
Worth ordering him with the regiment to report to 
him on the morning of the eighth at daylight in the 
plaza, each one carrying in his haversack five days 
provisions and his greatcoat on his back. I asked 
Scott if he knew where we were going. " He thought 
he did, we would all find out before tomorrow night 
but some would not live to tell of it if he led them ! " 
etc., intimating that we were going on desperate service for which we were selected in consequence of his 
superior abilities, etc. I finally remarked that I 
thought he knew nothing about it, and that I would 
bet we were going after horses and mules, in consequence of his peculiar fitness. 
</p><p>
I went to my tent and closed my desk, in which there 
were besides all your dear letters a considerable 
amount of money belonging to the regiment and to 
the men, and carried it to Major Kirby, as I dared 
not leave it in my tent during my absence. On my 
return last night we found the army all gone. Uncle 
had carried my desk with him not liking to leave it 
with any one, knowing its contents, so I am without 
my dressing and writing apparatus. 
</p><p>
To resume. I had guessed right in regard to our 
duty. On reporting on the morning of the eighth, we were ordered on board the steamer " McKim" to go up the Alvarado River after horses and mules. We 
arrived at Alvarado, which is near the mouth of the 
river, just at sunset. Here is a fine harbor with about 
two fathoms on the bar at low water, and it is a much 
better point for a large city and a commercial depot 
than at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a>. The town which before the war 
contained between three and four thousand inhabitants is now in the possession of our navy, Captain 
Mayo being the Governor. It is much like other 
Mexican towns, a large church, a few decent houses 
owned by the rich, the residue mean and dirty, filled 
with ticks, fleas, vermin, idleness, and licentiousness. 
In the morning we proceeded up the river which is 
truly beautiful broad, deep, and clear, with rich 
verdant banks. 
</p><p>
About thirty miles from its mouth we arrived at 
the town of Tlacatalpin. Here the river forks the left 
branch taking the name of San Juan. Tlacatalpin is 
much the neatest town I have yet seen in Mexico, 
containing some three thousand inhabitants who are 
industrious in comparison with all others I have seen 
in this country. The women have the reputation of 
being virtuous, the men honest. They are at least 
half white, being less stained with negro blood than 
in those portions of Mexico which I have seen. Many 
cocoanut trees in full bearing were growing here, some 
ripe pineapples, indeed, most of the tropical fruits, 
excepting oranges. We found a great abundance of 
melons, green corn, cabbages, and some Irish potatoes 
which were tolerable. The quarter-master found it 
would be some days before he could get horses in from 
the surrounding country, so we left the steamboat 
and were quartered in a house for picking cotton. It 
was very dirty, of course, but it gave the men room 
to lie down in the shade which is absolutely necessary 
in this hot climate. The weather was awfully hot. We 
had no change of clothes and you can judge how uncomfortable and disgusting we were in a few days. 
We remained at Tlacatalpin from Friday until Tuesday evening. The march from that place to Vera 
Cruz was most horrible, the men without bread, 
and had to be up all night watching the horses. We 
have just arrived. I am completely worn out and 
have just seen the villainous order of promotions and 
brevets in which the Fifth is entirely neglected. I am 
utterly disgusted with the service and were it not for 
you and the dear children would resign at once, but 
for your sakes I must continue to endure. 
</p><p>
Santa Anna with fifteen thousand men is, we learn, 
strongly fortified in a mountain pass about forty miles 
from here. It is supposed <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> fought him 
yesterday, as cannon were heard. We all think it will 
be the last fight of the war as Santa Anna has his ministers with him evidently to negotiate, if he is beaten. 
</p><p>
April 19. . . . We are to march this evening or at 
daybreak tomorrow.
