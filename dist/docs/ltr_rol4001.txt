Dear John,
</p><p>
I am much mortified at not hearing from you. I wrote 
to you last week, and am just now setting out for Bristol 
in order to meet Mrs. Livingston. I could wish to find 
Mrs. Jay there also. Pray send some of our colleagues 
along, otherwise I must be more confined than either my 
health or inclination will allow. You have doubtless seen 
the account brought by the Rifleman from London, by 
which it appears we shall have at least 34,000 commissioners. 
</p><p>
If your Congress have any spirit, they will at least build 
fourteen or fifteen light boats capable of carrying a twelve-pounder, to secure Hudson River, which is to be the chief 
scene of action. The carpenters employed on the frigate 
would build two or three a day, if they w r ere built in the 
manner of batteaux, which is the true construction. 
</p><p>
I wish you would direct Gaine to send me his paper. 
God bless you. 
</p><p>
Yours, most sincerely, 
</p><p>
