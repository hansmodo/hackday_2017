DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I received a few days agone your favor of June 2nd. 
You mention an affair, concerning which I had determined 
to write in the beginning of this quarter. I have thought 
much of an office in which to study the law. Should you 
return home next spring and be yourself at leisure to instruct 
me, I should certainly prefer that to studying anywhere 
else. But if you are still detained in Europe, I should 
wish to live in some place where there might be society 
sufficient for relaxation at times, but not enough to en 
courage dissipation. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> I should for several reasons 
wish to avoid. The principal ones are that it is unfavorable to study, and that it would be almost doubly expensive. 
Mr. Parsons of Newbury, has been mentioned, and I should 
be very glad to study with him. However it is not per 
haps a matter of much consequence whose office I am in, 
if my time is well spent in it. I look forward with mingled 
pain and pleasure to the time when I shall finish the collegiate term. I have made it my endeavor to be intimate 
only with the best characters in my class, and there are 
several with whom I enjoy many social half hours. As 
our pursuits are confined here merely to literature, it is 
necessary to be a very close student in order to acquire a 
respectable character. Out of an hundred and forty students that are here, there is undoubtedly every grade, from 
the most amiable disposition to the worst, from the smallest 
genius to the greatest, and from the complete ignoramus to 
the youth of learning. There are some who do not study twelve hours in the course of a twelvemonth, and some who 
study as much almost every day, and it always happens 
that their reputation is in an exact ratio to the attention 
they pay to studying. The good scholar is esteemed, even 
by the idle ; but the bad one is despised as much by those 
who are like him, as he is by the judicious. This is the 
common course, but in these peaceful mansions there is 
the same spirit of intrigue and party, and as much inclination to cabal, as may be discovered at courts. It has not 
the same opportunities to show itself, and remains for the 
most part concealed ; but there arc certain circumstances 
and situations in which it breaks forth with great vehemence. 
This has lately been the case with my class. It is customary early in the first quarter of the senior year for each 
class to meet and choose by ballot one of its members to 
deliver a valedictory oration on the ensuing 21st of June, 
and four others to collect the theses, which arc published 
by the class when they take their degrees. [We] have 
lately gone through this business. There were different 
parties for three persons as orator, and there was a great 
deal of intriguing carried on. One only could be successful, 
and Little, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=newburyport" rel="city">Newburyport</a>, was finally chosen, a person, 
who to an excellent genius, unites an amiable disposition, 
and an unblemished moral character. The class did me 
the honor to choose me among the theses collectors, and for 
the mathematical part. Little did I think, -when you gave 
me those lessons at Auteuil, which you call our suppers, 
that they would be productive of this effect. It is a laborious task, and will confine my studies for the ensuing 
year much more to the mathematics than I should have 
done if I had been left to my own disposal. . . .
