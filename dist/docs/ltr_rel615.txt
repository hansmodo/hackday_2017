<p><i>[Biographer's Note: My sister, after the Christmas holidays, went from Ashby to Baltimore,
Cousins George and Eleanor Goldsborough taking her with them to their
town house.  I think my father always wanted his daughters with him.
When they were away he missed them, their love, care, and attention.
The next letter I find is to Mildred in Baltimore:] </i></p>
<p>
                            Lexington, Virginia, January 27, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1867">1867</a>.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mil" rel="child met">My Precious Daughter</a>:  Your letter to your mother gave us the
satisfactory information of your continued good health, for I feared
that your long silence had been caused by indisposition of body,
rather than that due to writing.  I hope you will not let so long an
interval between your letters occur again, for you know I am always
longing to hear from you, when I cannot see you, and a few lines, if
only to say you are well, will prevent unpleasant apprehensions.  I
am delighted at your increased bodily dimensions, and your diminished
drapery.  One hundred and twenty-eight avoirdupois is approximately
a proper standard.  Seven more pounds will make you all right.  But
I fear before I see you the unnatural life, which I fear you will lead
in Baltimore, will reduce you to skin and bone.  Do not go out to
many parties, preserve your simple tastes and manners, and you will
enjoy more pleasure.  Plainness and simplicity of dress, early hours,
and rational amusements, I wish you to practise.  You must thank
Cousins Eleanor and George for all their kindness to you, and remember
me to all friends.  If you see your uncle Marshall, present my kind
regards to him, and my best wishes for his health and happiness.  I
hope you will see Robert.  I heart that he stayed at Mr. Edward Dallam's
when in Baltimore, but do not know whether he will return there from
Lynwood.  I was sorry to hear that you lost your purse.  Perhaps the
finder was more in want than you are, and it may be of service to
him, and you can do without it.  A little money is sometimes useful.
You must bear in mind that it will not be becoming in a Virginia girl
now to be fine or fashionable, and that gentility as well as self-
respect requires moderation in dress and gaiety.  While her people
are suffering, she should practise self-denial and show her sympathy
in their affliction.  We are all pretty well.  Your poor <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse met">mother</a> suffers
more pain than usual during this inclement weather.  Your sister is
devoted to the snow and ice, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=agl" rel="child met">Agnes</a> is becoming a very good
housekeeper.  She has received a letter from a gentleman, whose
judgement she respects, recommending her to acquire that useful
knowledge, and assuring her that it will not only promote domestic
happiness, but will add greatly to connubial bliss.  This is a great
encouragement to her.  Our young friends, the law students and cadets,
all inquire after you and wish for your return.  You know that is my
wish and hope, so whenever you are ready to return you will know that
I am waiting to receive you.  I will leave your mother and sisters to
give you all domestic news.  Tell Annette I have been looking for her
in every stage since her letter last fall, and that I hope for her
arrival daily.  Nipper is well, and endeavors, by stern gravity, to
repress the frivolity of Baxter.  All unite in much love, and I am,
as ever,
</p><p>
Your father, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="me">R. E. Lee.</a>
