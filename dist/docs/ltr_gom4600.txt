Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 12th of September reached me a few days 
ago. In the proposition of S. J. and Co. I saw the means of 
saving somewhat to the United States, without incurring the 
odium of a payment in depreciated paper ; but since a de-^ 
termination to pay in value is adopted, I heartily and entirely approve of the rejection of their offer. 
Before the receipt of your letter Mr Short communicated to 
me, in general terms, the intention to make good the depreciation on the money paid here before, and told me at the same 
time that it seemed to be in contemplation to pay in specie, 
about which he felt himself much embarrassed ; for in that 
case there would be a loss of about five per cent, which, with 
the commissions on loans, &tc. &tc. would increase the debt 
about one tenth, instead of paying it with advantage. And 
this arises from a circumstance which is, I believe, the common attendant of paper money, viz. that specie is higher in 
proportion than foreign exchanges. 
</p><p>
This will be best understood by assigning what I conceive 
to be the cause of that difference. I begin by rejecting the 
theories of speculative men, who suppose that bills of exchange 
are drawn and purchased for payment of -reciprocal debts, and 
the like. I reject equally the stock-jobbing operations of 
bankers, and confining my view to the ordinary course of 
things, I observe, that when a man purchases in France goods 
which are to be sold in England, he pays for those goods by 
the proceeds of bills drawn on England, and as he makes the 
acquisition of the goods with a view to the future sales, he 
governs himself by the usual price of such goods in the country to which they are to be sent. 
</p><p>
The rate of exchange, therefore, enters into his consideration 
only so far as by means thereof the price he is to pay for his 
goods may be affected. On the other hand, he who has 
bought goods on credit in England, which he vends in France, 
regards the exchange only in so far as it governs the price at 
which he must sell his goods. Thus the pound sterling being 
worth about twenty-five livres, if the exchange is at thirty livres 
for the pound sterling, he must advance one fifth, or twenty 
per cent on the price of English goods ; and for the same 
reason, the English agent can afford to give an advance of 
twenty per cent on French wines. Now in proportion as the 
price of English goods advances, the consumption of them 
lessens, and consequently the purchase of bills on London to pay for them diminishes ; and in proportion as the exchange 
advances, which is of course a decrease in the the real price of 
French goods, the purchase of them increases, and of course 
the sale of bills on London to pay for them, and thus the depreciation of the paper currency checks, by eventual operation, 
its immediate effect on foreign exchange. 
</p><p>
But the price of specie depends on a different cause. 
Specie, in a time of peace and good government, is but the 
sign of vveahh, and not the substance ; so that no more of it is 
found in a country, than is necessary for the interchange of 
those commodities, which form the real wealth of such country. 
And by the bye it follows, that in proportion to the degree of 
credit resulting from a vigorous execution of good laws, the 
necessity of money decreases, and it becomes plentiful by the 
prevalence of confusion, without any actual increase or decrease 
of the mass. But when a paper circulation is forced forward, 
prudent men first, and all men afterwards, desire to realize 
this property. Land is not always a convenient object for 
this purpose, because the subsequent sale is difficult, and 
merchandises are objectionable from their bulk and decay. 
The precious metals, therefore, naturally obtain a preference, 
and as their quantity is by no means proportionate to the real 
wealth of the country, their price is increased more rapidly 
than that of other things. But the foreign merchant, observing 
this advance, declines drawing bills unless he can get some 
thing near the price which his coin, if brought into the country, would produce, and thus the exchange follows the price 
of coin in the course of depreciation instead of preceding it. 
If I were to hazard a conjecture, as to the corollary of this 
reasoning, it would be that the quantity of the precious metals 
rather increases than diminishes in a country where paper 
money circulates. 
</p><p>
I make no apology for this digression, because if it conveys 
no information, it tends at least to explain one fact, and to 
place some others in a different light from that in which they 
are usually viewed. To return then to the subject of your letter, I must tell you, that about the same time that Mr Short's 
despatches arrived, a plan was imagined by the colonists of St 
Domingo and proposed to the administration, for repairing the 
ravages committed by their slaves in the late insurrection, by 
appropriating to that purpose the debt of the United States to 
France. One of them came to converse with me on the subject ; but supposing it to be some new scheme of speculation, 
I refused to listen to him. A few days after, however, the 
Minister of the Marine told me that he had sent him, and de 
sired me to consider the matter and see if something could not 
be done. In consequence of this I mentioned to Mr Short, 
who is now in Holland, a plan which appeared to me useful to 
the two countries ; and before his departure we agreed on certain principles to govern in that business, conformably to which 
the minister is now acting. I shall send you his address to 
the Assembly on the subject, and if the thing he has in view is 
effected, I will detail it to you ; if not, I will spare you the perusal of so much useless writing. 
</p><p>
As to the state of things here, I would convey it to you as 
fully as propriety will admit ; but I know not yet by what opportunity this letter will go, and the Post Office was never 
more abused under the most despotic ministers than it is at present, notwithstanding the decrees to the contrary. Every 
letter I receive bears evident marks of patriotic curiosity. This anxious spirit of pettifogging villany proves the fear of 
those who make use of it ; and truly they have reason to fear, 
for every day proves more clearly that their new constitution is good for nothing. 
</p><p>
Those, whom I had warned in season of the mischiefs they 
were preparing, endeavor, now that it is too late, to lay the 
blame on others by way of excusing themselves, but the truth 
is that instead of seeking the public good by doing what was 
right, each sought his own advantage by flattering the public 
opinion. They dare not now propose the amendments, which 
they perceive and acknowledge to be indispensable. They 
have besides no confidence in each other, for every one feels 
a reason against it, and meets moreover with daily proofs that 
his copatriots are no better than himself. 
</p><p>
The Assembly (as you who know such bodies will naturally 
suppose) commits every day new follies, and if this unhappy 
country be not plunged anew into the horrors of despotism, it 
is not their fault. They have lately made a master stroke to 
that effect. They have resolved to attack their neighbors, unless they dissipate the assemblies of French emigrants, who 
have taken refuge in their dominions. These neighbors are 
members of the German Empire, and France threatens to carry into their country, not fire and sword, but la liberte. Now 
as this last word does not, in the acceptation of German courts, mean so much liberty as insurrection, you will see that the pre 
text is given for hostilities without violating the law of nations. 
</p><p>
Add to this, that three French armies of fifty thousand men 
each are ordered to assemble on the frontiers. One under 
your old acquaintance Rochambeau, in Flanders ; one under our 
friend Lafayette in Lorraine, so as to penetrate by the Moselle 
river into the electorate of Treves; and one under a Monsieur Luckner in Alsace. This last T am told has but slender abili 
ties; the other two you are acquainted with. Putting all 
other things out of the question it is self-evident, that the Empire 
must bring force to oppose force thus ordered, and in consequence it is not to be doubted, that fifty thousand Prussian and 
fifty thousand Austrian troops will make their appearance as 
speedily as circumstances can permit. 
</p><p>
Now I am thoroughly convinced, that if this country were 
united under a good government, and in peace with England, 
they could set the rest of Europe at defiance ; but you have no 
idea, my dear Sir, of a society so loosely organized. America 
in the worst of times was much better, because at least the 
criminal law was executed, not to mention the mildness % of our 
manners. My letters predicting their present situation may 
perhaps have appeared like the wanderings of exaggerated fancy, but believe me, they are within the coldest limits of truth. 
Their army is undisciplined to a degree you can hardly conceive. Already great numbers desert to what they expect will 
become the enemy. Their Gardes Nationales, who have turned 
out as volunteers, are in many instances that corrupted scum of 
overgrown population, of which large cities purge themselves, 
and which, without constitution to support the fatigues, or courage to encounter the perils of war, have every vice and every 
disease, which can render them the scourge of their friends and 
the scoff of their foes. 
</p><p>
The finances are so deplorably bad, that the bankruptcy, 
which actually exist by the depreciation of the paper money, 
must soon be declared by stopping payment in some quarter or 
other, unless those effectual remedies be applied, which seem to 
be beyond the power of the government, and beyond the talents 
of those who administer it. The discontent is general, but it 
does not break out, partly because the antipathy to the Aristocrats, and the fear of their tyranny still operates, and partly 
because no safe opportunity offers. Every one is bewildered 
in his meditations as to the event, and like a fleet at anchor in 
a fog, no one will set sail for fear of running foul. 
</p><p>
If they come to blows on the borders a curious scene will, I 
think, present itself. The first success on either side will decide 
the opinions of a vast number, who have in fact no opinion, but 
only the virtuous determination to adhere to the strongest party ; 
and you may rely on it, that if the enemy be tolerably successful, a person who shall visit this country two years hence will 
inquire with astonishment by what means a nation, which in 
the year <a href='/results.php?year=1788'>1788</a> was devoted to its King, became in <a href='/results.php?year=1790'>1790</a> unanimous in throwing off authority, and in <a href='/results.php?year=1792'>1792</a> as unanimous in submitting to it. The reasons are given to you in my 
letter of the 29th April, <a href='/results.php?year=1789'>1789</a>, and my fears expressed in that 
letter seem now to be on the eve of reality. The King means 
well, and may perhaps by his moderation finally succeed in 
saving his country. I hope much from this circumstance ; but, 
alas, the moderation of one who has been so wounded, so insulted, seems to be but a slender dependence, and yet I verily 
believe it to be the best, and I had almost said the only dependence.

December 31st. 
</p><p>
A courier arrived last night with despatches, which are to be 
communicated to the Assembly this morning. The Emperor 
informs the King, that he has given orders to General Bender, 
who commands in the Low Countries, to protect the electorate 
of Treves with all his forces. I did not mention, as I ought to 
have done, that the courts of Berlin and Vienna have concluded a treaty for the protection of the German Empire and 
maintenance of its rights. You will have seen that the Emperor, having adopted the determination of the Diet respecting 
the claims of those princes, who have certain feudal rights 
preserved to them by the treaty of Westphalia in Alsace and 
Lorraine, reminded the King, that the dominion of France over 
those provinces is conceded by that treaty. 
</p><p>
The Dutch government has proposed a treaty with the Emperor, as sovereign of the Low Countries, for mutual aid and 
protection, in case of insurrections, which offer is accepted. 
</p><p>
All this is explained by the intrigues of France to excite 
revolt in Holland and Flanders, and the completion of such a 
treaty will place the Emperor at ease, should he operate against 
this country next spring. I am, &c.
