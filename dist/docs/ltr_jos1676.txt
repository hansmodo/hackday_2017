My Dear Brother : . . . Our finances are bubbling up 
and down in that feverish state where a panic might 
easily come. Chase is a man of ability, but in recent 
measures he has failed. I have been generally the laboring one in the Senate, on these measures, though very 
often my judgment has been against them. I have felt 
like a subordinate officer, who, while he does not approve 
the plan of operations, yet deems it his duty fairly to 
execute his part of it rather than by Ifault-finding to 
impair it. The war is daily driving us to extraordinary 
measures, and our form of Government is not unit enough 
to carry them out. We are embarrassed by state banks, 
state laws, and local issues and interests. The other 
day a determined effort was made in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> to run 
gold up to 200, but was promptly met by a free sale by 
the Government of gold and exchange, and the movement failed. It was aided by this very bad news from 
Fort Pillow, not so bad from the loss of men, but from 
the question of retaliation raised by the massacre of 
negro troops. We all feel that we must either disband 
negro troops or protect them. It is fearful to think 
about the measures that may be necessary, but what else 
can we do ? An investigation will be made by the Secretary of War and by Congress, and if the rebels are 
determined to massacre prisoners, then a new and terrible stage of this war will be commenced. . . .

Affectionately yours,
