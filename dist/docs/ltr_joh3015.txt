SIR, 
</p><p>
I am to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 10th instant, and to acquaint you that it is now under the consideration of Congress. 
</p><p>
The inclosed resolves I do myself the honor to transmit, as necessary for your information. I have written to <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, and the Commissioners 
for Indian Affairs, respecting the same. 
</p><p>
In obedience to the commands of Congress, I have inclosed von two copies of sundry resolves they have passed relative to the treatment of our prisoners by 
Captain Forster, in Canada. I am to request you will take the proper steps to send one of them to General Howe, and the other to <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>. 
I transmit, also, a third copy for your own use.
</p><p>
Should the United States of America give their sanction to the Jesuitical and villanous distinction which Captain Forster adopts to justify his conduct, 
there would be no end to butchering our prisoners. They have, therefore, very properly reprobated it ; and, in the genuine spirit of freedom, resolved, that 
such cruelty as shall be inflicted on prisoners in their possession, by savages or foreigners taken into pay by the King of Great Britain, shall be considered as 
done by his orders, and recourse be immediately had to retaliation. It is to be hoped their determination will have the desired effect, and that for the future, 
such barbarous scenes will never be acted under the eye and approbation of a British officer ; for there is the greatest reason to believe, that Captain Forster 
engaged the Indians to join him, on the express condition of giving up to them all such prisoners as might fall into his hands. His subsequent conduct, indeed, renders this conjecture more than probable. 
</p><p>
considerable time, and surrendered at last, but on absolute necessity ; on 
which consideration, and on which alone, it is resolved, that the said 
sponsion be ratified ; and that an equal number of captives from the 
enemy, of the same rank and condition, be restored to them, as stipulated by the said sponsion ; 
</p><p>
" That, previous to the delivery of the prisoners to be returned on our 
part, the British commander in Canada be required to deliver into our 
hands the authors, abettors, and perpetrators of the horrid murder committed on the prisoners, to suffer such punishment as their crime deserves ; and also, to make indemnification for the plunder at the Cedars, 
taken contrary to the faith of the capitulation ; and that, until such delivery and indemnification be made, the said prisoners be not delivered ; 
</p><p>
That if the enemy shall commit any further violences, by putting to death, torturing, or otherwise ill treating the prisoners retained by them, 
or any of the hostages put into their hands, recourse be had to retaliation, as the sole means of stopping the progress of human butchery ; 
and that, for that purpose, punishments of the same kind and degree be inflicted on an equal number of the captives from them in our possession, till they shall be taught to respect the violated rights of nations ; 
</p><p>
" That a copy of the above report and resolutions be transmitted to the Commander-in-chief of the Continental forces, to be by him sent 
to Generals Howe and Burgoyne." Journals of Congress, July 10th. I have the honor to be, with perfect esteem. Sir, your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President. 
</p><p>
One o clock, P. M. This moment your favor, per post of the 11th instant, came to hand. I shall lay it before Congress on Monday evening.
