FORT HILL, 25th August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1830">1830</a>, 
</p><p>
SIR: I received, on the 6th instant, your letter dated the 19th June, but, 
which, I suppose, was intended for the 19th July, with its enclosures. On 
the 24th of June I received the note of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">Mr. Forsyth</a>, covering a copy of 
his letter to you of the 17th same month; but, owing to some delay in the 
conveyance, for which I am unable to account, I did not receive your letter 
of the 7th June covering a copy of your letter to Mr. Forsyth, till the 14th 
July, 
</p><p> 
You regret that I did not receive your letter of the 7th June before I 
wrote mine of the 28th of the same month, on the ground, to use your own 
language, that it would have prevented me "from falling into the gross errors you have from the unfounded inferences you have drawn from Mr. Forsyth's letter to me." You cannot more sincerely regret than I do that 
any delay in the mail deprived me of the advantage of the statement in your 
letter to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">Mr. Forsyth</a>, seeing that you deemed it material to a correct understanding of the facts; but I must say, after a careful perusal of your letter to him, as well as yours to myself, I am utterly at a loss to perceive the 
"gross errors" of which you accuse me. As far as I can understand you, 
they seem to consist in the supposition that I inferred from Mr. Forsyth's 
letter that you applied to him personally to obtain the information from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>, of what took place in the cabinet on theSeminole question; 
whereas, in fact, you applied not to him, but to Mr. James Hamilton, of New York; and that it was he, and not you, who applied to Mr. Forsyth to obtain 
the information. If there be a difference in principle between the two statements, I can only say that I am not responsible for it. The charge of " error" ought to be made against Mr. Forsyth, and not me. His words are: 
"Having, at the request of the President to be informed what took place in 
the cabinet of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Monroe</a> on the subject of the Seminole campaign, laid 
before him a copy (except the omission of a name) of a letter from Mr. 
Crawford, which has been since communicated to you," &e. &c. Now, 
Sir, if I had inferred from these words, as you suppose I did, that you had 
personally applied to Mr. Forsyth to obtain the information for you, I would 
have done no more than what I fairly might, without the imputation of 
" gross errors, " But I made no such inference; on the contrary, I have used 
almost the very words of Mr. Forsyth. My language is: " I had supposed, 
from the complexion of your letters to me. that the copy of Mr. Crawford's 
letter to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">Mr. Forsyth</a> had been placed by the latter in your hands, without 
any previous act or agency on your part; but, by Mr. Forsyth's letter to me, 
I am informed that such is not the fact. It seems that he acted as your 
agent in the affair. He states that you applied to him to be informed of 
what took place in the cabinet of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Monroe</a> on the subject of the Seminole campaign." In my letter to Mr. Forsyth, I use almost verbatim the 
.same language. As far as I am capable of understanding the force of words, 
my language does not vary, in the smallest degree, in its sense, from that 
used by Mr. Forsyth in his letter to me, and most certainly does not more 
strongly imply than his does that you applied to him personally for the information. But, suppose I had fallen into the "gross errors" of inferring 
from Mr. Forsyth's letter that you had personally applied to him, when, in 
fact, it was not you, but your agent, James Hamilton, (of New York,) who applied for you in your name^s Mr. Forsyth informed youin his letter of 17th 
June, it requires more penetration than I possess to discover how the difference can, in the slightest degree, affect the only material question, whether he 
acted as a mere volunteer, or as your agent. Mr. Forsyth himself decides 
this question. He tells you expressly, that he did not act as a volunteer; and 
it is on the ground that he acted for you, and not for himself, that I claimed 
of you to be put in possession of certain facts connected with the subject of 
our correspondence, which were in the possession of Mr. Forsyth, and 
which I deemed important to the full development of this affair; but, instead of complying with so reasonable a request, you reply, not by denying 
the justice of the request, nor that he acted for you, and not for himself 
but by accusing nie of " gross errors," an assumption on your part at onjae 
fratuitous and immaterial, that I had inferred that you had applied to Mr. Forsyth personally, when, in fact, the application had been made for you,. 
In your own name, by Mr. Hamilton. I must say, that I cannot see in 
your statement the least excuse for withholding from me the information 
requested; and I am constrained to add, that I have looked in vain in the 
course which you have pursued for the evidence of that frankness which 
you assured me, in submitting the copy of Mr Crawford's letter to me, has 
ever characterised your conduct towards those with whom you had been in 
habits of friendship. As connected with this point, let me call your attention to a fact which has not been explained, though in my opinion it ought 
to be. It now appears, that when Mr. Forsyth placed the copy of Mr. 
Crawford's letter in your hands, lie also placed with it a copy of his letter 
referred to by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>. Why was it that a copy of this letter of 
Mr. Forsyth did not accompany Mr. Crawford s, when you placed a copy 
of the letter in my hands? Calling upon me in the spirit of frankness and 
friendship, as you informed me you did, I had a right to infer that every 
document connected with the charge, and in your possession, calculated to 
afford light, would be placed in my possession; and such, in fact, was my 
impression, but which I now find to be erroneous. It is with regret that 
I feel myself bound to state that Mr. Forsyth's letter, with the subsequent 
correspondence, has given an aspect to the affair very different from what, 
I received from your first letter. 
</p><p>
You have stated some suggestions of the Marshal of the District, which 
were communicated to you, as the reason why you have agitated this old 
affair at this time. You have not stated what they were, to whom made, 
or by whom communicated, which, of course, leaves me in the dark as to 
their nature or character. But whatever they may be, the course you adopted, considering the friendly relation which I had reason to suppose existed 
between us, is well calculated to excite surprise. Instead of applying to the 
Marshal, in order to ascertain what he did say, and from whom he derived 
his information, and then submitting his statement to me, which course 
friendship, and the high opinion which you say you entertained for my 
character "for fair, open, and honorable conduct in all things," manifestly 
dictated, you applied for information, as to my conduct, to the man who, 
you knew, felt towards me the strongest enmity. I wish not to be understood that you had mere general information of his ill-will towards me. 
Your information was of the most specific character, and was of such a nature as ought to have made you distrust any statement of his, calculated tr? 
affect my reputation. 
</p><p>
Knowing the political machinations that were carrying on against me, 
and wishing to place me on my guard, a friend of mine placed in my hands, 
some time since, a copy of a letter written by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a> to a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a> 
correspondent of his in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1827">1827</a>. It constitutes one of the many means resorted to in order to excite your suspicion against me. In it Mr. Crawford makes an abusive attack upon me; but, not content with thus assailing 
my character in the dark, he offers to bring into the market the influence 
which Georgia might have on the presidential election, as a means whereby 
to depress my political prospects. To avoid the possibility of mistakes, I 
will give extracts from the letter itself, in full confirmation of what I have stated. 
</p><p>
Speaking of the presidential election, Mr. Crawford says that, "the only 
difficulty that this State (Georgia) has upon the subject, (your election;) is 
that, if Jackson should be elected, Calhoun will come into power. " 
</p><p>
Again : 
</p><p>
"If you can ascertain that Calhoun will not be benefitted by Jackson's 
election, you will do him a benefit by communicating the information to 
me. Make what use you please of this letter, and show it to whom you 
please. " 
</p><p>
That the letter was clearly intended for your inspection, cannot be doubted. The authority to his correspondent to make what -use he pleased, and 
to show it to whom he pleased, with the nature of the information sought, 
whether I was to be benefitted by your election, which could only be derived from yourself) leaves no doubt on that point; and I am accordingly 
informed that you saw the letter. 
</p><p>
A proposition of the kind, at that particular period, when the presidential 
election was most doubtful, and most warmly contested, needs no comment 
as to its object. To say nothing of its moral and political character, stronger 
proof could not be offered of the deepest enmity towards me on the part of 
the writer, which at least ought to have placed you on your guard against all 
attacks on me from that quarter. The letter will not be denied; but if, 
contrary to expectation, it should, I stand ready, by highly respectable authority, to maintain its authenticity. 
</p><p>
You well know the disinterested, open, and fearless course which myself 
and my friends were pursuing at this very period, and the weight of enmity 
which it drew down upon us from your opponents. Little did I then suspect that these secret machinations were carrying on against me at Nashville, or that such propositions could be ventured to be made to you, or, if 
ventured, without being instantly disclosed to me. Of this, however, I 
complain not, nor do I intend to recriminate; but I must repeat the expression 
of my surprise, that you should apply to an individual who you knew, from 
such decisive proof, to be actuated by the most inveterate hostility towards 
me, for information of my course in Mr. Monroe's cabinet. It affords to 
my mind conclusive proof that you had permitted your feelings to be alienated bv the artful movements of those who have made you the victim of 
their intrigue, long before the commencement of this correspondence. 
</p><p>
Instead of furnishing me with the information which I claimed, in order 
io a fall understanding of this extraordinary affair, and which you could not 
justly withhold, you kindly undertake to excuse the individual to whom you supposed some allusion ol mine to be made. I know not to whom you 
refer. I made no allusion to any one particular individual. But, be that 
as it may, you must excuse me if, on subjects which concern me, I should 
prefer my judgment to yours, and, of course, if I should not be satisfied with 
your opinion, as a substitute for the facts by which I might be able to form my own. 
</p><p>
After I had so fully demonstrated the candor and sincerity with which I 
have acted throughout this affair, I did not suppose that you would reiterate 
your former charges; but having done so, it only remains for me to repeat, 
in the most positive manner, the contradiction. I never for a moment disguised my sentiment on this or any other political subject. Why should I 
in this instance? I had violated no duty no rule of honor, nor obligation 
of friendship. I did your motives full justice in every stage of the cabinet 
deliberation, and, after a full investigation, I entirely approved and heartily 
supported the final decision. In this course I was guided, it is true, not by 
icelings of friendship, but solely by a sense of duty. When our country 
is concerned, there ought to be room neither for friendship nor enmity. 
</p><p>
You conclude your letter by saying that you understand the matter now, 
that you feel no interest in this altercation, and that you would leave me and 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>, and all concerned, to settle this affair in our own way, and 
that you now close the correspondence for ever. 
</p><p>
It is not for me to object to the manner you may choose to close the 
correspondence on your part. On my part, I have no desire to prolong 
it The spectacle of the first and second officers of this great republic engaged in a correspondence of this nature, has no attraction for me at any 
time, and is very far from being agreeable at this critical juncture of our 
affairs. My consolation is, that it was not of my seeking; and, as I am not 
responsible for its commencement, I feel no disposition to incur any responsibility for its continuance. Forced into it, to repel unjust and base imputations upon my character, I could not retire in honor while they continued 
to be reiterated. 
</p><p>
Having now fully vindicated my conduct, I will conclude the correspondence also, with a single remark, that I too well know what is due to 
my rights and self icspect, in this unpleasant affair, to permit myself to be 
diverted into an altercation with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=whc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crawford</a>, or any other individual, 
whom you may choose to consider as concerned in this affair.
