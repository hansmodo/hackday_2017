[To the President of the Council of Safety]
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I left Fort Edward with <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='met colleague'>General Schuyler</a> at noon, and 
shall return thither some time tomorrow morning. Fort 
George was destroyed yesterday afternoon, previous to which 
the provisions, stores, and batteaux, were removed, and this 
morning about ten o'clock the last of them passed us about 
three miles to the northward of Fort Edward, at which place 
all the troops from the Lake are arrived, and they, together 
with some others, form an advanced post towards Fort George. 
About twelve hundred, perhaps more, are somewhat farther 
advanced upon the road to Fort Anne.

The enemy have not yet made any motion that we know of, nor indeed can they make any of consequence, until they 
shall have procured carriages, and then they may find it rather 
difficult to come this way, if proper care be taken to prevent 
them from procuring forage. For this purpose I shall give it 
as my opinion to the General, whenever he asks it, to break 
up all the settlements. upon our northern frontier, to drive off 
the cattle, secure or destroy the forage, and also to destroy the 
sawmills. These measures, harsh as they may seem, are I 
am confident absolutely necessary. They ought undoubtedly to be taken with prudence, and temperately carried into 
execution : but I will venture to say, that if we lay it down as 
a maxim, never to contend for ground but in the last necessity, 
and to leave nothing but a wilderness to the enemy, their progress must be impeded by obstacles, which it is not in human 
nature to surmount ; and then, unless we have, with our usual 
good nature, built posts for their defence, they must at the approach of winter retire to the place, from whence they first set 
out. The militia from the eastward come in by degrees, and 
I expect we shall soon be in force to carry on the petite guerre 
to advantage, provided always <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Burgoyne</a> attempts to annoy us, 
for it is pretty clear that we cannot get at him. I am, &,c.
