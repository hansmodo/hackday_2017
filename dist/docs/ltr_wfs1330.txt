HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a>, April 23, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>. 
<p></p>
SIR: 
<p></p>
In forwarding the reports of commanders which 
detail the operations of their several corps against the 
Mexican lines at Cerro Gordo, I shall present, in continuation of my former report, but an outline of the 
affair, and while adopting heartily their commendations of the ardor and efficiency of individuals, I shall 
mention by name only those who figure prominently. 
or, from position, could not be included in those subreports. 
<p></p>
The field sketch herewith, indicates the positions 
of the two armies. The tierra caUente, or low level, 
terminates at Plan del JRio, the site of the American 
camp, from which the road ascends immediately in a 
long circuit among lofty hills, whose commanding 
points had all been fortified and garrisoned by the 
enemy. His right, intrenched, rested on a precipice 
overhanging an impassable ravine that forms the bed 
of the stream; and his intreiichments extended continuously to the road, on which was placed a formida 
ble battery. On the other side, the lofty and difficult 
height of Cerro Gordo commanded the approaches in 
all directions. The main body of the Mexican army 
was encamped on level ground, with a battery of five 
pieces, half a mile in rear of that height toward <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a>. 
<p></p>
Resolving, if possible, to turn the enemy's left, and 
attack in rear, while menacing or engaging his front, I 
caused daily reconnaissances to be pushed, with the 
view of finding a route for a force to debouch on the 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a> road and cut off retreat. 
<p></p>
The reconnaissance begun by Lieutenant Beauregard, was continued by Captain Lee, Engineers, and a 
road made along difficult slopes and over chasms out 
of the enemy's view, though reached by his fire when 
discovered until, arriving at the Mexican lines, farther 
reconnaissance became impossible without an action. 
The desired point of debouchure, the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a> road, was 
not therefore reached, though believed to be within 
easy distance ; and to gain that point, it now became 
necessary to carry the height of Cerro Gordo. The 
dispositions in my plan of battle general orders No. 
Ill, heretofore enclosed were accordingly made. 
<p></p>
Twiggs s division, reenforced by Shields s brigade of 
volunteers, was thrown into position on the 17th, and 
was, of necessity, drawn into action in taking up the 
ground for its bivouac and the opposing height for 
our heavy battery. It will be seen that many of our 
officers and men were killed or wounded in this sharp 
combat handsomely commenced by a company of the 
7th Infantry under Brevet First Lieutenant Gardner, 
who is highly praised by all his commanders for signal 
services. Colonel Harney coming up with the rifle 
regiment and 1st Artillery (also parts of his brigade) 
brushed away the enemy and occupied the height on 
which, in the night, was placed a battery of one 24-pounder and two 24-pound howitzers, under the super-intendence of Captain Lee, Engineers, and Lieutenant 
Hagner, Ordnance. These guns opened next morning, 
and were served with effect by Captain Steptoe and 
Lieutenant Brown, 3d Artillery, Lieutenant Hagner 
(Ordnance), and Lieutenant Seymour, 1st Artillery. 
<p></p>
The same night, with extreme toil and difficulty, 
under the superintendence of Lieutenant Tower, Engineer, and Lieutenant Laidley, Ordnance, an eight-inch 
howitzer was put in position across the river and opposite to the enemy's right battery. A detachment of 
four companies, under Major Burnham, New York Volunteers, performed this creditable service, which enabled 
Lieutenant Ripley, 2d Artillery, in charge of the piece, 
to open a timely fire in that quarter. 
<p></p>
Early on the 18th, the columns moved to the general attack, and our success was speedy and decisive. 
Pillow's brigade, assaulting the right of the intrenchments, although compelled to retire, had the effect I 
have heretofore stated. Twiggs's division, storming 
the strong and vital point of Cerro Gordo, pierced the 
centre, gained command of all of the intrenchments, 
and cut them off from support. As our infantry 
(Colonel Eiley s brigade) pushed on against the main 
body of the enemy, the guns of their own fort were 
rapidly turned to play on that force (under the immediate command of General Santa Anna), who fled in 
confusion. Shields s brigade, bravely assaulting the 
left, carried the rear battery (five guns) on the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a> 
road, and aided materially in completing the rout of 
the enemy. 
<p></p>
The part taken by the remainder of our forces, held 
in reserve to support and pursue, has already been 
noticed. 
<p></p>
The moment the fate of the day was decided, the 
cavalry, and Taylor's, and Wall's field batteries were 
pushed on toward <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a> in advance of the pursuing 
columns of infantry Twiggs's division and the Brigade 
of Shields (now under Colonel Baker) and Major-General Patterson was sent to take command of them. 
In the hot pursuit many Mexicans were captured or 
slain before our men and horses were exhausted by the 
heat and distance. 
<p></p>
The rout proves to have been complete the retreat 
ing army, except a small body of cavalry, being dispersed and utterly disorganized. The immediate con 
sequences have been our possession of this important 
city, the abandonment of the works and artillery at La Hoya, the next formidable pass between <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a> and 
the capital, and the prompt occupation by Worth's 
division of the fortress of Perote (second only to San Juan de Ulloa), with its extensive armament of sixty- 
six guns and mortars, and its large supplies of materiel. 
To General "Worth's report, annexed, I refer for details. 
<p></p>
I have heretofore endeavored to do justice to the 
skill and courage with which the attack on the height 
of Cerro Gordo was directed and executed, naming the 
regiments most distinguished, and their commanders, 
under the lead of Colonel Harney. Lieutenant G. W. 
Smith led the engineer company as part of the storming force, and is noticed with distinction. 
<p></p>
The reports of this assault make favorable mention 
of many in which I can well concur, having witnessed 
the daring advance and perfect steadiness of the whole. 
Beside those already named, Lieutenant Brooks, 3d 
Infantry ; Lieutenant Macdonald, 2d Dragoons ; Lieutenant Yandorn, 7th Infantry all acting staff officers 
Captain Magruder, 1st Artillery, and Lieutenant 
Gardner, 7th Infantry, seem to havt, won especial 
praise. 
<p></p>
Colonel Eiley s brigade and Talcott's rocket and 
howitzer battery, were engaged on and about the 
heights, and bore an active part. 
<p></p>
The brigade so gallantly led by General Shields, 
and, after his fall, by Colonel Baker, deserves high 
commendation for its fine behavior and success. Colonels Foreman and Burnett, and Major Harris, commanded the regiments ; Lieutenant Hammond, 3d 
Artillery, and Lieutenant Davis, Illinois Volunteers, 
constituted the brigade staff. These operations, hid 
from my view by intervening hills, were not fully 
known when my first report was hastily written. 
<p></p>
Brigadier-General Twiggs, who was in the immediate command of all the advanced forces, has earned 
high credit by his judgment, spirit, and energy. 
<p></p>
The conduct of Colonels Campbell, Haskell, and 
"Wynkoop, commanding the regiments of Pillow's brigade, is reported in terms of strong approbation by 
Major-General Patterson. I recommend for a commission, Quartermaster-Sergeant Henry, of the 7th 
Infantry (already known to the army for intrepidity 
on former occasions), who hauled down the national 
standard of the Mexican fort. 
<p></p>
In expressing my indebtedness for able assistance 
to Lieutenant-Colonel Hitchcock, Acting Inspector-General, to Majors Smith and Turnbull, the respective 
Chiefs of Engineers and Topographical Engineers 
to their Assistants, Lieutenants Mason, Beauregard, 
Stevens, Tower, G. W. Smith, McClellan, Engineers, 
and Lieutenants Derby and Hardcastle, Topographical 
Engineers to Captain Allen, Chief Quartermaster, 
and Lieutenant Blair, Chief Commissary and to Lieutenants Hagner and Laidley, Ordnance all actively 
employed I am compelled to make special mention 
of the services of Captain R. E. Lee, Engineer. This 
officer, greatly distinguished at the siege of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a>, 
was again indefatigable, during these operations, in 
reconnaissances as daring as laborious, and of the utmost 
value. Nor was he less conspicuous in planting batteries, and in conducting columns to their stations un 
der the heavy fire of the enemy. 
<p></p>
My personal staff, Lieutenants Scott, Williams, and 
Lay, and Major Yan Buren, w r ho volunteered for the 
occasion, gave me zealous and efficient assistance. 
<p></p>
Our whole force present, in action and in reserve, 
was eight thousand five hundred ; the enemy is estimated at twelve thousand, or more. About three thou 
sand prisoners, four or five thousand stands of arms, 
and forty-three pieces of artillery were taken. By the 
accompanying return, I regret to find our loss more 
severe than at first supposed, amounting in the two 
days to thirty-three officers and three hundred and 
ninety-eight men in all four hundred and thirty-one, 
of whom sixty-three were killed. The enemy's loss is 
computed to be from one thousand to one thousand 
two hundred. 
<p></p>
I am happy in communicating strong hopes of the 
recovery of the gallant General Shields, who is so much 
improved as to have been brought to this place. 
<p></p>

<p></p>
