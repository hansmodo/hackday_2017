Dear Brother: We have nearly completed the circle 
without finding Juarez, who is about as far as ever, away 
up in Chihuahua for no other possible purpose than to 
be where the devil himself cannot get at him. 
</p><p>
I have not the remotest idea of riding on mule back a 
thousand miles in Mexico to find its chief magistrate, 
and although the French go away and Maximilian follow, I doubt if Juarez can be made to trust his life and 
safety to his own countrymen. We found Vera Cruz in 
possession of the French and Maximilian, and we found 
Tucapiso in possession of local troops in the interest of 
Maximilian, but they had not the remotest idea where 
we should look for Juarez. We have just reached here, 
and shall to-morrow go up to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a> to meet General Escobedo, who can possibly fix some date when 
Juarez will come within reach of civilization. 
</p><p>
The truth is these Mexicans were and are still as unable as children to appreciate the value of time. They 
shrug their shoulders and exclaim " Quien sabe ! " (who 
knows) and "Poco tiempo" (in a short time), utterly 
regardless of combinations with others. 
</p><p>
Mr. Campbell can deal with none but Juarez and the 
Eepublican Government he represents, and that government partakes of the characteristics of Mexicans; viz., 
indecision and utter want of combination. 
</p><p>
I believe the French want to leave, but would like to 
bring us into the scrape. Their scheme of giving Mexico 
a stable government has cost them $ 200,000,000 of gold, 
and the whole conception was in hostility to us, to be 
ready to reabsolve the old Louisiana purchase, where, as 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=napoleon" rel="city">Napoleon</a> calculated, our Union had failed. But our 
Union has not failed, and the French are willing to go, 
but they are scattered and must collect before they can 
march for the seacoast to embark. By reason of the 
everlasting contest between the rival factions of Mexico, 
the property-holders desire some sort of stable government, and these favor Maximilian. He may attempt to 
remain after the French go, but I think would soon be 
forced to go. Then Mexico must of necessity settle her 
own difficulties. Some think she can, some that she 
cannot without our aid. This cannot be done without 
Congress, and on that point I am no advocate. All I 
can say is that Mexico does not belong to our system. 
All its northern part is very barren and costly. Its 
southern part is very good tropical country, but not suited 
to our people or pursuits. Its inhabitants are a mixture 
of Indians, negroes, and Spanish, that can never be tortured into good citizens, and would have to be exterminated before the country could be made available to us. 
I am obeying orders and not carrying out a project of my 
own, and it is well you should understand it, though I 
cannot impart it to others. 
</p><p>
I don't know what policy the Administration has 
adopted, but I should deplore anything that would make 
us assume Mexico in any shape its territory, its government, or its people. Still the French occupation 
designed in hostility to us should be made to terminate. 
</p><p>
Affectionately,
