My Dear Sister,
</p><p>
Our spring is opening beautifully, though it is said to be late. I wish that I could only be with you this evening, ah! Not this evening only, but many evenings. I am invited to a large party to night and among the scramble, expect to come in for my share of fun. My health is still improving and in a few months through the blessing of an all kind providence, I hope to be well, at least so much as people usually are.
</p><p>
I wish that you would send me by the return mail the daguerreotype which I had taken in New York after having shaved. The one with the beard on, was taken at New Orleans soon after my return from Mexico. This last one I wish you to keep safely as I prize it highly. If you remember, I gave you two others one being taken with a stern countenance, and the other with a smile, it is the smiling one which I want and don't fail to send it well enveloped, by the first mail. If you wish it to be returned, I will try and do so in a few months or else a better one in its stead; as I think your brother is a better looking man than he was when that was taken. It may be that you have not got the one which I had taken with the beard on, if not it is lost. I am anxious to get Father's, in order to have a facsimile of it taken, but do not trust it to the mail. I believe you let Cousin Harriet have the grim looking one, which I gave you, ungrateful girl that she is. I am going to write to her in a few days such a letter as such conduct in a pretty cousin merits.
</p><p>
I hope that you are out of bed, and able to enjoy the comforts of domestic life. Kiss the children and tell them a great many things such as their uncle would tell him were he in their company.
</p><p>
Remember me very kindly to Mr. A. and to all the family and to all enquiring relatives & friends. Should any person be coming here, I would be glad to get my Blair's Rhetoric.
</p><p>
Your brother, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jjt" rel="me">Thomas</a>
