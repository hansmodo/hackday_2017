<a rel='month origin' value='8'>August</a> <a rel='day origin' value='14'>14th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. We have conflicting testimony. Young Wade Hampton, of <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston's</a> staff, says <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> lost 
12,000 men in the battles of the 22d x and 24th, but Brewster, of <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood's</a> staff, says not three thousand at the utmost. 
Now here are two people strictly truthful, who tell things so differently. In this war people see the same things so 
oddly one does not know what to believe.

Brewster says when he was in Richmond <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis</a> said <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Johnston</a> would have to be removed and <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a> blocked. 
He could not make Hardee full general because, when he had command of an army he was always importuning the 
War Department for a general-in-chief to be sent there over him. Polk would not do, brave soldier and patriot as 
he was. He was a good soldier, and would do his best for his country, and do his duty under whomever was put over 
him by those in authority. <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis</a> did not once intimate to him who it was that he intended to promote to the head of the Western Army. 
</p><p>
Brewster said to-day that this " blow at <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston</a>, cutting off his head, ruins the schemes of the enemies of the 
government. Wigf all asked me to go at once, and get <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> to decline to take this command, for it will destroy him if 
he accepts it. He will have to fight under Jeff Davis's orders ; no one can do that now and not lose caste in the Western Army. <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston</a> does not exactly say that Jeff Davis betrays his plans to the enemy, but he says he dares 
not let the President know his plans, as there is a spy in the 
War Office who invariably warns the Yankees in time. consulting the government on military movements is played out. That's Wigf all's way of talking. Now," added Brewster, " I blame the President for keeping a man at 
the head of his armies who treats the government with open scorn and contumely, no matter how the people at 
large rate this disrespectful general.
