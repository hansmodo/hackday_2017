My good Friend, 
</p><p>
It gives me pleasure to learn from my son, that, in a 
letter lately received by your nephew, you made inquiries 
respecting me. 
</p><p>
We have both experienced afflicting dispensations. Your 
portion of health has for a long time been diminished ; and 
I have not had a well day for the last twelve years. You 
have been deprived of an excellent brother, who was an 
excellent man ; and I of several relations, and particularly 
of an amiable and affectionate daughter. It is a comfort to 
hope and believe, that such dispensations answer merciful 
purposes, and that the time will come when we shall rejoice 
in having been reminded by adversity, that temporal enjoyments are transient. 
</p><p>
The winter having been more cold than common, has 
confined me to the house during the course of it ; and the 
weather this spring has not yet so mild as to admit of 
</p><p>
my going abroad without risk. x'Uthough my old complaint 
has gradually reduced me to a state of incurable debility, yet 
I seldom suffer from acute pain, except occasionally from 
rheumatism. In various respects, I have abundant reason 
to be thankful. 
</p><p>
We have both passed the usual term of human life, or 
(as the lawyers say) our leases have expired, and we are 
now holding over. To be thus circumstanced, is not very 
important to those who expect to remove from their present 
abodes to better habitations, and to enjoy them in perpetuity. That we may both be, and continue to be, numbered with these, is the sincere desire of 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend, 
</p><p>
