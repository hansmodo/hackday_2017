DEAR SIR, Some business, the need of exercise after a very 
sedentary period, and the view of extending my ramble into the 
Eastern States, which I have long had a curiosity to see, have 
brought me to this place. ****** At <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> 
I fell in with the Marquis de la Fayette, returning from a visit 
to Mount Vernon. Wherever he passes he receives the most 
flattering tokens of sincere affection from all ranks. He did 
not propose to have left Virginia so soon, but <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">General Washington</a> was about setting out on a trip to the Ohio, and could 
not then accompany him on some visits, as he wished to do. 
The present plan of the Marquis is to proceed immediately to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>; thence, by Rhode Island, to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>; thence thro' 
Albany to Fort Schuyler, where a treaty with the Indians is to 
be held the latter end of this month; thence to Virginia, so as 
to meet the Legislature at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">RICHMOND</a>. I have some ' thoughts 
of making this tour with him, but suspend my final resolution 
till I get to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, whither I shall follow him in a day or 
two. 
</p><p>
The relation in which the Marquis stands to France and 
America has induced me to enter into a free conversation with 
him on the subject of the Mississippi. I have endeavored emphatically to impress on him that the ideas of America and of 
Spain irreconcileably clash; that unless the mediation of France 
be effectually exerted, an actual rupture is near at hand; that 
in such an event, the connection between France and Spain will 
give the enemies of the former in America the fairest opportunity of involving her in our resentments against the latter, and 
of introducing Great Britain as a party with us against both; 
that America cannot possibly be diverted from her object, and 
therefore France is bound to set every engine at work to divert 
Spain from hers; and that France has, besides, a great interest 
in a trade with the western country through the Mississippi. 
</p><p>
I thought it not amiss, also, to suggest to him some of the considerations which seem to appeal to the prudence of Spain. He 
admitted the force of everything I said; told me he would write 
in the most [favorable] terms to the Count de Vergennes by the 
packet which will probably carry this, and let me see his letter 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> before he sends it. He thinks that Spain is bent 
on excluding us from the Mississippi, and mentioned several 
anecdotes which happened while he was at Madrid in proof 
of it. 
</p><p>
The Committee of the States have dispersed. Several of the 
Eastern members having, by quitting it, reduced the number 
below a quorum, the impotent remnant thought it needless to 
keep together. It is not probable they will be reassembled before November, so that there will be an entire interregnum of 
the federal Government for some time, against the intention of 
Congress I apprehend, as well as against every rule of decorum. 
</p><p>
The Marquis this moment stepped into my room, and, seeing 
my cyphers before me, dropped some questions which obliged 
me, in order to avoid reserv. to let him know that I was writing to you. I said nothing of the subject, but he will probably 
infer from our conversation that the Mississippi is most in my 
thoughts. 
</p><p>
Mrs. House charges me with a thousand compliments and 
kind wishes for you and Miss Patsy. We hear nothing of 
Mrs. Trist, since her arrival at the Falls of the Ohio, on her 
way to N. Orleans. There is no doubt that she proceeded 
down the river thence, unapprized of her loss. When and how 
she will be able to get back, since the Spaniards have shut all 
their ports against the U. S., is uncertain, and gives much 
anxiety to her friends. Browse has a windfall from his grandmother of XI, 000 sterling. 
</p><p>
Present my regards to Miss Patsy and to Mr. Short, if he 
should be with you, and accept yourself, Dear Sir, the sincerest 
affection of 
</p><p>
Your friend and serv.t.
