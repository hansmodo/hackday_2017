The next letter, written a month later, is also to <a href="results.php?tla=oxc" rel="sibling met">Orion</a> Clemens, who had
now moved to Muscatine, Iowa, and established there a new paper with an
old title, 'The Journal'.

<p>To <a href="results.php?tla=oxc" rel="sibling met">Orion</a> Clemens, in Muscatine, Iowa:</p>

<p>PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 28th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1853">1853</a>.</p>

<p>The printers' annual ball and supper came off the other night.  The
proceeds amounted to about $1,000.  The printers, as well as other
people, are endeavoring to raise money to erect a monument to Franklin,
but there are so many abominable foreigners here (and among printers,
too,) who hate everything American, that I am very certain as much money
for such a purpose could be raised in St. Louis, as in Philadelphia.
I was in Franklin's old office this morning--the "North American"
(formerly "Philadelphia Gazette") and there was at least one foreigner
for every American at work there.</p>

<p>How many subscribers has the Journal got?  What does the job-work pay?
and what does the whole concern pay?.....</p>

<p>I will try to write for the paper occasionally, but I fear my letters
will be very uninteresting, for this incessant night-work dulls one's
ideas amazingly.</p>

<p>From some cause, I cannot set type nearly so fast as when I was at home.
Sunday is a long day, and while others set 12 and 15,000, yesterday, I
only set 10,000.  However, I will shake this laziness off, soon, I reckon
....</p>

<p>How do you like "free-soil?"--I would like amazingly to see a good
old-fashioned negro.</p>

My love to all<br/>                                   
Truly your brother<br/>
