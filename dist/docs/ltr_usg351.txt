MY DEAR MR. CORBIN:
</p><p>
We arrived here from the Continent yesterday, and found awaiting us
your very acceptable letter. On Wednesday we start again to visit
Scotland where I have had many invitations from both corporations and
from private gentlemen. We will take about three weeks for this trip,
after which we will visit some portions of England not yet visited, and
Nellie at her home, and get to Paris the latter part of October. The
papers no doubt will keep you advised of our movements in advance of
anything I could write to go by mail. Our visit has been most agreeable
in every particular. People everywhere, both travellers and residents,
did all they could to make everything pleasant for us. How long we will
remain abroad is not yet determined, but I think for two years yet if
the means to do so hold out.
</p><p>
During my visit to the Continent I saw but few American papers so that
I am now somewhat behind in information as to what has been going on in
the United States. All the foreign papers however have been full of the
great strike which has taken place on our roads. It must have been
serious but probably not so serious as it seemed at a distance. My
judgment is that it should have been put down with a strong hand and so
summarily as to prevent a like occurrence for a generation.
</p><p>
We have made a short visit to Nellie at her home. She lives in a
delightful part of the country.
</p><p>
All join me in love to Mother and Jennie as well as yourself. I will be
glad to hear from you as often as you may feel like writing.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.

We met Mrs. Clark and Roberts in Switzerland. It was like being back
home to meet old acquaintances. Except Senator Conkling and some of our
Government officials they are the only Americans I have met that I felt
I knew very well. Please remember me to Senator Frelinghuysen and such
other friends as you meet.
