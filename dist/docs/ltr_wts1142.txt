Dear Brother : I embarked to-day on the Forest Queen 
and will have 20,000 men in boats by noon and be off 
for the real South. At Helena I will get about 12,000 
more. Like most of our boasts of the " Myriads of the 
northwest sweeping away to the Gulf," "breaking the 
back bone," &c. &c., the great Mississippi expedition 
will be 32,000 men. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> is well fortified and is 
within telegraphic and railroad reach of Meridian, Mobile, 
Camp Moore and Grenada, where Pemberton has 30,000 
to 35,000 men. Therefore don't expect me to achieve 
miracles. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> is not the only thing to be done. 
Grant is at Coffeeville! (?) with say 40,000 men. He 
expected me to have the same but they are not here. 
We can get the Yazoo, can front in any and every direction and can take <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>, clean out the Yazoo, capture 
or destroy the fleet of enemy's gunboats and transports 
concealed up about Yazoo city and do many other useful things. Blair is down at Helena and will doubtless 
form a part of the expedition. He will have a chance 
of catching the Elephant by the tail and get a good lift. 
</p><p>
Of course the pressure of this force acting in concert 
with Grant must produce good results. Even if we don't 
open the Mississippi, by the way an event not so important as at first sight, until the great armies of the enemy 
are defeated we are progressing. I wish <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aeb" rel="colleague met">Burnside</a> and 
Kosecrans were getting along faster, but I suppose they 
encounter the same troubles we all do. . . .

The great evil is absenteeism, which is real desertion 
and should be punished with death. Of course I would 
have the wounded and sick well cared for, but the sick 
list real and feigned is fearful. More than one-half the 
paper army is not in the enemy's country and whilst the 
actual regiments present for duty are in arrears of pay 
and favor, sick and discharged men are carefully paid 
and provided for. Unite with others and discriminate 
in favor of the officers and soldiers who are with their 
companies. The " absent and sick " should receive half 
pay because of the advantages they receive of fine hospitals and quiet residence at home. The " absent without leave " should be treated as deserters and in no event 
receive a dollar's pay clothing or anything else. In 
course of time we may get an army. Finance is very 
important but no use of discussing that now; we must 
fight it out if it devastates the land and costs every 
cent of the North. . . . 
</p><p>
I rise at 3 A.M. to finish up necessary business and as 
usual write in haste. ... I am very popular with the 
people here and officers and indeed with all my men. I 
don't seek popularity with the " sneaks and absentees " 
or the " Dear People." . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately,
