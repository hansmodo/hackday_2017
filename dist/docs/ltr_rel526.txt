I have just returned from Charleston, and received your letter of
the 14th, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse sweetheart met">Mary</a>....  I was called to Charleston by the appearance
off the bar of a fleet of vessels the true character and intent of
which could not be discerned during the continuance of the storm which
obscured the view.  Saturday, however, all doubt was dispelled, and
from the beach on Sullivan's Island the preparations for sinking them
were plainly seen.  Twenty-one were visible the first day of my arrival,
but at the end of the storm, Saturday, only seventeen were seen.  Five
of these were vessels of war:  what became of the other four is not
known.  The twelve old merchantmen were being stripped of their spars,
masts, etc., and by sunset seven were prepared apparently for sinking
across the mouth of the Maffitt Channel.  they were placed in a line
about two hundred yards apart, about four miles from Fort Moultrie.
They will do but little harm to the channel, I think, but may deter
vessels from running out at night for fear of getting on them.  There
now seem to be indications of a movement against Savannah.  The enemy's
gunboats are pushing up the creek to cut off communication between
the city and Fort Pulaski on Cockspur Island.  Unless I have better
news, I must go there to-day.  There are so many points of attack,
and so little means to meet them on the water, that there is but little
rest....  Perry and Meredith are well and send regards to everybody....

                 Very truly and sincerely yours,
