GENTLEMEN : 
</p><p>
Since my last I have had the pleasure of receiving your 
reply to my two favours of 29th ultimo and 2d current. I 
am happy enough to be able to inform you, that my indisposition, which was the occasion of my brevity when I last 
wrote, is now removed. 
</p><p>
The opinion I advanced respecting the enemy's not moving before the beginning of May, seems to be shaken, though 
not entirely overthrown, by some present appearances. We 
have received information, that they are embarking about 
three thousand men on board of transports, which are lying 
at the Hook, by way of Staten Island. This, it is conjectured, is with a view to the Delaware ; and the supposition 
is confirmed, by the circumstance of a confederacy lately 
detected at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, who, among other things, were 
endeavouring, by the temptation of fifty pounds, to engage 
persons as pilots up that river. The extreme difficulties 
they must labour under for want of forage, and the infinite 
hazard they must run by moving with a small body of about 
five thousand men, with an enemy in the rear, incapable of 
sparing any considerable body of troops to form a post behind, and be an asylum to them in case of accident, these 
circumstances will hardly allow me to think they will be 
daring enough to make the attempt at this time. But on 
the other hand, as they know we are in a progressive state 
as to numbers, and other matters of importance, and as they 
have no prospect of early reinforcement, and are in a state 
of uncertainty as to any, from the bustling aspect of European affairs, it is probable they may conceive a necessity of 
making a push at all risks. Perhaps, however, this embarkation is intended for some other purpose ; to make a diversion, or execute some partizan exploit elsewhere. On 
the whole, I find it difficult to believe they are yet ready 
for any capital operation. 
</p><p>
As to your apprehensions of an attempt up the North 
river, I imagine you may discard any uneasiness on that 
score, although it will be at all times advisable to be on the 
watch against such a contingency, it is almost reduced to a certainty, that the principal views of the enemy in the ensuing 
campaign will be directed towards the southward, and to 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> more immediately ; of which idea, the discovery before mentioned, with respect to pilots, is no inconsiderable confirmation. <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> is an object calculated to strike and attract their attention. It has all along 
been the main source of supplies towards the war, and the 
getting it into their possession would deprive us of a wheel 
we could very badly spare, in the great political and military machine. They are sensible of this, and are equally 
sensible, that it contains in itself, and is surrounded by a 
prodigious number of persons attached to them, and inimical to us, who would lend them all the assistance they could 
in the further prosecution of their designs. It is also a 
common and well-grounded rule in war, to strike first and 
principally at the capital towns and cities, in order to the 
conquest of a country. 
</p><p>
I must confess I do not see any object equally interesting 
to draw then- efforts to the northward. Operations merely 
for plundering and devastation can never answer their end ; 
and if they could, one part of the continent would do nearly 
as well as another. And as to the notion of forming a 
junction with the northern army, and cutting off the communication between the northern and southern states, I 
apprehend it will do better in speculation than in practice. 
Unless the geography of the country is far different from 
any thing I can conceive, to effect this would require a 
chain of posts, and such a number of men at each, as would 
never be practicable or maintainable, but to an immense 
army. In their progress, by hanging upon their rear, and 
seizing every opportunity of skirmishing, their situation 
might be rendered insupportably uneasy. 
</p><p>
But for fear of mistake, the general has determined to 
collect a considerable body of troops at or about <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, 
which will not be drawn off till the intentions of the enemy 
have acquired a decisive complexion. These will be ready, according to conjunctures, either to proceed northerly or 
southerly, as may be requisite. Every precaution should 
be taken to prevent the boats from being destroyed, by collecting them at the first movement of the enemy under 
cover of one of the forts, or into some inlet, difficult of access and easily defensible with a small number of men. 
The loss of them would be an irreparable disadvantage. 
</p><p>
The enemy's attempt upon <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> is a demonstration 
of the folly of having any quantity of stores at places so 
near the water, and so much exposed to a sudden inroad. 
There should never be more there than sufficient to answer 
present demands. We have lost a good deal in this way at 
different" times, and I hope experience will at last make 
us wiser. 
</p><p>
His excellency lately had a visit from the Oneida chief 
and five others. He managed them with a good deal of 
address, and sent them away perfectly satisfied. He persuaded them to go to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, but they declined it, 
alleging their impatience to return, and remove the erroneous opinions of their countrymen, from the misrepresentations of British emissaries, which they were apprehensive 
might draw them into some rash proceedings. They parted, after having made the most solemn protestations of 
friendship and good will. His excellency has been very 
busy all day in despatching the southern post, which has 
prevented me giving him your resolve. It will, no doubt, 
be very acceptable ; and it is with pleasure I inform you, 
that the zeal and abilities of the New- York convention hold 
the first rank in his estimation. 
</p><p>
No news from France, save that the congress have obtained a credit there, for which they can draw bills to the 
amount of 100,000 sterling. This will be extremely serviceable in carrying on a trade with the French. The new 
troops begin to come in. If we can shortly get any considerable accession of strength, we may be able to strike 
some brilliant stroke. 
</p><p>
I am, Gentlemen, with the greatest respect, 
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">A. HAMILTON.</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. We have been some time endeavouring to negotiate a regular cartel ; but it has been lately broken off 
principally on account of Major General Lee. General 
Howe will not allow him to be comprehended under the 
general idea of American prisoners.
