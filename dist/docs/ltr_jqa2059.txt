TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
</p><p>
No. 24 [EDMUND RANDOLPH] 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR . THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, February 5, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
I have just returned from a visit to the citizen Paulus, 
President of the Assembly of Provisional Representatives of 
the people of Holland. 
</p><p>
By the notification, a copy of which was inclosed with my 
last letter, it will be observed that the President of the 
Assembly takes the place of the former Councillor Pensionary as to his relations with foreign Ministers. 
</p><p>
He spoke of the revolution which had just taken place 
and of the moderation and humanity, which had attended it. 
I observed that a revolution, conducted through with the 
same principles and conduct which had hitherto distinguished 
this, would exhibit an example worthy of admiration to all 
the nations of the earth. He replied that the national 
character, which was in general free from rashness and 
impetuosity, would still continue to direct a sober and 
regular conduct; that justice must have its claims, and the 
crimes which have for seven years oppressed and persecuted 
the Patriots of the country, will meet with punishment, 
though not with revenge. 
</p><p>
He said that under the alteration which had taken place 
he hoped there would be none unfavorable to the friendship 
subsisting between the two nations. That we were sister Republics, and as the number of such sisters is very small, 
they had a particular value for our friendship. That I 
should find among the persons now engaged in public affairs 
many who had been the most active in promoting the 
acknowledgment of our independence, and although they 
were now proceeding upon a system altogether different 
from that which they pursued at that time, yet their sentiments and dispositions towards us were still the same. 
That he had it expressly in charge from the Assembly to 
make me these assurances, and to add that they were resolved 
to perform l religiously the obligations of their treaties with 
the United States, and were disposed even to contract closer 
connections with them if they are so inclined. 
</p><p>
I told him that relative to circumstances which had so 
recently occurred, it was needless for me to observe that I 
could have no orders or instructions from the government 
of the United States to express their sentiments, but I could 
take upon myself to say, that the assurance of a continuation of the friendship and harmony subsisting between the 
two Republics would be received with great satisfaction, 
and would meet with the return of a similar disposition. 
</p><p>
As to the proposal of a closer connection I thought best not to appear to have noticed it. . . . 
</p><p>
The communication by the posts is opened anew with 
France, but has not yet become regular. All the other 
external posts are stopped, and the dearth of intelligence is 
consequently great. The operation of the late events here 
upon the policy of the belligerent powers is yet unknown, 
nor does it appear whether this Republic will yet be permitted to remain in peace. 
</p><p>
Should this be the case, undoubtedly the direct commerce 
of the United States to this country will become very advantageous, and will be more considerable than it has ever been 
hitherto. But in case of a new war it will depend much upon 
the policy pursued elsewhere. If our flag is respected, if 
the rights of our neutrality are not contested, and the practise of plundering one nation to starve another is disdained 
as an unworthy mode of warfare, our merchants will have 
great encouragement to pursue the commerce which is now 
opening here. I am unwilling to make a contrary supposition, but in case of necessity the proposal above related may 
deserve particular attention. . . .
