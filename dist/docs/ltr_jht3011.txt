SIR, 
</p><p>
I have received your two favors of the 24th and 
25th of July last. I have put Colonel Ward's regiment under marching orders, to proceed without loss 
of time, whatever way Congress shall direct. The 
troops from this State, destined to the northward, 
are marched to Bennington, and from thence to 
Skenesborough. At the request of <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a> 
for one thousand felling axes, I have sent eight hundred, ground and with helves, to go the same route. 
They went from hence the 29th last. The residue will go with clothing, preparing for that army, next Monday. I thought it not best to wait for orders, 
as we were very well assured of their necessity. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding our enemies are so numerous and powerful, and have hired mercenaries into their service, yet, knowing our cause righteous, and trusting 
Heaven will support and defend us, I do not greatly dread what they can do against us. Our internal 
malignants may be permitted to do many injurious 
and insidious things. They are, therefore, to be 
watched with care and diligence, to prevent such 
hypocritical and designing men carrying on and perpetrating their wicked purposes. No doubt there are 
many such, the persons and characters unknown to 
me ; and not convenient to mention in a letter the 
notices given me of any. 
</p><p>
Last week I sent circular letters addressed to the 
civil authority, Selectmen, Committees of Inspection, 
and Military Officers, in all the towns in this State, 
to promote and facilitate the filling the several battalions ordered to be raised here, and to send them 
forward to the places of their destination. Recruiting  officers for the companies not filled are necessary, and I conclude are left for the purpose. The 
people have, in some measure, got through the hurry 
of harvest, &c. Hope that they will now cheerfully 
enlist and go on. 
</p><p>
Colonel Dyer and Richard Law, Esq., are directed 
to repair to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to confer with your Excellency on every subject needful for our direction, and 
for your information. You know our readiness to 
afford every assistance for our common defence. I 
am, with great esteem and regard, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jht" rel="me">JONATHAN TRUMBULL</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Qthy 8 o clock, A. M. Just received your two favors of the 1st instant. Orders are gone to Colonel Elmore, and express to carry those to Colonel Ward expected in soon. The orders are ready.
