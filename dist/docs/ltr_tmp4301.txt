I have drawn up the inclosed with a design of 
presenting it to the Committee to whom a letter of 
mine to Congress was referred, and who have delivered in a report, as mentioned in my former letter 
to your Excellency. I have not read the narrative 
over, since I wrote it. A man's judgment in his own 
behalf, situated as I am, is very likely to he wrong, 
and between the apprehensions of saying too little or 
too much, he probably errs in both. 
</p><p>
What I can best say in favor of it is, that it is 
true, and contains matters which I wish Congress to 
know; and though there is an awkwardness in the 
information coming from me, yet, as it cannot come 
from anybody else, I feel an excuse to myself in 
doing it. I have shown it to no person whatever, 
nor mentioned it to any one except <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Robert Morris</a>, who advised the measure, and for that reason 
wished it to be done without his knowing any thing 
further of it. Therefore, as it is yet in embryo, 
should there be any thing in it that might be thought 
improper, I shall be much obliged to you to point it 
out to me. 
</p><p>
The case, as it appears to me, turns thus. If Congress and the country are disposed to make me any 
acknowledgments, it is right and necessary that they 
should know what the narrative mentions ; and if not, 
it will serve to exculpate me, in the opinion of future Congresses, from the implied demerit which the 
neglect of former ones serve to lay me under. And 
these are the points I chiefly had in view in drawing it up. Mr. Clarke, and Mr. Peters, who are of 
the Committee, were earnest with me to communicate 
myself to them freely ; and had proposed my meetr 
ing them on the Monday on which the alarm of the 
soldiers happened at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. This, of consequence, prevented it, and I then proposed doing it 
in writing; and, therefore, as I am under the obligation of presenting something to the Committee, from 
whom it will probably come before Congress, my 
wish to your Excellency is, that you would give me 
your confidential opinion whether I am acting in or 
out of character, in what I have drawn up for that 
purpose.

My landlord, where I lodged at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, having removed from the house, occasioned my coming 
to town, to pack up my things; after which I shall 
return to Bordentown. and hope, in a few days, to 
have the happiness to see you well at Rocky Hill. 
I am now at Colonel Biddle's. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel=''>General Greene</a> is 
come to <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a>; and I hope for the opportunity 
of seeing him before I leave town, as I understand 
from Colonel Pettit that his health is on the recovery. 
</p><p>
We have no news here. The definitive treaty and 
treaty of commerce are long in completing. I suppose the British begin to find out the weak part of 
America. The imprudent conduct and publications 
of Rhode Island have, among other things, served to 
show it. The British, I believe, would have had no 
idea of superior advantages in a treaty of commerce, 
had they not discovered that the authority of Congress was not sufficient to control or prevent them. 
</p><p>
Though I am most exceedingly obliged to you for 
your good opinion and kind disposition towards me, 
yet I have not a great deal of expectation from Congress. The constant coldness they have shown in 
every thing which respects me, does not, I am apt 
to think, arise from my not having done enough, but 
too much. Many of them, hitherto, were not friends 
to fame in individuals, and perhaps less so to me, 
because that which I gained, or rather, could not 
avoid, though a service to them, was in a line which 
bordered too nearly on their own. So far as this is 
a reason, it makes the case the harder ; yet I cannot help thinking there is some truth in it. I am, 
with every wish for your health and happiness, your 
Excellency's 
</p><p>
Much obliged, and obedient, humble servant,
