<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='19'>19th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. A new experience: Molly and Lawrence have both gone home, and I am to be left for the first time 
in my life wholly at the mercy of hired servants. Mr. Chesnut, being in such deep mourning for his mother, we see no 
company. I have a maid of all work.

Tudy came with an account of yesterday's trip to Petersburg. Constance Gary raved of the golden ripples in 
Tudy's hair. Tudy vanished in a halo of glory, and constance Gary gave me an account of a wedding, as it was 
given to her by Major von Borcke. The bridesmaids were dressed in black, the bride in Confederate gray, homespun. 
She had worn the dress all winter, but it had been washed and turned for the wedding. The female critics pronounced 
it " flabby-dabby." They also said her collar was only " net," and she wore a cameo breastpin. Her bonnet was self-made.
