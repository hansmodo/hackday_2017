Dear Brother : I am still here. Gen. A. went quietly 
over to Frankfort last Thursday, and I hear from him 
that things are progressing favorably. The time seems 
to have passed in this country when the voice of the 
People is considered the voice of God. Notwithstanding 
the large vote for the Union and the controlled majority 
in the Legislature, there is still a doubt whether that 
state will go for the Union. . . .

I think it of vast importance and that Ohio, Indiana 
and Illinois must sooner or later arm every inhabitant, 
and the sooner the better. I hardly apprehend that Beauregard can succeed in getting <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, but should he, 
it will be worse to us than Manassas ; but supposing he 
falls back, he will first try to overwhelm Rosecrans 
in Western Virginia and then look to Tennessee. We 
ought to have here a well appointed Army of a hundred 
thousand men. I don't see where they are to come from, 
but this is the great centre. I still think that Mississippi will be the grand field of operations. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a> 
ought to be taken in all October, even if we have to 
fortify and hold it a year. I think it of more importance than Richmond. It may be that the Southern 
leaders have made such tremendous calls upon their 
people and resources, that if we remain on the defence 
they will exhaust themselves, but upon the first manifest 
symptoms of such a result we should follow it up. Here 
we have no means of offence and but little of defence, 
and if you are full of zeal you could not do better than 
to raise your voice to call the young and middle-aged men 
of Ohio to arms. If they can't get muskets then let 
them get such arms as can be gathered together, or if not 
that, then let them organize in companies in every township and be ready to collect together and move on short 
notice. I am amazed to see here and everywhere such 
apparent indifference when all know that Rebels threaten 
the Capital and are creeping around us in Missouri and 
Kansas. If they are united, and we disunited or indifferent, they will succeed. I knew this reaction was 
natural and to be expected, but it is none the less to be 
deplored. . . .

Affectionately,
