DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I lodged last night in the neighbourhood of New 
Windsor. This morning early, I met Colonel Morgan 
with his corps, about a mile from it, in march for 
head-quarters. I told him the necessity of making 
all the despatch he could, so as not to fatigue his 
men too much which he has promised to do. 
</p><p>
I understand, from Colonel Morgan, that all the 
Northern army were marching down on both sides the 
river, and would probably be to-morrow at <a href='/results.php?city=new windsor' rel='city'>New Windsor</a> and this place; and that <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a> had 
held a Council for the general disposition of them, in 
which it was resolved to send you four thousand men. 
and to keep the rest on this side the river. I came 
here in expectation that matters were in such a train 
as to enable me to accomplish my errand without 
going any farther, unless it should be to hasten the 
troops that were on their march. But, on my arrival, I learn from Mr. Hughes, an Aid-de-camp of 
General Grates, that the following disposition of the 
Northern army had taken place. 
</p><p>
General Patterson's, Glover's, and Nixon's brigades, 
and Colonel Warner's Mountain Boys to remain in 
and about <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>; barracks building for them. 
</p><p>
General Poor's brigade, marching down this side of 
the river to join <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a>, will probably be 
here to-morrow. General Learned's brigade, Morgan's 
corps, Warner's brigade of Massachusetts militia, and 
some regiments of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> militia, on their march 
on the west side of the river. 
</p><p>
I have directed <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a>, in your name, 
to send forward, with all despatch, to join you, the 
two Continental brigades and Warner's militia brigade. 
This last is to serve till the latter end of this month. 
Your instructions did not comprehend any militia; 
but as there are certain accounts here that most of 
the troops from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> are gone to reenforce 
General Howe, and as so large a proportion of the 
Continental troops have been detained at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, I 
concluded you would not disapprove of a measure 
calculated to strengthen you, though but for a small 
time, and have ventured to adopt it, on that presumption. 
</p><p>
Being informed, by <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a>, that General 
Winds, with seven hundred Jersey militia, was at 
King's Ferry, with intention to cross to <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, I 
prevailed upon him to relinquish that idea, and send 
off an immediate order for them to march towards 
Red Bank. 
</p><p>
It is possible, however, unless your Excellency sup 
ports this order by an application from yourself, he 
may march his men home instead of to the place he 
has been directed to repair to. Neither Lee's [nor] Jackson's regiments, nor the detachments belonging 
to <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='colleague'>General McDougall</a>'s division, have yet marched. 
I have pressed their being sent, and an order has 
been despatched for their instantly proceeding. 
</p><p>
Colonel Hughes is pressing some fresh horses for 
me. The moment they are ready, I shall recross the 
river in order to fall in with the troops on the other 
side, and make all the haste I can to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, to get 
the three brigades there sent forward. 
</p><p>
Will your Excellency permit me to observe, that I 
have some doubts, under present circumstances and 
appearances, of the propriety of leaving the regiments 
proposed to be left in this quarter? But if my 
doubts on this subject were stronger than they are, I 
am forbid, by the sense of Council, from interfering 
in this matter. I have the honor to be, with the 
warmest esteem and respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">ALEXANDER HAMILTON</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. General Poor's brigade is just arrived here. 
They will proceed to join you with all expedition. 
So strongly am I impressed with the importance of 
endeavouring to crush Mr. Howe, that I am apt to 
think it would be advisable to draw off all the Continental troops. Had this been determined on, General 
Warner's sixteen hundred militia might have been 
left here.
