<a rel='month origin' value='8'>August</a> <a rel='day origin' value='23'>23d</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. All in a muddle, and yet the news, confused as it is, seems good from all quarters. There is a row in New Orleans. Memphis has been retaken; 2,000 prisoners have been captured at Petersburg, and a Yankee raid on Macon has come to grief.

At Mrs. Izard's met a clever Mrs. Calhoun. Mrs. Calhoun is a violent partizan of Dick Taylor; says Taylor 
does the work and Kirby Smith gets the credit for it. Mrs. Calhoun described the behavior of some acquaintance of 
theirs at Shreveport, one of that kind whose faith removes mountains. Her love for and confidence in the Confederate 
army were supreme. Why not She knew so many of the men who composed that dauntless band. When her husband told her New Orleans had surrendered to a foe whom she despised, she did not believe a word of it. He told her 
to " pack up his traps, as it was time for him to leave Shreveport." She then determined to run down to the 
levee and see for herself, only to find the Yankee gunboats having it all their own way. She made a painful exhibition 
of herself. First, she fell on her knees and prayed; then she got up and danced with rage; then she raved and 
dashed herself on the ground in a fit. There was patriotism 
run mad for you ! As I did not know the poor soul, Mrs. Calhoun's fine acting was somewhat lost on me, but the 
others enjoyed it.

Old Edward Johnston has been sent to Atlanta against his will, and Archer has been made major-general and, contrary to his earnest request, ordered not to his beloved Texans but to the Army of the Potomac.

Mr. C. F. Hampton deplores the untimely end of McPherson. He was so kind to Mr. Hampton at Vicksburg 
last winter, and drank General Hampton's health then and there. Mr. Hampton has asked Brewster, if the report of his 
death prove a mistake, and General McPherson is a prisoner, that every kindness and attention be shown to him. 
General McPherson said at his own table at Vicksburg that General Hampton was the ablest general on our side.

<a href='/results.php?tla=usg' rel=''>Grant</a> can hold his own as well as <a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a>. <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>Lee</a> has a heavy handful in the new Suwarrow. He has worse odds 
than any one else, for when <a href='/results.php?tla=usg' rel=''>Grant</a> has ten thousand slain, he has only to order another ten thousand, and they are 
there, ready to step out to the front. They are like the leaves of Vallambrosa.
