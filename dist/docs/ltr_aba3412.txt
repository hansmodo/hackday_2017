MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
I have been here a month without writing a single 
line to my American friends. About the 28th of 
May we reached <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, and expected to have 
gone into our old quiet lodgings at the Adelphi ; but 
we found every hotel full. The sitting of Parliament, the birth-day of the King, and the famous 
celebration of the music of Handel at Westminster 
Abbey had drawn together such a concourse of people, that we were glad to get into lodgings at the 
moderate price of a guinea per day, for two rooms 
and two chambers at the Bath Hotel, Westminster, 
Piccadilly, where we yet are. This being the Court 
end of the city, it is the resort of a vast concourse of 
carriages. It is too public and noisy for pleasure ; 
but necessity is without law. The ceremony of 
presentation, upon one week to the King, and the 
next to the Queen, was to take place, after which [ 
was to prepare for mine. It is customary, upon 
presentation, to receive visits from all the foreign 
ministers ; so that we could not exchange our lodgings for more private ones, as we might and should, 
had we been only in a private character. The foreign 
ministers, and several English lords and earls, have 
paid their compliments here, and all hitherto is civil 
and polite. I was a fortnight, all the time I could 
get, looking at different houses, but could not find 
any one fit to inhabit under ='200, besides the 
taxes, which mount up to =50 or 60. At last, my 
good genius carried me to one in Grosvenor Square, 
which was not let, because the person who had the 
care of it could let it only for the remaining lease, 
which was one year and three quarters. The price, 
which is not quite c200, the situation, and all together, induced us to close the bargain, and I have 
prevailed upon the person who lets it to paint two 
rooms, which will put it into decent order ; so that, 
as soon as our furniture comes, I shall asain commence housekeeping. Living at a hotel is, I think, 
more expensive than housekeeping, in proportion to 
what one has for his money. We have never had 
more than two dishes at a time upon our table, and 
have not pretended to ask any company, and yet 
we live at a greater expense than twenty-five 
guineas per week. The wages of servants, horsehire, house-rent, and provisions are much dearer 
here than in France. Servants of various sorts, and 
for different departments, are to be procured ; their 
characters are to be inquired into, and this I take upon me, even to the coachman. You can hardly form 
an idea how much I miss my son on this, as well as 
on many other accounts ; but I cannot bear to 
trouble <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> with any thing of a domestic 
kind, who, from morning until evening, has sufficient 
to occupy all his time. You can have no idea of 
the petitions, letters, and private applications for 
assistance, which crowd our doors. Every person represents his case as dismal. Some may really be 
objects of compassion, and some we assist ; but one 
must have an inexhaustible purse to supply them 
all. Besides, there are so many gross impositions 
practised, as we have found in more instances than 
one, that it would take the whole of a person's time 
to trace all their stories. Many pretend to have 
been American soldiers, some to have served as 
officers. A most glaring instance of falsehood, 
however, Colonel Smith l detected in a man of these 
pretensions, who sent to <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> from the King's 
Bench prison, and modestly desired five guineas ; 
a qualified cheat, but evidently a man of letters and 
abilities ; but, if it is to continue in this way, a galley 
slave would have an easier task. 
</p><p>
The Tory venom has begun to spit itself forth in 
the public papers, as I expected, bursting with envy 
that an American minister should be received here 
with the same marks of attention, politeness, and 
civility, which are shown to the ministers of any 
other power. When a minister delivers his credentials to the King, it is always in his private closet, 
attended only by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, 
which is called a private audience, and the minister 
presented makes some little address to his Majesty, 
and the same ceremony to the Queen, whose reply 
was in these w T ords ; " Sir, I thank you for your 
civility to me and my family, and I am glad to see you in this country ;" then she very politely inquired 
whether he had got a house yet. The answer of 
his Majesty was much longer ; but I am not at liberty to say more respecting it, than that it was civil 
and polite, and that his Majesty said he was glad 
the choice of his country had fallen upon him. The 
news-liars know nothing of the matter ; they represent it just to answer their purpose. Last Thursday, 
Colonel Smith was presented at Court, and to-morrow, at the Queen's circle, my ladyship and your 
niece make our compliments. There is no other 
presentation in Europe, in which I should feel so 
much as in this. Your own reflections will easily 
suggest the reasons. 
</p><p>
I have received a very friendly and polite visit 
from the Countess of Effingham. She called, and 
not finding me at home, left a card. I returned 
her visit ; but was obliged to do it by leaving my 
card too, as she was gone out of town ; but, when 
her Ladyship returned, she sent her compliments 
and word, that if agreeable she would take a dish of 
tea with me, and named her day. She accordingly 
came, and appeared a very polite, sensible woman. 
She is about forty, a good person, though a little 
masculine, elegant in her appearance, very easy 
and social. The Earl of Effingham is too well remembered l by America to need any particular recital of his character. His mother is first lady to the Queen. When her Ladyship took leave, she 
desired I would let her know the day I would favor 
her with a visit, as she should be loth to be absent. 
She resides, in summer, a little distance from town. 
The Earl is a member of Parliament, which obliges 
him now to be in town, and she usually comes with 
him, and resides at a hotel a little distance from 
this. 
</p><p>
I find a good many ladies belonging to the Southern States here, many of whom have visited me ; 
I have exchanged visits with several, yet neither of 
us have met. The custom is, however, here much 
more agreeable than in France, for it is as with us ; 
the stranger is first visited. 
</p><p>
The ceremony of presentation here is considered 
as indispensable. There are four minister-plenipotentiaries' ladies here ; but one ambassador, and 
he has no lady. In France, the ladies of ambassadors only are presented. One is obliged here 
to attend the circles of the Queen, which are held 
in summer once a fortnight, but once a week the 
rest of the year ; and what renders it exceedingly 
expensive is, that you cannot go twice the same 
season in the same dress, and a Court dress you 
cannot make use of anywhere else. I directed my 
mantuamaker to let my dress be elegant, but plain 
as I could possibly appear, with decency ; accordingly, it is white lutestring, covered and full trimmed with white crape, festooned with lilac ribbon 
and mock point lace, over a hoop of enormous extent ; there is only a narrow train of about three 
yards in length to the gown waist, which is put into 
a ribbon upon the left side, the Queen only having 
her train borne. Ruffle cuffs for married ladies, 
treble lace ruffles, a very dress cap with long lace 
lappets, two white plumes, and a blonde lace handkerchief. This is my rigging. I should have mentioned two pearl pins in my hair, ear-rings and 
necklace of the same kind. 
</p><p>
Thursday Morning. 
</p><p>
My head is dressed for St. James's, and, in my 
opinion, looks very tasty. Whilst my daughter's is 
undergoing the same operation I set myself down 
composedly to write you a few lines. " Well," methinks I hear Betsey and Lucy say, " what is cousin's 
dress ? " White, my dear girls, like your aunt's, 
only differently trimmed and ornamented ; her train 
being wholly of white crape, and trimmed with 
white ribbon ; the petticoat, which is the most showypart of the dress, covered and drawn up in what are 
called festoons, with light wreaths of beautiful flowers ; the sleeves wdiite crape, drawn over the silk, 
with a row of lace round the sleeve, near the shoulder, another half way down the arm, and a third 
upon the top of the ruffle, a little flower stuck between ; a kind of hat cap, with three large feathers 
and a bunch of flowers ; a wreath of flowers upon 
the hair. Thus equipped, we go in our own carriage, and <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> and Colonel Smith in his. 
But I must quit my pen to put myself in order for 
the ceremony, which begins at two o'clock. When I 
return I will relate to you my reception ; but do not 
let it circulate, as there may be persons eager to 
catch at every thing, and as much given to misrepresentation as here. I would gladly be excused the ceremony. 
</p><p>
Friday Morning. 
</p><p>
Congratulate me, my dear sister, it is over. I 
was too much fatigued to write a line last evening. 
At two o'clock we went to the circle, which is in the 
drawing-room of the Queen. We passed through 
several apartments, lined as usual with spectators 
upon these occasions. Upon entering the antechamber, the Baron de Lynden, the Dutch Minister, 
who has been often here, came and spoke with me. 
A Count Sarsfield, a French nobleman, with whom 
I was acquainted, paid his compliments. As I 
passed into the drawing-room, Lord Carmarthen and 
Sir Clement Cotterel Dormer were presented to me. 
Though they had been several times here, I had never seen them before. The Swedish and the Polish 
ministers made their compliments, and several other 
gentlemen ; but not a single lady did I know until 
the Countess of Effingham came, who was very 
civil. There were three young ladies, daughters of 
the Marquis of Lothian, who were to be presented 
at the same time, and two brides. We were placed 
in a circle round the drawing-room, which was very 
full, I believe two hundred persons present. Only think of the task! The royal family have to go 
round to every person, and find small talk enough to 
speak to all of them, though they very prudently 
speak in a whisper, so that only the person who 
stands next you can hear what is said. The King 
enters the room, and goes round to the right ; the 
Queen and Princesses to the left. The lord in waiting presents you to the King ; and the lady in waiting 
does the same to her Majesty. The King is a personable man, but, my dear sister, he has a certain countenance, which you and I have often remarked ; a 
red face and white eyebrows. The Queen has a 
similar countenance, and the numerous royal family 
confirm the observation. Persons are not placed according to their rank in the drawing-room, but promiscuously ; and when the King comes in he takes 
persons as they stand. When he came to me, Lord 
Onslow said, " <a href='/results.php?tla=aba' rel='me'>Mrs. Adams</a> " ; upon which I drew 
off my right-hand glove, and his Majesty saluted my 
left cheek ; then asked me if I had taken a walk today. I could have told his Majesty that I had been 
all the morning preparing to wait upon him ; but I 
replied, " No, Sire." " Why, don't you love walking ? " says he. I answered, that I was rather 
indolent in that respect. He then bowed, and passed on. It was more than two hours after this before it came to my turn to be presented to the 
Queen. The circle was so large that the company 
were four hours standing. The Queen was evidently embarrassed when I was presented to her. 
I had disagreeable feelings too. She, however, 
said, " <a href='/results.php?tla=aba' rel='me'>Mrs. Adams</a>, have you got into your house ? 
Pray, how do you like the situation of it ? ' Whilst 
the Princess Royal looked compassionate, and asked 
me if I was not much fatigued ; and observed, that it 
was a verv full drawing-room. Her sister, who came 
next, Princess <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a>, after having asked your niece 
if she was ever in England before, and her answering " Yes," inquired of me how long ago, and supposed it was when she was very young. And all this 
is said with much affability, and the ease and freedom 
of old acquaintance. The manner, in which they 
make their tour round the room, is, first, the Queen, 
the lady in waiting behind her, holding up her 
train ; next to her, the Princess Royal ; after her, 
Princess <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a>, and their lady in waiting behind 
them. They are pretty, rather than beautiful, wellshaped, with fair complexions, and a tincture of the 
King's countenance. The two sisters look much 
alike ; they were both dressed in black and silver 
silk, with a silver netting upon the coat, and their 
heads full of diamond pins. The Queen was in 
purple and silver. She is not well shaped nor 
handsome. As to the ladies of the Court, rank and 
title may compensate for want of personal charms ; 
but they are, in general, very plain, ill-shaped, and 
ugly ; but don't you tell anybody that 1 say so. If 
one wants to see beauty, one must go to Ranelagh ; 
there it is collected, in one bright constellation. 
There were two ladies very elegant, at Court, Lady 
Salisbury and Lady Talbot ; but the observation did 
not in general hold good, that fine feathers make 
fine birds. I saw many who were vastly richer 
dressed than your friends, but I will venture to say, 
that I saw none neater or more elegant ; which 
praise I ascribe to the taste of Mrs. Temple and my 
mantuamaker ; for, after having declared that I 
would not have any foil or tinsel about me, they 
fixed upon the dress I have described. Mrs. Temple 
is my near neighbour, and has been very friendly 
to me. Mr. Temple, you know, is deaf, so that I 
cannot hold much conversation with him. 
</p><p>
The Tories are very free with their compliments. 
Scarcely a paper escapes without some scurrility. 
We bear it with silent contempt ; having met a 
polite reception from the Court, it bites them like a 
serpent, and stings them like an adder. As to the 
success the negotiations may meet with, time alone 
can disclose the result ; but, if this nation does not 
suffer itself to be again duped by the artifice of 
some and the malice of others, it will unite itself 
with America on the most liberal principles and sentiments. 
</p><p>
Captain Dashwood come ? Why, I have not half 
done. I have not told your aunt yet, that, whilst I 
was writing, I received her thrice-welcome letters, 
and from my dear cousins too, aunt Shaw and all ; 
nor how sometimes I laughed, and sometimes I 
cried. Yet there was nothing sorrowful in the letters, only they were too tender for me. What, not 
time to say I will write to all of them as soon as 
possible ? Why, I know they will all think 1 ought 
to write ; but how is it possible ? Let them think 
what I have had to do, and what I have had to accomplish, as my furniture is come, and will be landed to-morrow. Eat the sweetmeats. Divide them 
amongst you, and the choicest sweetmeat of all I 
shall have in thinking; that you eniov them. 
</p><p>
I went, last evening, to Ranelagb : but I must reserve that story for the young folk. You see I am 
in haste. 
</p><p>
Believe me most tenderly yours, 
</p><p>
