</p><p>
...I grieve at the necessity that drives you from your home.  I can
appreciate your feelings on the occasion, and pray that you may receive
comfort and strength in the difficulties that surround you.  When I
reflect upon the calamity impending over the country, my own sorrows
sink into insignificance....  Be content and resigned to God's will.
I shall be able to write seldom.  Write to me, as you letters will be
my greatest comfort.  I send a check for $500; it is all I have in
bank.  Pay the children's school expenses....
