Sir, 
</p><p>
The present strength of the garrison at <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a> 
is two hundred and thirty. At least thirty of these 
are unfit for field duty, and several, even garrison 
duty From this number, detachments are made to 
garrison Forts Mcintosh and Wheeling, the first distant thirty miles, the latter eighty. <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a> is in a 
bad state for defence ; Fort Mcintosh, pretty easily repaired. If <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a> were in the best state, the work 
is too extensive for less than a garrison of at least 
four hundred and fifty men, to make a tolerable defence. Fort Mcintosh would take one hundred and 
fifty to defend it properly, and be able to send patrolling parties towards Wheeling. 
</p><p>
Wheeling should have twenty-five or thirty men, 
and an equal number at some intermediate post. From 
<a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a> to the Laurel Hill, northwards, it would take 
two hundred men in actual service, from the first of 
April to the last of October, to guard that quarter 
from the incursions of the savages. By this arrangement, it would take nine hundred and fifty men to 
act on the defensive The whole of the summer season. 
The number of militia in Washington county is said 
to he two thousand; in Westmoreland, one thousand. 
The inhabitants are dispirited, and talk much of making their escape early in the spring to the east side 
of the mountain, unless they see a prospect of support. 
</p><p>
The Indians have all left us, except ten men ; and, 
by the best accounts, are preparing to make a stroke 
in the spring, either against General Clark, at the 
Rapids, or on <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>; which, my informant could 
not with certainty say, but was positive one or the 
other was intended. I am apprehensive, from the 
steps taken by the Commandant at Detroit, that something serious is intended. First, thirteen nations of 
Indians have been treated with, in the beginning of 
November; at the conclusion, they were directed to 
keep themselves compact, and ready to assemble on 
short notice. Secondly, the Moravians are carried into captivity, and strictly watched, and threatened with 
severe punishment, if they should attempt to give us 
information of their movements. Thirdly, part of five 
nations are assembled at Sandusky. The Shawanese 
and lowas have settled nearer Detroit than formerly. 
There is no magazine of provision laid in at any of 
our posts, to hold out a siege ; ammunition exhausted ; 
no craft to transport materials for repairing the fort, 
or to keep up a communication with Fort Mcintosh 
or Wheeling, or to supply these posts with provision 
or stores, in case of exigence. 
</p><p>
To carry on an expedition against Detroit would 
take two thousand men, to give a tolerable certainty 
of success ; the time would be three months, and the 
best season to march from <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>, the 1st of August. Then the waters are low; morasses, and soft, rich 
meadows dried up ; by land totally, preferable to any 
part by water, the enemy having entire command of 
the lake with armed vessels ; the navigation of rivers 
uncertain ; besides, the number of boats, and waste of 
time, would make it more expensive than land carriage. Pack-horses to carry provision would be better 
and more certain than wagons ; but, as a road must 
be cut for artillery, the ammunition and military stores 
would be transported with greater facility and more 
safety in wagons. One thousand horses would carry 
flour for two thousand men for three months. Beef 
must be driven on foot. Twenty-five wagons would 
carry military stores sufficient for the train, which 
should consist of two twelve-pounders, two sixes, one 
three-pounder, one eight-inch howitzer, and one royal. 
At least one half should be regular troops. If it is 
necessary to keep half the number of troops to act 
on the defensive that it will to act offensively, and 
three months are sufficient to complete the expedition, 
then the only difference in the expense will be transportation of provision and stores; as acting on the defensive, seven months will be the least, and the same 
quantity of provision will be consumed, and ammunition wasted. If we act offensively, it will draw the 
whole attention of the enemy to their own defence, 
by which our settlements will have peace; and such of 
the militia, as do not go on the expedition, will have 
time to raise crops. On the contrary, continual alarms 
will keep them from these necessary duties. The garrison at Detroit is three hundred regular troops, the 
militia (Canadians), from seven hundred to one thousand ; the number of Indians that could assemble in 
ten days' notice, to a certain point, about one thousand. 
</p><p>
Query. Should we be able to take Detroit, shall we hold it ? If not, what advantage will the bare reduction of the place be of, if immediately evacuated ? 
</p><p>
Answer. The reduction of Detroit, in the fall of 
the year, will prevent an intercourse with the Western 
Indians for a whole year, as it would be late in the 
succeeding summer before the British could reestablish 
themselves, during which time we might either open 
a trade with such savages as would ask for peace, or, 
by frequently penetrating into, and establishing posts 
in their country, oblige them to retire to such a distance as would put it out of their power to harass 
the back inhabitants. It would be attended with 
great expense, and vast risk, to support a garrison at 
Detroit, as long as the British possess the lower part 
of Canada, and have the command of Lake Erie. 
</p><p>
The present garrison is too weak to repair the fort, 
and perform other necessary duties ; no cash to pay 
artificers ; the troops in bad temper for want of pay ; 
under very bad discipline; too long in one station, as 
they have formed such connections as make them tenacious of the rights of citizens, while they at the 
same time retain all the vices common to a soldiery. 
What is contained in the foregoing report, is all that 
occurs to my memory at present, necessary to trouble your Excellency with. I have the honor to be, 
with perfect respect. Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,
