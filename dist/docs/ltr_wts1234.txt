Dear Brother: I have just returned from Saratoga 
and Lake George, and am now arranging for Providence, 
R.I., where on the Fourth of July there is to be inaugurated an equestrian statue of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aeb" rel="colleague met">General Burnside</a>. I was 
always one of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aeb" rel="colleague met"><a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aeb" rel="colleague met">Burnside's</a></a> personal friends, but after the 
battle of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chattanooga" rel="city">Chattanooga</a> or Missionary Eidge, and after I 
had forced my Army of the Tennessee to march by land 
450 miles in October, November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1863">1863</a>, from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a> 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chattanooga" rel="city">Chattanooga</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a>, finding the Fourth Corps 
General Gordon Granger moving too slow, called 
on me to go to his relief at Knoxville, which I did effectually and conclusively. Burnside in Knoxville reporting to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="colleague met">Mr. Lincoln</a> direct, treated his siege as a question of supplies, viz., that his supplies would be exhausted 
about December 3d, when want would compel him to 
surrender. I was therefore forced to march my already 
weary Ariny of the Tennessee near 136 miles in four 
days, or be held responsible for the terrible consequences 
of his surrender. I forced my men at twenty-six miles 
a day, and when I got to Knoxville I found inside a fine 
pen of cattle, and was invited to dine with Burnside at a 
dinner with a roast turkey, tablecloth, knives, forks, 
and spoons, which I had not seen for years. My 
Memoirs described the literal truth, but <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aeb" rel="colleague met">Burnside's</a> 
friends thought it hard on him, and now I shall go to 
the dedication of his monument to apologize for telling 
the truth. Others may orate, I will not. I will simply 
assert a personal friendship. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aeb" rel="colleague met">Burnside</a> was not a combative man. He was kind, good, and patriotic, as you 
saw him in the Senate, but he did not come up to the 
occasion. In war we must use all forces, and now when 
we look back we recognize the qualities of each. Burnside was a good man, but he was not a war soldier.

The <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> papers make out that you and I differ. 
Of course, we all differ. I stand by the authorities. . . . 
Mr. Cleveland is President, so recognized by Congress, Supreme Court, and the world. Now, by the 
Fifth Article of War, made the law before you were 
born, every officer of the Army of the United States who 
speaks disrespectfully of the President of the United 
States becomes a felon the same as one who has committed murder, felony, forgery, treason, or any crime, 
and could be punished at the discretion of a court-martial. 
I am still an officer of the army, and cannot violate this 
law. Of course I know Drum, the Adjutant-General. 
He has no sympathy with the army which fought. He 
was a non-combatant. He never captured a flag, and, 
values it only at its commercial value. He did not think 
of the blood and torture of battle ; nor can Endicott, the 
Secretary of War, or Mr. Cleveland. . . . Still, in 
Republics majorities govern, and since only one in sixteen go to war, non-combatants always govern. The 
soldier who fights must take a back seat and apologize 
for his vehemence in action. Grant had to apologize, 
Sheridan to shelter himself behind his most proper 
orders to devastate the Valley of the Shenandoah, and 
Sherman to be abused and assailed for the accidental 
burning of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbia" rel="city">Columbia</a> in the day of Republican rule. . . . 
In <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1861">1861</a>-65 we fought for union and right. The soldiers 
restored to Congress full power, and returned to their 
civil vocations. Congress surrendered the country to the 
non-combatants, and now it is questionable whether Lincoln or <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jed rel="adversary">Jeff. Davis</a> was the Union man. Jeff now says 
he never meant war. He thought that they would be 
allowed to do as they pleased without war. Lincoln was 
the assailant, Davis only on the "defensive-offensive."
