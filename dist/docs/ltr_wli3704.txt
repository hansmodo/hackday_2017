Sir, 
In my letter of the 21st of May, I mentioned to 
your Excellency that a body of volunteer militia were 
assembling at the Mingo Bottom, to go against Sandusky. The inclosed letters, one from Colonel Williamson, second in command, and the other from 
Lieutenant Rose, my Aid-de-camp, contain all the particulars of this transaction which have yet come to 
my knowledge. I am of opinion, had they reached 
the place in seven days, instead of ten, which might 
have been done, especially as they were chiefly mounted, they would have succeeded. They should also 
have pushed the advantage evidently gained at the 
commencement of the action. They failed in another 
point, which they had my advice, and indeed positive 
orders for, namely, to make the last day's march as long as possible, and attack the place in the night; 
but they halted in the evening, within nine miles, and 
fired their rifles at seven in the morning, before they 
marched. These people now seem convinced that 
they cannot perform as much by themselves as they 
some time since thought they could. Perhaps it is 
right that they should put more dependence on regular troops. I am sorry I have not more, to afford 
them assistance. I have the honor to be. 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,
