MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE House of Representatives have not yet deter 
mined. The question is to be called up on Monday. But the opposition, who now call themselves 
the virtuous majority, will endeavor still to postpone 
it. It is now avowed by Mr. Bond, the British charge 
d affaires, that the surrender of the posts is suspended 
upon the determination of the House of Representatives. And who could expect it would be otherwise ? 
I have read " the minister s" despatches from Lon 
don. The King could not help discovering his old 
ill humor. The mad idiot will never recover. Blunderer by nature, accidents are all against him. Every 
measure of his reign has been wrong. It seems they 
don t like Pinckney. They think he is no friend to 
that country, and too much of a French Jacobin. 
They wanted to work up some idea or other of introducing another in his place, but our young politician 
saw into them too deeply to be duped. At his last 
visit to court, the king passed him without speaking 
to him, which you know will be remarked by courtiers of all nations. I am glad of it ; for I would 
not have my son go so far as <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>, and affirm the 
friendly disposition of that country to this. I know 
better. I know their jealousy, envy, hatred, and revenge, covered under pretended contempt. 
</p><p>
I am so fatigued and disgusted with the insipidity 
of this dull life, that I am half of a mind to vow that 
if Washington don t resign, I will. The old hero 
looks very grave of late. However, there is a high 
probability that I am upon my last year of public 
life, for if there should not be a choice by the people, 
I will not suffer a vote to be given for me in the 
House of Representatives. I will never serve in that 
high and responsible situation without some foundation of people to stand on. If I should be chosen 
Vice President only by a plurality, I will refuse. In 
short, there are so many probable cases in which I 
am determined to retire that the probability of it is, 
upon the whole, very strong. Indeed, I feel myself 
to be a fool to serve here at all. 
</p><p>
I am glad that you cast off the fret upon your mind. 
You received some post notes soon after the date of 
yours of 28th of March, which enabled you to face 
your creditors and gave you more courage, I hope. 
</p><p>
I am
