MT DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
WE have a turn of weather as cold as any we have 
had through the whole winter. The violence of the 
north-west wind, which has thrown down chimneys 
and blown off roofs in this city, we suppose, has pre 
vented the eastern mail from crossing the North River 
and deprived me of my Thursday's letter as yet. I 
hope it will come to-day. 
</p><p>
A thousand and one speeches have been made in 
the House of Representatives upon the motion for 
petitioning the President for papers. Twenty complete demonstrations have been made of the constitutionality of it, and twenty more of its unconstitutionally. Ten of its expediency, and as many of its in 
expediency. Five of its utility, and the same number of its inutility. After all, they will ask and receive, and then lash and maul awhile, and then do the 
needful. I dined on the 17th with the friendly sons 
of St. Patrick, and to-day I dine with Rush. Judge 
Gushing departs this morning, and Mrs. Gushing will 
call upon you. Ellsworth embarks in a day or two 
for South Carolina and Georgia. 
</p><p>
We have a party business from Kentucky ; a strange 
complaint against Mr. Marshall, which obliges us to 
sit to-day, Saturday. I regret this, because it is too 
exhausting to me to sit so constantly. My task is 
pretty severe, especially in cold weather. This wind 
will delay intelligence from Europe for ten days or a 
fortnight. Liancourt is going with Ellsworth, and 
Talleyrand talks of embarking for Hamburg. Having no horse, and reading more and walking less than 
usual, I am solicitous about my health. The birds, in 
numbers and variety, began to sing, and the grass to 
grow green, before this last gripe of Queen Mab. 
The poor birds have hard times now. 
</p><p>
I cannot see a ray of hope before June. If the 
House should be frenzical, we must sit till next March, 
and leave it to the people to decide by choosing a new 
President, Senate and House, who will harmoniously 
go all lengths, call George a tyrant to his face, the 
English nation pirates, break the treaty, enter into an 
alliance offensive with France, and go to war with 
spirit, consistency and dignity. But I believe the 
House will adopt the language which says that the 
just keep their promises though they have made 
them to their hurt, and that they must make the best 
of a bad bargain, and come off thus, as well as they 
can, by abusing Jay, President, and Senate, and 
treaty, without pretending to annul it. 
</p><p>
Hi ! ho ! Oh dear ! I am, most tenderly, 
</p><p>
