MY DEAR MADISON, General Bernadotte is so gloriously introduced by his own reputation and character, that I shall 
only present him to you as my personal friend. He is of all men the one I should 
prefer to see going to America as an ambassador, was he not also the man whom 
all true and steady patriots cannot but heartily wish to keep nearer to his own 
country, where none surpass and few can equal the sincerity and steadiness of his 
republican civism. Madame Bernadotte accompanies him on this mission, and I 
hope the amiable consort of the general will meet from our American ladies the 
reception to which she is so well entitled. She particularly wishes to obtain the 
friendship of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=dol" rel="friend">MRS. MADISON</a>, and I have no doubt, from the knowledge of your 
mutual sentiments, that the intimacy will be soon established between the two families. Mr. Livingstone's correspondence 
will acquaint you with the political transactions of Europe, and the situation of affairs respecting America. I shall the less 
expatiate on these points as I am under very painful operations, resulting from an accident, the particulars of which may be 
given you by General Bernadotte. With heartfelt gratitude, but without surprise, I 
have heard in how friendly a way you have interested yourself about my affairs. 
</p><p>
I hope a long letter from me . . . has reached you. May the affair of Louisiana 
be settled in a satisfactory manner, so that her passage to the situation of an united 
and independent commonwealth, as it can not fail in every chance to be soon the 
case, be not attended with any disagreement between the two countries to whom 
I am so patriotically bound. Adieu, my dear sir. 
</p><p>
I am most affectionately your old and constant friend, 
</p><p>
