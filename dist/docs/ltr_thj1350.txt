<p>
TO HIS EXCELLENCY <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="co-worker met">General Washington</a>.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>,
</p><p>
October 2, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1779">1779</a>.
</p><p>
Sir,
</p><p>
Just as the letter accompanying this was going off, Colonel Mathews
arrived on parole from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">New York</a>, by the way of headquarters, bringing
your Excellency's letter on this subject, with that of the British
commissary of prisoners. The subject is of great importance, and I must,
therefore, reserve myself to answer after further consideration. Were
I to speak from present impressions, I should say it was happy for
Governor Hamilton that a final determination of his fate was formed
before this new information. As the enemy have released Captain Willing
from his irons, the Executive of this State will be induced perhaps not
to alter their former opinion. But it is impossible they can be serious
in attempting to bully us in this manner. We have too many of their
subjects in our power, and too much iron to clothe them with, and, I
will add, too much resolution to avail ourselves of both, to fear their
pretended retaliation. However, I will do myself the honor of forwarding
to your Excellency the ultimate result of Council on this subject.
</p><p>
In consequence of the information in the letter from the British
commissary of prisoners, that no officers of the Virginia line should
be exchanged till Governor Hamilton's affair should be settled, we have
stopped our flag, which was just hoisting anchor with a load of privates
for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">New York</a>. I must, therefore, ask the favor of your Excellency to
forward the enclosed by flag, when an opportunity offers, as I suppose
General Phillips will be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">New York</a> before it reaches you.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, Sir, with the greatest esteem,
</p><p>
your most obedient
</p><p>
and most humble servant,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="me">Th: Jefferson</a>.
</p>
