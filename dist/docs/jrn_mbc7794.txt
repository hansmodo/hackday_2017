<a rel='month origin' value='5'>May</a> <a rel='day origin' value='16'>16th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=camden' rel='city origin'>CAMDEN</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. We are scattered and stunned, the remnant of heart left alive within us filled with brotherly hate. We 
sit and wait until the drunken tailor who rules the United States of America issues a proclamation, and defines our 
anomalous position.

Such a hue and cry, but whose fault? Everybody is blamed by somebody else. The dead heroes left stiff and 
stark on the battle-field escape, blame every man who stayed at home and did not fight. I will not stop to hear excuses. 
There is not one word against those who stood out until the bitter end, and stacked muskets at Appomattox.
