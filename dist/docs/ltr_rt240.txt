<p> Dear Lois,
<p> Guess maybe some of your questions are answered for you no doubt have gotten my letter, but I&#8217;ll repeat. Sorry I didn&#8217;t get a chance to write sooner but maybe you can imagine how rushed and happy I have been and am. It&#8217;s sort of hard to settle down and do letter writing you know. J.P. and I have been seeing a lot of each other and that takes up lot&#8217;s of time but we just can&#8217;t help it. Remember, you were telling me one time on the trip to Bremertan how you hoped I&#8217;d be in love someday? Well dear, I had been, and still am, only now all paths are cleared and you can believe me when I say it&#8217;s the real thing, for both of us. We have been very foolish in the past, but it was my fault, and it will never happen again. Thank God he&#8217;s here for a while and he will come back, of that we are both certain. If not, per chance, we&#8217;ve at least had some time together. Dear, I could rattle on like this for hours, but guess I should get down and tell you some of the other things you want to know. No, I haven&#8217;t called John yet but will right away and have had every intention of doing so sooner. Thanks for reminding me though. The wedding will be at 7:30 Saturday evening. No, I can&#8217;t go anywhere after the wedding. J.P. starts to bomb disposal school Monday and can&#8217;t go away. However, when he finishes school we plan a trip for a week or more- you know the Navy- can&#8217;t really say, but anyway, he will be able to have at least a short furlough and we can have our honeymoon- seems funny- then. You see, he&#8217;s seen a lot of action so he will be able to get some time, but of course not all coming to him. There is just a possibility that he may be able to stay three months- I do hope so, but even at that we are darned lucky he&#8217;s here at all. Oh gosh, this will have to wait until I see you I guess? 
<p> I&#8217;m planning on taking Thurs. and Fri. off so I&#8217;ll meet you at the train. I&#8217;m getting nothing done so far so maybe you can help me with some last minute shopping. We went downtown to pick out the ring last night. It&#8217;s lovely, I hated to take it off, but it has to be engraved. Seems like there&#8217;s an awful lot to do with even the simplest of weddings! 
<p> Oh, I&#8217;m anxious to see you! Got a letter from Mom yesterday. She seemed to be very tickled, also from Aunt Ruth and Doris Mae. They all sat right down and wrote. We had lot&#8217;s of fun reading their letters together. J.P. was here when I got home. I do so wish that they all could come to the wedding but I know they will be thinking of us all and that&#8217;s a mighty nice feeling too. Doris Mae said it&#8217;s the first time she&#8217;s been sorry I&#8217;m back here! You must read them when you get here. Gee, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re coming Thursday! 
<p> Oh yes, next week J.P. starts classes and has then from 7:30 in the morning until 9:30 or 10:00 at night- so- I&#8217;ll be plenty lonesome. Guess you won&#8217;t get to see him until Saturday. I won&#8217;t either- isn&#8217;t that awful- but then there is a war going on. That is the first two weeks so maybe the first week of my marriage I&#8217;ll be able to catch up on my correspondence! Golly, how I rattle on. There is so much to say, I don&#8217;t know where to begin or stop. 
<p> You&#8217;ll like J.P. and so will Mark. He&#8217;s changed- not in appearance but in other ways. It&#8217;s sure wonderful the way we get along, and I know I could never do better in picking out a husband. Oh Lois, it&#8217;s been well worth waiting for, and he is well worth it. 
<p> Well dear, I must close now and get down to the drug store. Oh yes, we plan on living in San Diego when this little mess is over. Nice eh? I think so, and I know I&#8217;ll like it a lot.
<p> Worlds of love to you, Mark and E.R. I&#8217;m so anxious to meet him again- cause he&#8217;s changed I know. Cuter than ever,
<p> Love Ruth
<p> Dan is going to try and come. He sounds nice- very nice!
