how many persons have I seen in love? Not a half-dozen. And I am a tolerably close observer, a faithful watcher 
have I been from my youth upward of men and manners. Society has been for me only an enlarged field for character study.

Flirtation is the business of society; that is, playing at love-making. It begins in vanity, it ends in vanity. It is 
spurred on by idleness and a want of any other excitement. Flattery, battledore and shuttlecock, how in this game flattery is dashed backward and forward. It is so soothing to self-conceit. If it begins and ends in vanity, vexation of 
spirit supervenes sometimes. They do occasionally burn their fingers awfully, playing with fire, but there are no 
hearts broken. Each party in a flirtation has secured a sympathetic listener, to whom he or she can talk of himself 
or herself somebody who, for the time, admires one exclusively, and, as the French say, excessivement. It is a 
pleasant, but very foolish game, and so to bed.

<a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> and Thomas have had a fearful fight, with carnage and loss of generals excessive in proportion to numbers. That means they were leading and urging their men up to the enemy. I know how Bartow and Barnard Bee 
were killed bringing up their men. One of Mr. Chesnut's sins thrown in his teeth by the Legislature of South Carolina was that he procured the promotion of Gist, " State Rights " Gist, by his influence in Richmond. What have 
these comfortable, stay-at-home patriots to say of General Gist now? " And how could man die better than facing fearful odds," etc.

So Fort McAlister has fallen ! Good-by, Savannah ! Our Governor announces himself a follower of Joe Brown, of Georgia. Another famous Joe.
