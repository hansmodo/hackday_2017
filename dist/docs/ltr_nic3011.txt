SIR, 
</p><p>
I have your Excellency's letter of the 17th, which I have laid before the General Committee. Should the force sailed from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> be destined for Rhode 
Island, I tremble for the consequences, as the Colony, 
in its present exhausted state, cannot, without assistance, defend the Island. At their unanimous request, 
I apply to your Excellency for a detachment from 
the Continental Army, of one regiment, to be stationed 
upon Rhode Island, and that you would please to 
appoint a general officer to take the command of the 
whole force there. They also desired me to inform 
you, that General Lee will be very acceptable to the 
Colony, and to request that the general officer who 
may be appointed may set out immediately, to take 
the command of the troops upon the Island, and put 
it in the best posture of defence. 
</p><p>
We have, at head-quarters, about two hundred and 
fifty men, and shall immediately place on there about 
four hundred more, and hold as many more in readiness as possible. I need not point out to you the 
importance of the Island, and the inability of the 
Colony. I am, in great haste, 
</p><p>
Your very humble servant, 
</p><p>

P. S. Captain Wallace hath hinted, to some of his 
friends, that he expects a reenforcernent daily.
