</p><p>
MY DEAREST FRIEND : Your last esteemed letter I have duly received. I am both rejoiced and saddened at it. 
Rejoiced I am, that it should be my good fortune to be so kindly held in the light I see I am, by those so dear to 
me, as you and your estimable lady. I am, however, both saddened and distressed, that my affairs are not in 
that train to permit me to join you in this month, as I had fondly contemplated, and as you so much wish. 
Such is the nature of our business, that it is utterly impossible for me to wind it up at present, and this from 
new and unexpected obstacles obstacles which I shall fully explain to your satisfaction, and the satisfaction of 
our great and common friend, when we meet. 
</p><p>
How grateful and flattered do I feel, my valued sir, for the good opinion you are pleased to express and entertain 
of me. On this subject I shall only further add, that I trust I shall never disappoint you in these sentiments, 
and that I may yet have opportunities of evincing my gratitude by actions instead of words.
</p><p>
* Please present your worthy Mrs. Blennerhassett with my kindest and best respects, and assure yourself, my 
ever dear sir, of the warm attachment I shall ever feel for you, and those that belong to you. 
</p><p>
Yours most truly, <a href="/results.php?tla=jde" rel="me">J. DEVEREUX</a>. 
</p><p>
p. S. Should you see our distinguished friend shortly, recall me to him with that ardent respect and attachment which I feel for him. Don't forget. 
</p>
