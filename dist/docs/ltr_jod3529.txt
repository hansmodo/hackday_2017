MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE just sent Mr. Thaxter, Johnny and Stevens 
with the things on board. I shall go with Charles at 
four o clock. It is now three. I have seen the captain and the navy board, etc. It is proposed to sail tomorrow ; perhaps, however, it may not be till next day. Mr. Dana will come on board at nine tomor 
row. <a href='/results.php?tla=joh' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Hancock</a> has sent me a card to invite me 
to go on board with him in the castle barge. Don t 
make many words of this. Your aunt has given me 
a barrel of cranberries. I shall make a good use of 
them, I hope. 
</p><p>
Let me entreat you to keep up your spirits and 
throw off cares as much as possible. Love to Abby 
and Tommy. We shall yet be happy, I hope and pray, 
and I don t doubt it. I shall have vexations enough, 
as usual. You will have anxiety and tenderness 
enough, as usual. Pray strive not to have too much. 
I will write by every opportunity I can get. 
Yours ever, ever yours, 
</p><p>
