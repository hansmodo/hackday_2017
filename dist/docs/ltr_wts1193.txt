Dear Brother : I have now been in New Mexico three 
weeks along with Col. Tappan, peace commissioner, for 
the purpose of seeing the Navajos, and making some permanent disposition of them. By a debate in the Senate I 
see you have a pretty good idea of their former history. 
These Indians seem to have acquired from the old Spaniards a pretty good knowledge of farming, rearing sheep, 
cattle, and goats, and of making their own clothing by 
weaving blankets and cloth. They were formerly a 
numerous tribe, occupying the vast region between New 
Mexico and the Colorado of the West, and had among 
them a class of warriors who made an easy living by stealing of the New Mexicans and occasionally killing. . . . 
</p><p>
We found 7200 Indians there, seemingly abject and disheartened. They have been there four years. The first 
year they were maintained by the army at a cost of about 
$700,000, and made a small crop. The second year the 
cost was about $500,000, and the crop was small. Last 
year the crop was an utter failure, though all the officers 
say they labored hard and faithfully. This year they 
would not work because they said it was useless. The 
cost has been diminished to about 12 cents per head a 
day, which for 7000 Indians makes over $300,000, and 
this is as low as possible, being only a pound of corn, and 
a pound of beef with a little salt per day. 
</p><p>
Now this was the state of facts, and we could see no 
time in the future when this could be amended. The 
scarcity of wood, the foul character of water, which is 
salty and full of alkali, and their utter despair, made it 
certain that we would have to move them or they would 
scatter and be a perfect nuisance. So of course we concluded to move them. After debating all the country at 
our option, we have chosen a small part of their old country, which is as far out of the way of the whites and of 
our future probable wants as possible, and have agreed 
to move them there forthwith, and have made a treaty 
which Avill save the heavy cost of their maintenance and 
give as much probability of their resuming their habits 
of industry as the case admits of. ...

Of course I have noticed Grant's acceptance. I take it 
for granted he will be elected, and I must come to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. I shall not, however, commit myself to this promotion till he is not only elected but until he vacates and 
I am appointed and confirmed. . . .

Yours affectionately,
