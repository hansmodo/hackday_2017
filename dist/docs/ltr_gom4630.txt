My Dear Carmichael, 
</p><p>
I have received your letters of the twenty-ninth of August, 
and fifteenth of October. I feel perfectly your situation and 
have frequently lamented that you had not powers equal to 
the position in which you are placed. It would seem that 
we know not yet the value of the moment, and I fear that we 
shall find to our cost that post est opportunitas calva. When 
Mr Short was here, he talked of going to Madrid, but, from 
what cause I know not, appeared to me indecisive, and apprehensive, to a degree which was astonishing. Whether this 
arises from nature, or from long habits of ease in this city, I know not. 
</p><p>
I shall forward by Colonel Smith to Mr Pinckney, the intelligence you sent me for him. I shall tell him at the same 
time that, in my opinion, the principal object in contemplation 
is France, and that the United States are only affected by a 
side wind. However, that is of little importance, since a side 
wind may do as much mischief to our ship as any other. 
</p><p>
As to the state of things here, I can give you no very satis 
factory or flattering accounts. True it is that the French 
arms are crowned with great success. Towns fall before them 
without a blow, and the declaration of rights produces an effect equal at least to the trumpets of Joshua ; but as on the 
one hand [ never questioned the force of France if united, and 
her natural enthusiasm warmed by the ardor of newborn freedom, so on the other I was always apprehensive, that they 
would be deficient in that cool reflection, which appears needful to consolidate a free government. We read in the history 
of man, as it is developed in the great book of nature, that empires do by no means depend on their success in arms, but on their 
civil, religious, and political constitutions, and that in the framing 
of these it is a useless question what kinds are best in them 
selves. The more so, as good and bad here below, but especially in that which we now contemplate, are mere relative 
terms. The true object of a great statesman is to give to any 
particular nation the kind of laws, which is suitable to them, 
and the best constitution which they are capable of. Now 
by as much as it is an easy thing, and within the compass of 
every schoolboy, to deal in generals and abstractions, pursuing 
demonstrations which in moral subjects are frequently least 
exact when they appear to be most evident, by so much is it 
of high and almost insurmountable difficulty, to descend into 
the nice estimates of manners, habits, and sentiments, and, 
amidst the discord of loud and contradictory passions and interests, to discover the means of establishing a harmonious 
system, where each part has the needful relation to every other, 
and to the great whole. &gt; 
</p><p>
These observations are, I know, familiar to you, and to every other sensible man, who has had much experience in hu 
man affairs ; but they are heathen Greek, or, if you will, flat 
nonsense, when addressed to those new fledged statesmen, who 
are always positive and peremptory in proportion to their ignorance of politics. But even if we should suppose, that by 
miracle the men of a day should be imbued with the important truths, which it is necessary to the peace and happiness of 
society that its rulers should be acquainted with, still we are a 
great, and I might say, an immense distance from the object. 
Before the people will assent to the form of government, 
which in hypothesis shall be supposed the most fitting for 
them, they must be convinced of the fitness. No easy task, 
believe me ; even if man were a reasonable creature, but he 
is not. He is a creature of sense, and governed invariably by 
his feelings. Now you can easily make him feel, that in point 
of right he is equal to every other man. Vanity may even 
whisper to him that he is so in point of talent, and if vanity wedb remiss, the prompter flattery is at hand. But the more 
he feels his equality of rights and talents, the more must he 
feel his inequality in point of possessions. Where these are 
wanting, he has rights which he cannot exercise, talents which 
he cannot employ, desires which he cannot gratify, and, in 
consequence, resentments which he cannot allay. 
</p><p>
Now the severe law of property is, that in any well settled 
country a few must soon possess all, and the majority, the 
great majority, nothing. Between that economy, which constitutes the tyranny of the rich, and that misery which en 
slaves the poor, let the form of government be what it may, 
there is a constant struggle which forms great men, and great 
men are generally ambitious men. Their equals in property 
are as much enslaved by their pleasures, as the poorer kinds, 
can possibly be by their wants. In such a state of things, 
where the constitution is not balanced in its structure, and 
supported by strong props of private interest, it must be 
overturned. I quit these investigations to tell you, that all 
here is in a state of uncertainty. Time will disclose the 
events with which he is charged in their due season. Some 
of them I think will be of sable hue. I am, &LC.
