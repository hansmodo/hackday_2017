Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a>, who will have the honour of delivering 
you this letter, is on his way to South Carolina, on a project 
w r hich I think, in the present situation of affairs there, is a 
very good one, and deserves every kind of support and 
encouragement. This is to raise two, three, or four battalions of negroes, with the assistance of the government of 
that State, by contributions from the owners, in proportion 
to the number they possess. If you should think proper to 
enter upon the subject with him, he will give you a detail 
of his plan. He wishes to have it recommended by Congress to the State ; and, as an inducement, that they would 
engage to take those battalions into continental pay. 
</p><p>
It appears to me that an expedient of this kind, in the 
present state of southern affairs, is the most rational that 
can be adopted, and promises very important advantages. 
Indeed, I hardly see how a sufficient force can be collected 
in that quarter without it ; and the enemy's operations there 
are growing infinitely serious and formidable. I have not 
the least doubt that the negroes will make very excellent 
soldiers with proper management; and I will venture to 
pronounce that they cannot be put into better hands than 
those of Mr. Laurens. He has all the zeal, intelligence, 
enterprise, and every other qualification necessity to succeed in such an undertaking. It is a maxim with some 
great military judges, that with sensible officers, soldiers 
can hardly be too stupid ; and, on this principle, it is thought 
that the Russians would make the best troops in the world, 
if they were under other officers than their own. The King 
of Prussia is among the number who maintain this doctrine, 
and has a very emphatical saying on the occasion, which I 
do not exactly recollect. I mention this, because I hear it 
frequently objected to the scheme of imbodying negroes, 
that they nre too stupid to make soldiers. This is so far 
from appearing to me a valid objection, that I think their 
want of cultivation (for their natural faculties are probably 
as good as ours), joined to that habit of subordination, which 
they acquire from a life of servitude, will make them sooner 
become soldiers than our white inhabitants. Let oificers 
be men of sense and sentiment, and the nearer the soldiers 
approach to machines, perhaps the better. 
</p><p>
I foresee that this project will have to combat much 
opposition from prejudice and self-interest. The contempt 
we have been taught to entertain for the blacks, makes us 
fancy many things that are founded neither in reason nor 
experience ; and an unwillingness to part with property of 
so valuable a kind, will furnish a thousand arguments to 
show the impracticability, or pernicious tendency, of a 
scheme which requires such a sacrifice. But it should be 
considered, that if we do not make use of them in this way, 
the enemy probably will ; and that the best way to counteract the temptations they will hold out, will be to offer 
them ourselves. An essential part of the plan is to give 
them their freedom with their muskets. This will secure 
their fidelity, animate their courage, and, I believe, will 
have a good influence upon those who remain, by opening a 
door to their emancipation. This circumstance, I confess, 
has no small weight in inducing me to wish the success of 
the project ; for the dictates of humanity and true policy 
equally interest me in favour of this unfortunate class of men. 
With the truest respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
I am, sir your most obedient servant,
