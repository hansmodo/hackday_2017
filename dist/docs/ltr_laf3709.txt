My dear General, 
</p><p>
My official letter, a copy of which I send to Congress, will let you know the situation of affairs in 
this quarter. I ardently wish my conduct may meet 
with your approbation. Had I followed the first impulse of my temper, I would have risked something 
more. But I have been guarding against my own 
warmth; and this consideration, that a general defeat, 
which, with such a proportion of militia, must be expected, would involve This State and our affairs in 
ruin, has rendered me extremely cautious in my 
movements. Indeed, I am more embarrassed to move, 
more crippled in my projects, than we have been in 
the Northern States. 
</p><p>
Had the Pennsylvanians arrived before Lord Cornwallis, I was determined to attack the enemy, and 
have no doubt but what we should have been successful. Their unaccountable delay cannot be too 
much lamented, and will make an immense difference 
in the fate of this campaign. Should they have arrived time enough to support me in the reception of 
Lord Cornwallis's first stroke, I should still have 
thought it well enough ; but, from an answer of <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a>, received this day, and dated the 19th, 
I am afraid that at this moment they have hardly 
left Yorktown.-' 
</p><p>
Public stores and private property being removed 
from <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, this place is a less important object. 
I do not believe it would be prudent to expose the 
troops for the sake of a few houses, most of which 
are empty. But I am wavering between two inconveniences. Were I to fight a battle, I should be cut 
to pieces, the militia dispersed, and the arms lost. 
Were I to decline fighting, the country would think 
herself given up. I am, therefore, determined to skirmish, but not to engage too far; and particularly to 
take care against their immense and excellent body 
of horse, which the militia fear as they would so 
many wild beasts. 
</p><p>
A letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> to General Sumner 
is dated May 5th, seven miles below Camden. The 
Baron is going to him with some recruits, and will 
get some more in North Carolina. When the Pennsylvanians come, I am only to keep them a few days, 
which I will improve as well as I can. Cavalry is 
very necessary to us. I wish Lauzun's legion could 
come. I am sure he will like to serve with me; and as <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> gave me command of the troops 
in this State, Lauzun might remain with me in Virginia ; if not, Sheldon's dragoons might he sent. As 
to Mojlan, I do not believe he will be ready before a long time. 
</p><p>
Were I any ways equal to the enemy, I should be 
extremely happy in my present command ; but I am 
not strong enough even to get beaten. Government, 
in this State, has no energy, and laws have no force. 
But I hope this Assembly will put matters upon a 
better footing. I had a great deal of trouble to put 
the departments in a tolerable train. Our expenses 
were enormous ; and yet we can get nothing. Arrangements, for the present, seem to put on a better 
face, but for this superiority of the enemy, who will 
chase us wherever they please. They can overrun 
the country ; and, until the Pennsylvanians arrive, we 
are next to nothing in point of opposition to so large 
a force. This country begins to be as familiar to me 
as Tappan and Bergen. Our soldiers are hitherto 
very healthy, and I have turned doctor to regulate 
their diet. Adieu, my dear General. Let me hear 
sometimes from you. Your letters are a great happiness to your affectionate friend,

P. S. As I am for the present fixed in the command of the troops in this State, I beg it as a great 
favor that you will please to send me Colonel Gouvion. Should a junction be made with <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>, 
he will act as my Aid-de-camp. My respects, if you 
please, to Mrs. Washington, and compliments to the 
family.
