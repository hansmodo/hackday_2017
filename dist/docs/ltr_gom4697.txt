My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I send you herewith a duplicate of my last letter, in the close 
of which I mention my adherence to the opinions expressed in 
my last. But on recurring to my private letter book, which 
was not then before me, I find that the letter I there alluded to 
was written on the eighteenth of October. It went by Captain Culver, and has, I hope, arrived in due season. Every 
day confirms what is contained in that letter ; but parties are 
so balanced, and .the impending force from abroad is in such 
threatening attitude^ that the present state of things drags on 
its existence rather from surrounding circumstances than from 
internal vigor. And strange as it may seem, the impending 
change may arise from a victory, or from a defeat, or from a 
famine.

The gazettes tell us that Mr Jefferson is coming to Europe ; 
some of them say as my successor ; others say it is a secret 
mission. I have heard it said that he is to negotiate a peace 
among the belligerent powers. For my own part, I hold in 
politics the opinions which prevail in physics among sound 
philosophers, viz. that it is proper to determine facts before we 
attempt to discover causes. I wait therefore patiently the 
event. Major Jackson, who has been here for some time, 
gave me two successors ; first, Mr Bingham, and then Mr Pinckney ; giving in the latter case Mr Pinckney's place to 
Mr Bingham. So it is easy, you see, to fill up vacancies.

The probable events of the campaign about to open, are not 
favorable to the French Republic. It will be extremely difficult for them to subsist the armies needful for their defence, 
and the extreme severity exercised by the present government 
will, in case of adverse events, excite a universal insurrection. 
At present, the people are restrained by fear from showing any 
sentiment unfavorable to the existent authorities, but as is usual in like circumstances, should that fear be removed, it will be 
succeeded by sharp resentments. If, however, the armies of 
the Republic should prove successful, they would, in my opinion, be the first to overturn the Convention ; for such is the 
usual course of things. A terrible perspective this, my dear 
Sir, for those who are at present in the saddle ; no wonder, 
therefore, if they ride hard. It is not the least of their misfortunes to be fully sensible of their situation ; and it results there 
fore, that as much time is consumed in providing for their de 
fence against adverse factions and contingent events, as in pre 
paring for the general defence of the country ; more perhaps.

How different "was our situation in America. Every one 
performed cheerfully his part, nor had we anything to apprehend but from the common enemy. Such is the immense 
difference between a country which has morals, and one which 
is corrupted. The former has everything to hope, and the 
latter everything to fear. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear Sir; may God in heaven bless, and pre 
serve, and prosper you.
