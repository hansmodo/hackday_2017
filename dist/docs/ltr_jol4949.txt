My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
The moment Mr Boudinot returned from German 
Town where he had a conference with Mr Loring, 
British comm 7 of prisoners, upon the subject of an 
exchange. He brings us intelligence that the com 
missioners appointed by act of Parliament to divide 
us by governor's places, &ca., skilfully dealt, are ar 
rived ; that they are, as we had heard L'd <a href='/results.php?city=carlisle' rel='city'>Carlisle</a>, 
Gov. Johnston, and Mr Eden; that L'd Cornwallis 
is come with them. A spy of ours who left the city 
this morning says, that they landed at 2 o clock yesterday afternoon, and that they came up the river in 
barges ; that five or six hundred sailors had come up 
to the city in boats, and were assembled at the proper 
place for conducting the passage of the troops; that 
no ships remained near the town except the Vigilant 
and <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, who seem destined to cover the cross 
ing, and that all the enemy's sick are removed. 
</p><p>
Some people are of opinion that the arrival of the 
commissioners at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> is a proof that war is 
not yet declared between England and France ; the 
former determining to try what may be done with 
respect to America, by the means of negotiation, 
and preferring in the mean time a suffering of inconveniences and insults, to engage at once in so unequal 
a contest ; and that the commissioners have ventured 
to land in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> from a persuasion that a 
declaration of war will not originate with France. 
</p><p>
It is certain that the commissioners must know 
whether war is declared, and it appears to me almost 
certain that they would not come to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> if 
it were. At all events I imagine the arrival of the 
commissioners will delay the final evacuation of the 
city till a council of war can be held, and perhaps 
some message sent to Congress. It would be an 
awkward appearance for them to arrive at Philadel 
phia with a view of proposing terms of conciliation, 
and to change their ground without announcing them 
selves. But it w'd be full as awkward and disgrace 
ful for them to announce themselves and disappear 
before an answer from Congress could be given. 
All which inclines me to believe that war was not 
declared at the time they left England, and that their 
stay will be deferred by their court as long as pos 
sible. A deserter who is just arrived, says that none 
but the light troops remained in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. Orders had been given for their preparing every thing 
for moving, but the arrival of the commissioners had 
occasioned a countermand. 
</p><p>
Our treaty with France is known ; what the commissioners can hope from their act of Parliament, 
which is an insult to our honour and understanding, I cannot conceive. Commissary Loring told Mr Boudinot with a grave face, that a fleet of forty ships had 
sailed from the British coast and struck such an alarm in the minds of the French king and his ministers as occasioned them to desire the immediate departure of <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='co-worker'>Dr. Franklin</a>, &ca. 
</p><p>
This express was ordered immediately on Mr. Boudinot's return, that Congress may he apprised, 
and have time to deliberate even before the commissioners announce themselves. I have written in 
the greatest hurry, and thrown a chaos of words together. 
</p><p>
I have barely time to acknowledge the receipt of 
your letter of the 5th . Mr. Conway's conduct irritates 
but does not surprise me. The truth of the matter 
with respect to his resignation is, that he expected to 
have been solicited to remain in the service, and to 
have made a great bustle, and increased his importance. As for fighting, I know by what I saw at 
German Town, that his stomach is not so keen set 
for it as he pretends ; but his friends, Gates and Mifflin, sacrificed him at a time when he least expected 
it. However, he has fairly undone himself, and will 
be treated with that contempt which he deserves. 
I shall take the liberty of communicating this matter 
to the general. 
</p><p>
I must beg the favour of you to send by the earliest 
opportunity, a copy of the last resolves of Congress 
relative to the exchange of prisoners, the 21'st ult. 
It has been mislaid here, and the person who had the 
care of it wishes to avoid the wound to his sensibility 
which w'd arise from having the matter applied for 
officially with an explanation. 
</p><p>
God preserve you, my dear father.
