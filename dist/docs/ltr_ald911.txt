IT IS with a kind of desperation that I seize the pen this morning as an antidote to ennui. The miners have been mostly frightened away by a succession of stormy weather, rain in the valleys and snow on the mountains; and I am also preparing to evacuate these diggings in two or three days. I shall remove to the mouth of the creek four miles below, where about two hundred and fifty men are preparing winter quarters where, by the appearance of the trees, the snow falls forty or fifty feet deep.
</p><p>
The miners who are left here are all out at work, and I went out and rocked the cradle an hour or so for pastime, and got only twenty-five cents; so I gave it up, and not to let the time hang heavily on my hands, I take up my pen to make you pay a postage to Uncle Samuel, who never refuses such contributions, although his boys may grumble sometimes at having to make them. I shall return to the Valley as soon as I dispose of my traps, and then I have several operations in view. I generally succeed better at hard work than in mining, and I have discovered, after an outlay of two
thousand dollars, that my steamboat force and horsepower is not equal to the labor of digging and sweltering in the sun. I have talked so much of scenery that people must be tired of it; but Heaven knows that if they had a spice of my disposition, they would never weary in looking at what there is around us here. Eight miles from here is an old volcano I had a fair view of it yesterday, and before I go to the Valley I shall visit it. At its base is the richest deposit yet found in this vicinity. If I could get ropes and the right men to handle them I would see what there is inside--that is, I would go into it as far as I could and be pulled out again; I'll have a peep anyhow. I am cogitating a subject for one of these days, but I want to go below first--I mean "the present state of California."
</p><p>
I think when the sufferings of the emigrants both on the plains and after their arrival is known at home, our people will begin to see California stripped of her gaudy robes, her paint and outward adornments, which have been so liberally heaped upon her by thoughtless letter-writers and culpable editors, and they will be content to stay at home and reap their own grain, and enjoy the comforts which they really possess, rather than come here to starve or pick up what would be thrown from their own tables at home to satisfy the cravings of hunger. The greatness of California! Faugh! Great for what and for whom? Great at present as an outlet to a portion of the surplus wheat, pork and clothes, blacklegs, prostitutes and vicious at home, and for the would-be politicians of the country and the ultras who quarrel over us in Washington. Oregon will be the greatest of the two, and here is another theme. She will have more wealth in time by selling her potatoes to us at five dollars per bushel, her lumber at thirty dollars per M, her flour, her pork, and soon her woolens, her leather, &c., &c., than we shall have with all our mines. If I was a politician (thank God I am not ), I would gather statistics enough to satisfy any political economist on this subject.
</p><p>
I am a little curious to learn what effect a residence in California has had upon that portion of emigrants who have returned, whether they have as easily relapsed into steady habits again when surrounded by the moral influences of our old country, as they (not all, be it understood) fell into the snares of vice without any such restraint here. Could not we get up some tall lectures on what we have seen--eh? The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by that most beautiful of all writers, Gibbon, or the rise and progress of Mormonism, couldn't hold a candle to it; it's the subject I mean, not our style or descriptive powers.
</p><p>
It is noon and near dinnertime. Will you join me? Don't fear a griddle-cake infliction. No, no, just a plain family dinner--fried
potatoes and ham. I made some gingerbread yesterday--all but the ginger (that I couldn't get)--it's good, too, and that shall be our dessert. Will you have a glass of wine?--just bring it along, for I haven't got it; but there is chocolate enough left from my breakfast to warm over again. Come, boys, move that monte bank off the table; the Colonel and I want to dine. Hardy, drive that mule out of the tent; let him wait till we get through. There, Colonel, scrape off that old cigar, take that keg and go your death. Pshaw! Colonel, don't pick your teeth with the fork; take your bowie knife. What's the use of being so effeminate? Now, tumble down on my mattress and take a siesta, while I talk to the boys.
</p><p>
I have been sketching a little since I have been here, and succeed in getting correct outlines much better than I hoped for; but no pencil can do justice to the sublime scenery of the mountains. You shall have an impress of the Middle Fork volcano If in going into it I meet old Pluto, I will get a description of the infernal regions, and if I find him in a communicative humor, I will ask him to explain the cause of the "mysterious knockings" which are bothering brother Greeley and many other wise ones at home. I wish I was rich enough to stop work. I would just make one grand tour through this mountain range, for you not only get one magnificent view but you see a hill ahead that you long to be on for the sake of another. Once there, something new, varied and grand entices you on like an ignis fatuus, so that there seems no end, and you are compelled to remain unsatisfied--as I am to wind up for want of paper.
