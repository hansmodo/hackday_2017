I have received your letter of the 9th from Arlington.  I had supposed
you were at Ravensworth....  I am glad to hear that you are at peace,
and enjoying the sweet weather and beautiful flowers.  You had better
complete your arrangements and retire further from the scene of war.
It may burst upon you at any time.  It is sad to think of the
devastation, if not ruin, it may bring upon a spot so endeared to us.
But God's will be done.  We must be resigned.  May He guard and keep
you all, is my constant prayer.
