Sir, 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor to acknowledge the receipt 
of your Excellency's letter of the 20th instant, from 
which I have the pleasure to observe the progress you 
make in the march of the troops under your command, 
and your intentions to come to my camp in person 
from <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>. Be assured, Sir, I shall be very happy 
to see you whenever you arrive. You do not mention the route by which you intend to come. You 
will find me at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. My intelligence from the 
southward is too vague and uncertain to communicate 
to your Excellency. By the time of your arrival, I 
hope to be able to give you some certain information 
of our situation in that quarter. I am, &,c. 
</p>
