Dear General, 
</p><p>
You will doubtless learn before this can reach you, that Congress has adjourned without making any adequate provision for the formation of a 
Government or the establishment of our laws in California. It is greatly deplored by moderate men of all parties that nothing has been done to 
meet the wants of that country, now filling rapidly up with a hardy and enterprising population, and among the most important duties presented to the 
administration is that of facilitating and hastening by all the legitimate means at its command, the organization of a state government in California 
with a view to the establishment of law and order in that country and its early admission into the Union. 
</p><p>
In the absence of a civil government, it will doubtless be in your power as senior officer of the troops quartered in California to do much in promoting an end so desirable, not only to the people 
of that country, but for particular reasons, to all well-wishers of the Union at home. The Government confidently relies upon your well-known 
patriotism to exert in that behalf the influence which your reputation, your abilities and high character cannot fail to give you. 
</p><p>
This letter will be handed you by the Hon. T. Butler King, who has been employed by the government to proceed to California for the 
purpose of collecting statistical information to to encourage the speedy organization of a government and the adoption of necessary laws for the 
protection of life and property. Mr. King is too well and favorably known to render it necessary for me to recommend him personally to your 
kind attention. He will confer with you in regard to the objects of his mission and I have to request that you will furnish him and his party such escorts 
and transportation as he may require in moving from place to place, and afford him generally every aid and facility in your power that may assist him 
in carrying out the instructions of the Government. 
</p><p>
We are anxious to hear of the safe arrival of Mrs. Smith and yourself in California and hope you will find the climate & country agreeable. 
We were gratified to see that you had reached Acapulco and other Mexican ports without accident. 
</p><p>
With my kind regards to your lady and best wishes for yourself, 
</p><p>
I remain Yrs. very truly, 
</p><p>
