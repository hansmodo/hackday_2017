Received from the Honourable Richard Corbin, Esq., His Majesty's Receiver- General, 330, as a compensation for the Gunpowder lately taken out 
of the public Magazine by the Governour's order ; which money I promise to convey to the Virginia Delegates at the General Congress, to be under their 
direction laid out in Gunpowder for the Colony's use, and to be stored as they shall direct, until the next Colony Convention, or General Assembly, unless it shall be necessary, in the mean time to use 
the same in defence of this Colony. It is agreed, that in case the next Convention shall determine that any part of the said money ought to be returned to His Majesty's Receiver-General, that the 
same shall be done accordingly.
