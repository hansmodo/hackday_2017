MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
WE have been three days soaking and poaching in the 
heaviest rain that has been known for several years. 
</p><p>
I am in comfortable lodgings, which is a felicity 
that has fallen to the lot of a very few of our members. Yet the house where I am is so thronged, that 
I cannot enjoy such accommodations as I wish. I 
cannot have a room as I used, and therefore cannot 
find opportunities to write as I once did. 
</p><p>
The people of this country are chiefly Germans, 
who have schools in their own language, as well as 
prayers, psalms, and sermons, so that multitudes 
are born, grow up and die here, without ever learning 
the English. In politics they are a breed of mongrels or neutrals, and benumbed with a general torpor. If 
the people in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and 
Jersey had the feelings and the spirit of some people 
that I know, Howe would be soon ensnared in a trap 
more fatal than that in which, as it is said, Burgoyne 
was taken. Howe is completely in our power, and if 
he is not totally ruined, it will be entirely owing to 
the awkwardness and indolence of this country. 
Fighting, however, begins to become fashionable. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=chg' rel=''>Colonel Greene</a> has exhibited a glorious example in 
the defence of Red Bank. But this must be done by 
a New England man at the head of two New England regiments, Rhode Islanders. Colonel Smith, 
however, is a Marylander from <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>. He has 
shown another example of magnanimity which gives 
me the most agreeable hopes. Commodore Hazel- 
wood, too, has behaved in a manner that exceeds all 
praise. This spirit will be caught by other officers, for 
bravery is epidemical and contagious as the plague. 
This army suffers much for want of blankets and shoes. 
I celebrated the 25th of this month in my own 
mind and heart much more than I shall the 30th,be 
cause I think the first a more fortunate day than the 
last. My duty to your father and my mother, to uncles and aunts. Love to brothers and sisters ; but 
above all, present all the affection that words can express to our dear babes.
