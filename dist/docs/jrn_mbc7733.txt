Misery upon misery. Mobile is going as New Orleans went. Those Western men have not held their towns as we 
held and hold Charleston, or as the Virginians hold Richmond. And they call us a " frill-shirt, silk-stocking chivalry," or " a set of dandy Miss Nancys." They fight desperately in their bloody street brawls, but we bear privation 
and discipline best.
