SIR, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of writing to your Excellency the 
24th instant, by McKlosky. Yesterday, about half 
past 5 o clock, P. M., your Excellency's favor of the 
25th was brought to me in Congress, and was immediately presented. The person who had been the 
bearer of it was anxious to obtain a receipt of the 
letter to express the time of delivery, and he complained of unnecessary detention half the day at the 
Suscjuehanna Ferry. This intimation will answer his 
purpose. 
</p><p>
I am directed, by Congress, to request your Excellency will immediately require all officers, civil as well 
as military, in the army, who are at present delinquent, to comply with the terms of an act of Congress 
of the 3d of February last, by taking the oath of 
allegiance and abjuration, and that your Excellency 
will be pleased to cause the necessary certificates as 
speedily as possible to be returned, and if occasion 
shall be given, which is supposed to be scarcely possible, the name or names of such persons as shall 
refuse. 
</p><p>
The bearer hereof will deliver three packets, containing about six hundred blanks, which will hasten 
the business of administering oaths. More shall be 
sent by the next messenger. 
</p><p>
In considering the article of provision to be made for officers, who shall continue in the army to the end 
of the war, Congress had proceeded so far last night 
as resolving, that one half the present pay be continued during life, without exceptions of country, to 
all such officers as shall also take the oath of allegiance, and actually reside within the United States. 
This resolution, and the whole plan for the military establishment, is subject to further discussion, respecting the propriety of transmitting it to the several 
States for concurrence. I have the honor to be, with 
the highest respect and esteem, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hel" rel="me">HENRY LAURENS</a>, President.
