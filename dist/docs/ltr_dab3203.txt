DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your favor of the 4th of January, and the 14th of March. That of the 4th of 
January I did not receive until the 18th instant. 
Returns of the troops under my command have been 
duly forwarded to the orderly office, agreeably to 
general orders, except one or two months in the winter, when the mountain was impassable. As no reenforcement can be had from your Excellency, the 
intended expedition against Detroit must be laid 
aside until a favorable turn of affairs takes place, unless you would recommend a junction of Colonel Clark's troops with mine. 
</p><p>
I have called upon the different counties, on this 
side the mountain, for eight hundred and twenty-five 
rank and file, to be drafted from the militia, and in 
tend to visit the Shawanese, provided the men are 
furnished. But the unhappy dispute of jurisdiction 
will, I fear, prevent my getting them ; and, as many 
renegadoes from the different Indian nations are collected at the Shawanese towns, I do not incline to 
make an attempt with an inconsiderable number of 
men, because a defeat would be attended with fatal 
consequences to the settlement. 
</p><p>
I am honored with a line from the Honorable 
Board of War, informing me that an officer of Colonel Proctor's regiment; with some stores and cannon, was 
in readiness to be sent up as soon as the roads 
would permit^ and the means of transportation can be 
procured. 
</p><p>
Mr. Arthur Gordon has deserted from his arrest,, 
and will probably avoid a new trial. 
</p><p>
With a view of saving land-carriage expenses, when 
water-carriage was practicable, I suffered only a few 
of the boats to be used ; and greater care could 
scarcely have been taken, than what I took, to prevent their being lost or spoiled; but it was out of 
my power to watch every person. 1 have, however, 
the pleasure to assure you, that not more than seven 
are past Fort Henry, which, as I have given orders 
to some of Colonel Clark's officers, will, I trust, be 
saved and sent back to this post. 
</p><p>
I was much inclined, last fall, to do myself the 
honor of waiting upon your Excellency, with a view 
of proposing some things which, at that time, I expected would have promoted the service in this district in the course of this campaign; but I do not 
recollect that I expressed my desire to visit my 
family. I am much obliged to your Excellency for 
the indulgence; but, as Colonel Gibson is absent on a 
visit to his family, at <a href='/results.php?city=carlisle' rel='city'>Carlisle</a>, and the Indians are 
remarkably hostile, I must remain, until I see whether it will be in my power to prosecute an expedition against the hostile Indians, or not, and until I 
have the honor of hearing from you again. 
</p><p>
The Lieutenants of Monongalia county, and Ohio, 
write, that they arc happy to hear of the intended 
expedition against some of the hostile Indians, and 
that they will exert themselves to furnish the men 
required; but they conceive that it will be difficult to 
effect it, on account of the disputed territory. 
I take the liberty to inclose the copy of a letter, 
lately received from the Delaware Council at Coochocking, number One ; likewise a copy of the Reve 
rend Mr. Heckewelder's letter, number Two ; and an 
extract from the Reverend Mr. Heckewelder's letter, 
number Three and I will likewise inclose the return 
of the troops, as nearly as possible, to your wish ; 
but as Colonel Gibson's regiment, my own, and the 
independent corps, were chiefly raised within the disputed territory, it will be impossible to determine in 
which State they were raised, until the line is run. 
</p><p>
Fearing a scarcity of salt provisions for the out 
posts, and the better to enable me to subsist a number of the militia upon the proposed expedition, I 
have been obliged to reduce the ration of meat one quarter, but I have allowed some Indian meal in lieu thereof. Since the 1st of March, the Indians have 
killed and taken forty-three men, women, and children, in the counties of Youghiogany, Monongalia, and 
Ohio, including those killed and taken upon the river ; 
and they have destroyed a number of horses and 
cattle in Tiger Valley. 
</p><p>
The Honorable Board of War mention the expense 
of expresses in such a manner, as must prevent my 
employing any ; but I will do myself the honor to 
communicate to you every material occurrence, by such 
private conveyance as may from time to time offer. 
I have the honor to be, with the most sincere respect 
and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
