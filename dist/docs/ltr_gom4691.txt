My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In a newspaper of this day I find the translation of your 
message of the fifth of December to Congress, and observe, 
that after stating the violation of the treaty by a decree of the 
National Convention, you tell them I have been instructed to 
make representations on the subject. 
</p><p>
Now this, my dear Sir, is the first I hear, and all I know 
of such instructions. Indeed I have received no letters, news 
papers, or other intelligence from America, since those which 
Captain Culver brought. I suppose this arises from the difficulty of communication ; but whatever be the cause, I feel 
the effect. It would be of some use if a clerk in the office of 
Foreign Affairs had by triplicates mentioned from time to 
time which of my letters were received. Thus on the present occasion, I should know whether my correspondence with 
the Minister on the subject of this obnoxious decree was be 
fore you. 
</p><p>
As it is, not being able to determine the nature of the representations, which you have desired me to make, I am 
obliged to be silent. And unless more than one copy has 
been sent, I may never receive your orders, and at any rate it 
will be at no early day. I am sure it is superfluous to tell 
you, how painful it is for a person in my situation to be totally 
ignorant of what passes in his own country, and whether the 
conduct which, under circumstances continually changing, he 
finds it necessary to pursue, does, or does not consist with the 
views of government. Blaming a wrong step would prevent 
a repetition of it ; but really at present I walk in the dark, or 
at best by the feeble light of my own conjectures. 
</p><p>
I know not whether my brethren have the same dearth of 
intelligence. Mr Short complained of it much when I last 
saw him, and has since mentioned the same thing from Madrid, so that I conclude the evil to arise from the negligence 
of those to whom letters are entrusted. Might it not be advisable to send every month a small packet to Europe ? 
They might come alternately to Havre and Lisbon, and that 
which arrives at Lisbon come on thence to Havre, that which 
arrives at Havre go from thence to Lisbon. In this way a 
regular correspondence would be kept up, and by seizing for inimportant communications the private conveyances which offer, 
full intelligence would be given and received. Six packets 
would be amply sufficient for the service, and if, as I believe, 
small schooners could be safely employed, the prime cost 
would not be above three thousand pounds sterling, and the annual expense, I should suppose, not more than half of that sum. 
</p><p>
I beg your pardon, my dear Sir, for troubling you with this 
groaning epistle. I will not say one word of news, as in supposeable circumstances it might prevent this letter from reaching you. I adhere to the opinions expressed in my last. 
Adieu.
