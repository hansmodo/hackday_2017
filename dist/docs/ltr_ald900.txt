--On regaining the road and ascending a high hill, the Valley of the Sacramento lay before me, five or six miles distant. I could discern green trees and a level bottom, but the day was too smoky for an extended view."
</p><p>
There are trees, and occasionally groves, but in nearly every instance they are on the banks of the stream, or on soil that is subject to being overflowed by the winter floods, or where sloughs or wet places moisten the earth sufficiently to afford sap to sustain their growth. The trees in the Valley are of the stunted growth; you can
scarcely find one of eighteen inches in diameter that is sound at the butt or fit for staves. They are often large at the butt and branch out to an enormous distance, but do not grow tall and thrifty, as we see them in the mountains or at home.
</p><p>
In immediate proximity to the streams, the soil appears fertile, and good crops of wheat can be raised if the land can be irrigated. But three or four miles from the stream, unless in the vicinity of sloughs, the grass is dry and crisp by August, and where any attempt is made at farming, deep trenches are dug around the field, from some creek, to irrigate the dry and parched soil. I have not seen any as large potatoes here even as is common at home, and they can grow only in the neighborhood of streams.

Extract 2.--"For some miles after reaching the Valley the ground was covered with round stone and debris which appeared to have been originally thrown out by some volcano, and then washed by floods to their present place of deposit."
</p><p>
I say without hesitation, let no man come here for agricultural speculation while there is a corner left between the Alleghenies and the Platte. The soil is no better than the prairies of Indiana, Illinois and Missouri, while rain rarely falls between June and November.

In speaking of the salubrity of the climate, Mr. Bryant says (I quote from memory) that "the purity of the air is such that dead carcasses of animals emit no offensive smell
</p><p>
This may be so on the Coast, for I have not yet been there; but unless Mr. B.'s olfactory nerves are hopelessly disordered, he must be convinced by this time that it will not apply to the Valley of the Sacramento. The stench around Sacramento City in September and October was almost insufferable, arising from putrid carcasses of mules and oxen that had perished in the mire of the slough on the north side of the city, and nowhere in the Valley where I have been, have I found it different in this respect from the States. So far as my observation extends I should judge that five sixths of the emigrants from the States have suffered from sickness--bloody flux, diarrhea, and chills and fever, and I have been told by those who have lived here three and four years that they are subject to the same diseases. This must always be so, for the fervid heat of the summer sun produces rapid decay of vegetable and animal matter along the low grounds, and the cold nights are on the other extreme, which no prudence can obviate. I never saw so much suffering and misery from disease in all my life as I have seen during a five months' residence in California.
</p><p>
A great share of those who arrived in the Valley and the mines in good health were, more or less, stricken by disease, and I could give you many heart-rending individual cases. It is more than an even
chance that every emigrant must be sick after his arrival. No doubt exposure and bad diet contribute much in producing disease, but the very nature of the climate, the extremes between the heat of the day and the cold night air, must make it unhealthy. You may lay down in the evening without a rag of covering over you, and before morning you may be shivering in your blanket in August. In summer, many of the mountain streams are dry, and in going down the Valley from Lawson's to Sacramento City, the traveler often suffers for water, and sometimes when he finds it, it is in a mud hole, warm and unpalatable, so that a flowing creek is looked upon as a gem. I append a table of distances from Lawson's to the city (by general estimation) on the road, which I made in passing down, showing where grass and water was found last September:
</p><p>
So you see that you have to travel long distances for water in the season you need it most. As for the clearness of the atmosphere, it
may vary, for aught I know, but I give you another extract from my journal:
