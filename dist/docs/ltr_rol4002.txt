Dear John, 
</p><p>
I have just now heard that you are upon the point of 
leaving us. I might have expected to have received this 
intelligence from yourself, rather than from loose report, 
since there is scarce a transaction in the world in which I 
feel myself more interested. I rejoice at it as it advances 
your fortune and reputation. I lament it, as it adds to the 
losses I have already felt in the course of this war, that of 
a friend whom I had sense enough to value, even before 
age had ripened my judgment, and whom an after acquaintance with the world has taught me to think inestimable. I 
call it a loss, for I have but little prospect of seeing you 
here again. You will now move in a more enlarged 
sphere, and will hardly think of recrossing the Atlantic, till 
the blood runs too slowly in our veins to keep up the 
ardour of friendship. I was going- to give you a long 
detail of State politics, but they are now unworthy your 
attention. Besides that, I by no means feel myself disposed 
at this moment to view them in any other than the most contemptible light, or to execrate them for detaining me here, 
when I so ardently wish to receive your last adieu. When 
do you embark, and where 1 If from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, tell me when 
to meet you at <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>, and perhaps (if the Legislature adjourn) to accompany you. If this pleasure is denied me, 
believe that you and yours are attended by every tender 
wish which the sincerest friendship can dictate. I will not 
wrong you so much as to ask you to omit no occasion of 
lessening the pain I feel in your absence, by writing to me 
by every conveyance ; your own heart has and will for 
ever suggest that thought. Adieu, my dear John ; 
</p><p>
May you be as happy as I wish you,
