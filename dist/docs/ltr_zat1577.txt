My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Since I wrote you on the 12th  or 13th  ins t in reply to yours of the 
1 8th  & 25th  ult we have had no arrivals from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a>, the 28th  of last 
month being our latest dates from that place, & II th 12th  since any arrival 
from the city, which seems to me quite a long time, more particularly 
during the prevailing epidemic as I have so much to apprehend on your 
account who is constantly in contact with it, as well as that of Mr s Taylor, 
Ann, Betty & girls who may come over before it is entirely safe to do so ; 
but I hope they will not attempt it while there is the remotest danger to 
be apprehended from contageon or disease of any kind at the Barracks, in 
the city or at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> ; should they come over, & the epidemic should 
make its appearance contrary to expectation & it is healthy at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> I 
hope Ann & the girls will go up with Mr s T. & Betty & remain with them 
until you have two or three white frosts, sufficient to destroy every vestag 
of the epidemic, which has prevailed during the sumer & autumn ; which 
I presume has pretty much subsided by this time, as it was very much on 
the decline when you last wrote; & I presume the city is beginning once 
more to fill up by the returning inhabitants as well as strangers ; especially 
if you have had any thing like frost which is usually the case about this 
time or a little before. If so I hope Mrs Taylor will soon be safely 
located at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> & Ann & the two girls with her, or with you, & out 
of danger at the Barracks

I have not heard any of the particulars as regards <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a>s taking 
possession of the City of Mexico, all we have heard relative to that affair, 
is that he was in quiet possession of that place, & the Mexican army had 
dispersed ; & I presume there will hardly be any other battle ; that Santa 
Anna had gone no one knew wher, in the direction the Pacific, & it was 
supposed he would leave the country ; this is Mexican news, & Mexican 
conjecture. I make no doubt however you have ere this, had all the par 
ticulars, connected with that affair, as we get everything of importance 
from that portion of the army which can be relied on, by the way of N. 
Orleans ; I presume a treaty of some kind or other will grow out of our 
taking the city, & laying it under contribution, which the Mexicans say 
has been done ; & should we acquire any considerable quantity of territory, it will produce great strife in the Senate, whenever such a treaty is 
laid before that body for their action ; the Wilmot proviso will shake that 
body to its center, & how it is all to end, time must determine ; but I 
hope some compromise will be entered into between the two parties 
slavery & anti slavery which will have the effect of allaying violent passions on both sides which will have the effect of perpetuating instead of 
wrecking or shortening the Union

Judging from some of the newspapers received here by the last mail, 
in addition to a private letter addressed to me by a prominent whig, evidently to prepare me for such an event & intimating that it would be 
expected that I would acquiesce in the same should it be done, to bring 
Mr Clay again before the country as a candidat for the presidency; in 
which I observe some of his bitterest defamers at the last election, was 
lending their aid to bring about such an event ; their object being to 
divide & sow dissentions among the whig party, which if they can succeed 
in doing, will insure the election of one of their own way of thinking ; 
how far Mr Clay has or will countenance such a movement, I am unable 
to say, & am not so certain but what he has given it his countenance, if 
not his sanction ; for contrary to his usual bold & frank action in all such 
matters, he has been unusually reserved on this subject, which satisfies me 
he is holding or keeping aloof so as to be able to take advantage of circumstances ; evidently still desiring the office ; & it seems to me more 
anxious for office than for the interest of the country, or the success of 
the whig party ; I have not answered letter referred to, or others I have 
received from various individuals in regard to this matter, nor shall I do 
so ; for while it is to me a matter of perfect indifference whether I am 
even elected or not, I do not intend any party shall use me as a conve 
nience ; if dropped I intend to stand a loof, & let whigs & Democrats 
manage this matter in their own way I understand the editors of the 
National Intelligencers have thrown out feelers in one of their late numbers in regard to the movement in favor of Mr Clay. Depend on it there 
will be great changes in the complexion of political affairs between now 
& the end of the next session of congress ; the whigs as a party between 
ourselves, I look upon as doomed ; the democrats greatly out maneuver 
ing them I am gratified I took the position I did, which was not to 
be the exclusive candidate of any party; & if I am elected at all, it will 
be by a union of a portion of whigs, Democrats & native votes At 
any rate I occupy a position & shall continue to do so I hope, that if not 
elected, I shall neither be mortified or disappointed My love to Ann 
& the children if with you, or when you write or see them, as well as best 
wishes to the boys for their success & prosperity when you write them, 
& wishing you & yours continued health & prosperity I remain truly & 
sincerely your friend
