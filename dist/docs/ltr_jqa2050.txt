</p><p>
DEAR SIR: ..... 
</p><p>
December 23. I this morning paid a visit to Mr. Van der Spiegel, the Councillor Pensionary of Holland, whom I have 
hitherto not been able to see on account of his sickness part 
of the time since I arrived, and having twice been so unfortunate when I went to visit him as to find him so much 
engaged that he could not see me. 
</p><p>
I told him I had some time since presented a memorial to 
their High Mightinesses upon the subject of an American 
vessel captured by a privateer with a Dutch Commission, 
carried into the Island of St. Martin s, and her cargo there 
condemned by the Court of Admiralty. That I knew not 
what had been done with my memorial but took the liberty 
to solicit his attention to it. He appeared not to know any 
thing of my memorial, and said it had probably been referred 
to the Council of the Colonies, that he could not conceive 
how they should take an American vessel at St. Martin s, 
between which and the United States there was a commerce, 
and that it would be necessary to obtain information on the 
subject. I told him that in my memorial I had stated that 
documents to prove the facts were in my possession, to 
which he made no reply. 
</p><p>
He asked me if I had heard anything from America of a 
discontent (mecontentement) among the negroes of Demarara. 
I answered I had not, but mentioned the state of health 
existing both in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> and Baltimore, testified by 
your letter of November 8. He said he had no letters from 
America of later date than September. That the news 
from England by yesterday's post mentioned as a mere 
rumor these movements of Demarara, but he presumed had 
there been any foundation for the report, it would have made 
its way from other quarters. 
</p><p>
I observed that many persons concerned in the navigation and commerce between this country and the United 
States had complained to me that it was subjected to restrictions which were extremely inconvenient, that a regulation prescribing the passage north about to American 
vessels, and requiring bonds of treble the value of goods 
shipped, conditioned that they shall be landed at the place 
for which they are cleared, and an express declaration that 
capture by the French shall not be understood to be an ex 
emption from the penalty, was equivalent at this season 
to a complete prohibition. That I had known lately an 
instance of an American vessel obliged to go home in ballast 
in consequence of these regulations, and had reason to 
suppose others in the same predicament ; that as the interests of the United States were concerned in the freedom of 
the navigation of their citizens, I felt myself obliged to make these observations to him. 
</p><p>
He said that "as to navigation at the present season the 
severity of the weather was such as to occasion for some 
time an obstruction to it almost total. That the regulations I mentioned were common to all nations;" and, said 
he, "our own subjects are also bound by them. They had 
been adopted because experience had shown that vessels 
going through the channel could easily either slip into some 
of the ports of France, or cause themselves to be taken. That 
as experience had proved the necessity of some regulation, 
some of the merchants of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> had proposed that 
of going the northern passage, and the gentlemen surely 
could not complain of the effect of their own measure." I re 
plied that any consent given by particular merchants of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> could not at any rate be a support to the regulation at present, when the season rendered the passage 
north about almost impossible, and was doubtless confined 
to that part of the year when that passage is convenient 
or practicable. He said it was not a consent of the gentle 
men but their own proposal, and if they were not satisfied 
with the effect of their own measure, they might address 
themselves. 
</p><p>
He inquired of me whether I knew if General Eustace 
was yet gone? I answered he was. He said that his con 
duct here was very suspicious. That he wore a French 
uniform, that he saw very suspicious persons here ; that 
as he declared he had left the French service in compliance 
with the requisition of American neutrality, some regard 
had been shown him in that consideration, which he did not 
deserve in any other. I said nothing on this subject. 
</p><p>
I then told him I had instructions relative to a difficulty 
which had been made against the admission of a consul 
from the United States in one of the West India Islands 
belonging to this Republic. He said the Colonies had no 
free commerce. That by their old and original Constitu 
tion no foreign nation whatever could carry on any trade 
with them ; that as there could be no foreign legitimate 
commerce to protect, there could be no room for the exer 
cise of consular functions; as to any contraband that might 
be carried on, a consul had never been admitted to encour 
age that. 
</p><p>
I said that by the treaties of commerce subsisting between 
their High Mightinesses and the United States, the stipula 
tion for the reciprocal admission of consuls was without 
any limitation, and it was understood by the government 
of the United States to extend as well to the ports in America 
as elsewhere. He rejoined that it was only meant the ports 
of the Republic in Europe. That it was an ancient difference 
(demele) that they had had with France, who had always 
insisted upon having consuls in their East India colonies, 
but which she had never obtained. That it had been an 
invariable rule observed with respect to all other nations, 
and was founded on the reason he had mentioned, that as 
they could have there no legal commerce, so there could be 
no occasion for the functions of a Consul. 
</p><p>
Such was the substance of a conversation upon which I 
think it unnecessary to make any observations except to 
mention the reason which induced me to speak of the regulation requiring bonds as above mentioned, and also that upon 
which I said nothing in reply to his observations respecting 
General Eustace. The first was because the regulation, 
though in word it is universal in its application, yet from the 
nature of things its operation is, if not exclusively, at least 
more extensively prejudicial to the American navigation 
than to any other. I was in hopes that a mere statement 
of the circumstances would at least discover his dispositions 
as to an alteration. In this particular I was not disappointed, but as to the quality of the dispositions you will 
form an accurate opinion of them from the whole tenor of his 
conversation, which it is unnecessary for me to anticipate. 
</p><p>
As to his reflections upon General Eustace, and the assertion that they had dealt with him more tenderly than he 
deserved out of deference to the United States, I could not 
assent to what he said conformably to my opinion, and I 
could not dissent without making myself at least a party to 
the cause of that gentleman, which I had always given him 
to understand was not my intention without orders to 
justify me. 
</p><p>
I did not think the treatment he received here gave this 
government any title to acknowledgments on the part of 
the United States. 
</p><p>
One of their citizens, who had served in their armies in 
a respectable station and attained a high rank in those of 
France before the war between the two Republics, and which 
he had quitted to preserve the privileges of his country's 
neutrality, is arrested, has a guard set over his person ; his 
papers are seized, sent away the distance of twenty-five 
miles, undergo an examination, are found to contain nothing 
criminal in them, upon which he is released. The liberty, 
the property of an American citizen, the security of his 
dwelling place, the intimacy of his private correspondence, 
all are violated, without any sort of intimation either of the 
design or of the execution to the Minister of the United 
States here, or to their Vice Consul then residing at the 
place where the arrest takes place. Nothing is found upon 
him even sufficient to support suspicion already roused. 
The only ground of the proceeding pretended is that he 
wore a French uniform, and saw suspected persons. 
</p><p>
I could see nothing in this transaction that merited so 
much as my approbation in the capacity of my country's 
representative. 
</p><p>
On the other hand, I was sensible that the particular 
situation of this government at the moment, surrounded 
by foreign and filled with domestic enemies, afforded some 
excuse for extraordinary measures, that a French uniform 
publicly worn would naturally appear to the jealous confirmation strong; that an intimacy with persons in open 
and avowed aversion to the ruling power (though free and 
reputable citizens, exempt from all legal pursuit,) would 
give some plausibility to the severities of fear, and that 
except in the momentary violence offered to the principles 
and feelings which we hold dear, no material injury had 
eventually been suffered by the individual. That the internal proceedings of one government ought not hastily to 
be arraigned by the servant of another nation, and that no 
interest of urgency required of me at this time to give of 
fence. I therefore thought it most advisable to remain 
totally silent upon the subject, and if I am to say anything 
to them about it, to wait for the instructions of the President and your s, Sir, for my authority. . . .
