<p> Dear <a href="results.php?tla=rte">Ruth</a>,
<p> Thank you for your card and letter, as well as the previous letter. I appreciate being kept up to date. I am really sorry things have deteriorated so much, was hoping that the relief of having returned home and gotten through the whole ordeal of the trip would give you smooth sailing for a while.
<p> I&#8217;ll be interested to know what, if anything, shows up in the x-rays, because I really had the impression that physically she was in fair shape considering her age, and the problems were much more emotional and mental. Dan thinks she has a subconscious death wish, and he may be right. I think she has developed a fear of everything- death, the dark, cancer, coping, etc. I think your are right, she no longer thinks she can manage on her own day to day- whenever she moaned to me about what would she do when she was all alone, I&#8217;d suggest that if she really couldn&#8217;t get along with just a girl for two hours daily she should explore what small homes were available, and approved by the county, and if possible at least get on a waiting list for one. She even said she or Inga or someone knew of a good one, but then she&#8217;d say &#8220;But <a href="results.php?tla=jpe">JP</a> will never let me do that.&#8221; I told her I found that hard to believe, as he wants the best for her, like every one else. I don&#8217;t know how all of this works with the various State and Fed programs, but it might be the solution if it turns out she doesn&#8217;t need full institutional care for medical reasons. Of course you couldn&#8217;t take full time care of her, and I really think even she knows that- the fact is I did leave her alone for ½ hour periods occasionally, and she was only here three weeks, and besides that I do drive, so could go out on errands when <a href="results.php?tla=mge">Meg</a> came home or <a href="results.php?tla=dse">Dan</a> was here, but even so I never got up to fix her cereal at 6 a.m. either- rest assured. I really sympathize if that&#8217;s any comfort!
<p> Sure hope things will smooth out for <a href="results.php?tla=gae">Gail</a>, am very unhappy for her- I have three young friends here each one with rather grave marital problems and my heart really goes out to them, as it does to <a href="results.php?tla=gae">Gail</a>- One feels so helpless, too, because each individual case has to be solved by the individuals involved, and there isn&#8217;t much help or advice even that one can give. 
<p> As long as we are commiserating to each  other, let me tell you I know what you mean when you say money is tight- with 4 mortgages and 2 kids in college and the fact that we live in the highest cost of living area in the country, we have really felt the pinch. We&#8217;ve had three rubber checks from one of our tenants, and are wondering if we can afford a lawyer to evict them, let alone find some one to replace them! In the grocery store every week strangers walk up to me and ask if I can believe the prices- I can&#8217;t!
<p> We probably shouldn&#8217;t be spending our savings on our x-mas trip, but what the heck- we really wanted to be with the boys, family and friends back home for the holidays, and at the rate the fares are increasing we probably couldn&#8217;t do it later! Anyway, we are looking forward to seeing you all, and take care in the meantime-
<p> Fondly
