My Darling Husband.
</p><p>
I am keeping my resolution not to write just as I am apt to keep such resolution in writing every day.
</p><p>
I received a letter from you yesterday written on last [...] a week to-day
</p><p>
Am Glad to think of you as attending church regularly. Have not been to church to-day or did not care to take baby and did not feel very well myself - only tired and not quite strong. Beside my local treatment I have medicine from the Dr. for the debility occasioned by the local [...]. I hope to be quiet strong when you see me at Christmas.

Mary and husband came last night to make us a little visit before my departure.
</p><p>
They left this afternoon. They seem very happy together and Mary's health which was a good deal injured by teaching is nearly recovered.
</p><p>
Baby has no diarrhea to-day.
</p><p>
Her [...] is troubling her a good deal now. The Dr. gave me some medicine that he said would cure it but I have not given it yet because [...] treating her for the diarrhea - she seems well and [...] and is a veritable [...] - she embraces every opportunity of gaining access to her grandmother's sugar [...] to pilfer sugar. Apparently for an "all gone feeling in her stomach" as her grandmother says that her father used to.
</p><p>
It is almost as cold as fall to-day - wonder whether you are suffering from the heat - I had a postal card from Lorrie Alton the other day saying that she wrote me months ago and had received no response. I wonder why it is that I lose so many letters? Baby attempts to say many new words and I think will talk like a black bird by winter.
</p><p>
Lucy is already dreading for me to take her away. Do not feel like writing more now. Shall look for that important letter, heralded by so many telegrams, on Sunday - day after tomorrow. Seriously, I am at a loss to know what to think and have felt really unhappy - I do not like to think that you would be so [...] as to object to my receiving needed medical treatment from a physician under whose care your sister has been for nearly three years. But will try to say nothing and think nothing until I receive an explanation of your extraordinary course.
</p><p>
I think I have never more [...] desired to annihilate the space between us these since the receipt of your telegram on Wed. Thus. and Friday. The bells are ringing for evening service, the late sun is shining bright and the world seems beautiful. I feel an involuntary sympathy with it.
</p><p>
With a true love kiss-

10 P.M. - Everybody but me is in bed and I shall be shortly, but I am so lonesome as to be almost low spirited, or else so low spirited as to be lonesome. It [...] much the sensation in the [...]. Pleasant dreams to you.
