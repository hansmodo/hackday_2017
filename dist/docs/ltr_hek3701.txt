Sir, 
</p><p>
I came to this place to-day, to take your Excellency's ultimate directions when the park should join 
the army, and to take any other orders your Excellency should please to give me ; but I was disappointed by the army and your Excellency having 
moved. I presume the laboratory preparations will 
be in such forwardness by Sunday next, that we 
might then move without retarding any thing material. The artificers must remain longer. 
</p><p>
If your Excellency should think fit to alter the 
time of the arrival of the stores from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I 
pray you to write to the Board of War on the subject. If your Excellency should be engaged in any 
operations, which jou intend to lead to immediate action, I hope I may with confidence expect your summons, even previous to the time mentioned above. I 
beg the favor of a speedy answer; and am 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
