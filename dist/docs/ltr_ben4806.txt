DEAR COUSIN, 
</p><p>
I received your kind Letter with your Sons. They are, I 
assure you, exceeding welcome to me ; and they behave with 
so much Prudence, that no two young Men could possibly 
less need the Advice you would have me give them. Josiah is very happily employ'd in his Musical Pursuits. And as you 
hinted to me, that it would be agreable to you, if I employ'd 
Jonathan in Writing, I requested him to put my Accounts in 
Order, which had been much neglected. He undertook it 
with the utmost chearfulness and Readiness, and executed 
it with the greatest Diligence, making me a compleat new Set 
of Books, fairly written out and settled in a mercantile Manner, which is a great Satisfaction to me, and a very considerable Service. I mention this, that you may not be in the 
least Uneasy from an Apprehension of their Visit being 
burthensome to me ; it being, I assure you, quite the contrary. 
</p><p>
It has been wonderful to me to see a young Man from 
America, in a Place so full of various Amusements as London 
is, as attentive to Business, as diligent in it, and keeping as 
close at home till it was finished, as if it had been for his own 
Profit; and as if he had been at the Publick Diversions so 
often, as to be tired of them. 
</p><p>
I pray God to keep and preserve you and yours, and give 
you again, in due time, a happy Sight of these valuable Sons ; 
</p><p>
being your affectionate Uncle, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
