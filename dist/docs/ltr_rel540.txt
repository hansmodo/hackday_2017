<i>[Biographer's note: The question of feeding his army was ever before him.  To see his men hungry and cold, and his horses ill fed, was a great pain to him.  To Mr. Davis he thus writes on this subject:]</i>

                                     Headquarters, April 12, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1864">1864</a>.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jed" rel="co-worker met">Mr. President</a>:  My anxiety on the subject of provisions for the army
is so great that I cannot refrain from expressing it to Your Excellency.
I cannot see how we can operate with our present supplies.  Any derangement in their arrival or disaster to the railroad would render
it impossible for me to keep the army together, and might force a
retreat to North Carolina.  Thee is nothing to be had in this section
for men or animals.  We have rations for the troops to-day and
to-morrow.  I hope a new supply arrived last night, but I have not yet
had a report.  Every exertion should be made to supply the depots at
Richmond and at other points.  All pleasure travel should cease, and
everything be devoted to necessary wants.
</p><p>
      I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,
</p>
                                     <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="me">R. E. Lee.</a>, General.
