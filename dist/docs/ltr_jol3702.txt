Dear General, 
</p><p>
I have written a letter of this date to Congress, 
inclosing one to me from Mr, Moses Young, my 
father's secretary, by which it appears that our Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Versailles had 
not, so late as the 28th of September, received official notice of the resolve of Congress for exchanging 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>. 
</p><p>
I likewise inclosed a letter from General Cornwallis, in which he assures me that all his influence will 
he exerted to effect an exchange between him and 
my father, provided I transmit to him an official paper, authorizing it on the part of Congress. I claim 
your Excellency's promise to interest yourself in a 
business, in which I feel so many powerful public 
and private motives. Your Excellency's friendship 
becomes the more necessary, as I am informed that 
the exchange of Cornwallis has been represented in 
Congress as impolitic, at the present juncture, on account of his talents and influence. TJie former can 
excite no apprehension in my mind, while the American army continues under its present auspices. With 
regard to the latter, which some allege would extend 
to securing a reenforcement and a continuance of 
the war, it appears to me that the credit of no 
one individual would tempt the British Ministry, at 
the present period, to carry their views beyond a 
vigorous effort for the recovery of Georgia and South 
Carolina. This appears to me to be the best plan 
they can propose to themselves, and in the execution 
of it they must employ all their means, let who will command their army. Their most sanguine hopes 
cannot lead them beyond a truce or a treaty upon 
the footing of uti possidetis, they retaining the two 
States above mentioned. As this object will require 
all the military exertions they can possibly make, 
and the aid of every political intrigue, I do not think one General Officer would bring out a larger reenforcement than another. 
</p><p>
These being my sentiments, I apply with confidence 
to your Excellency, and beg leave to solicit, in the 
most earnest terms, your friendly attention to my 
father's circumstances. The continuance of a loathsome imprisonment, in which he is excluded from the 
converse or correspondence of his friends, and labors 
under every illiberal restriction that his mean-spirited, 
tyrannical persecutors can invent, may, at his advanced age, prove fatal. Considering the perseverance 
of the British Ministry in their absurd pretensions, it 
is probable that an exchange would be more readily 
effected under your immediate authority than by the 
intervention of Congress ; and perhaps there are other 
officers, besides Cornwallis, whom the British would be 
glad to receive in exchange for my father. 
</p><p>
I entreat your Excellency's pardon for troubling 
you with this tedious epistle; but my distress for a 
parent, whom I love almost to adoration, and your 
Excellency's goodness, will form an excuse for me. 
I beg your Excellency will accept the sincere and 
repeated assurances of veneration and attachment with 
which I am invariably, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, '
