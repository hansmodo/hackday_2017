DEAR SIR : It seems that some misapprehension exists on the subject of the bill held by Mr. Luckett. I could 
not with delicacy propose to you to take up my bill ; but I repeat that it would gratify me that it could be done. 
My present inability is too manifest. Yours, perhaps, not very different. If, however, you choose to request <a href="/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin">Alston</a> 
to assume this bill as part of his engagement to you, the arrangement would give me real pleasure, and I have no 
doubt may be made satisfactory to him. 
</p><p>
I felicitate you on the events of yesterday, and am always faithfully yours. 
</p><p>
