SENATE CHAMBER, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, May 19, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1862">1862</a>.

Dear Brother: Your official report was so complete 
and satisfactory that it has settled forever all the absurd 
stories about the battle of the 6th and 7th. It also 
shows me that with all my care to be right I made 
several mistakes, especially as to the volunteers of the 
6th and 7th.

Deep anxiety is felt here as to your position. I talked 
with the President on Saturday about the general state of 
the war. He evidently fears the accumulation of forces 
under Beauregard and said he had and would again telegraph <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a> not to move forward until he was certain 
to win. If the Mississippi is clear of the enemy and we 
get Richmond, it is thought that will secure the border 
States and we can afford to wait. In the mean time, even 
under terrible financial pressure and drain of active war, 
the country is flourishing. Our bonds are above par, 
trade is active and produce bears a good price. Much of 
this may be induced by the inflation of paper money, but 
gold is abundant, foreign importations active, and foreigners are making investments here heavily. In my 
experience in public affairs I have never known times 
more easy. If the war could only be brought to a close 
upon the basis of the unity and integrity of the Government, we should have a rebound of national prosperity 
that would soon heal all the losses and burdens of the 
war. As to politics now, lines are being drawn, Kadicals and Conservatives are taking sides without regard 
to party reasons. If the rank Secessionists would only 
give up their insane attempt at division they could easily 
secure every reasonable right. They must, however, lay 
aside the insolence and dogmatism with which they have 
domineered over our better men. If they do not abandon 
their cause, events will force a war in the cotton States 
between the whites and blacks. Hunter has already 
invited it, but his inconsiderate proclamation will be set 
aside. However, delay, defeat or a much longer continuance in the barbarity of rebel warfare will prepare the 
public mind in the North for a warfare that will not 
scruple to avail itself of every means of subjection.

In the course of business I have received many kind 
messages for you from your many friends, among others 
from Swords, Van Vleit, Garesche and others. 
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
