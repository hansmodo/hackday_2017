DEAR SIR 
</p><p>
Our progress in the Revisal has been stopped by the waste 
of time produced by the inveterate and prolix opposition of its 
adversaries, and the approach of Christmas. The Bill proportioning crimes and punishments was the one at which we stuck, 
after wading through the most difficult parts of it. A few subsequent bills, however, were excepted from the postponement. 
Among these was the Bill for establishing Religious freedom, 
which has got through the House of Delegates without alteration, though not without warm opposition. Mr. Mercer and 
Mr. Corbin were the principal Combatants against it. 
</p><p>
Mr. Jones is well. 
</p><p>
With sincerity, I am, your affectionate friend.
