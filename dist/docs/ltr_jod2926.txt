MY BEST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
WE have a confused account from the northward of something unlucky at Ticonderoga, but cannot certainly tell what it is. I am much afraid we shall 
lose that post, as we did forts Washington and Lee ; 
and indeed, I believe we shall, if the enemy surround 
it. But it will prove no benefit to him. I begin to 
wish there was not a fort upon the continent. _ Discipline and disposition are our resources. It is our poicy to draw the enemy into the country, where we 
can avail ourselves of hills, woods, rivers, defiles, &c., 
until our soldiers are more inured to war. Howe and 
Burgoyne will not be able to meet this year, and if they 
were met, it would only be better for us, for we should 
draw all our forces to a point too. If they were met, 
they could not cut off the communication between the 
northern and southern States. But if the communication was cut off for a time, it would be no misfortune, for New England would defend itself, and the 
southern States would defend themselves. 
Colonel Miles is come out of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> on his parole. 
His account is, as I am informed, that Mr. Howe's 
projects are all deranged. His army has gone round 
the circle, and is now encamped in the very spot 
where he was a year ago. The spirits of the To r! es 
are sunk to a great degree, and those of the army too. 
The Tories have been elated with prospects of com 
ing to this city and triumphing, but are miserably disappointed. The Hessians are disgusted, and their general de Heister gone home in a miff.
