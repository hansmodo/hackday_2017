I was unable to reply to my dear sister's letter of 
May 19th when I received it, being visited by St. 
Anthony, who scourged me most cruelly. I am sure 
I wished well to the Spanish patriots, in their late 
struggle for liberty, and I bore no ill-will to those 
whose tutelar saint, thus unprovoked, beset me. I wish 
he had been preaching to the fishes, who, according 
to tradition, have been his hearers ; for so ill did he 
use me, that I came very near losing my senses. I 
think he must be a very bigoted saint, a favorer of 
the Inquisition, and a tyrant. If such are the penances of saints, I hope to hold no further intercourse 
with them. For four days and nights my face was 
so swelled and inflamed, that I was almost blind. It 
seemed as though my blood boiled. Until the third 
day, when I sent for the doctor, I knew not what 
the matter was. It confined me for ten days. My 
face is yet red ; but I rode out to-day, and feel 
much better. I think a little journey would be of 
service to me ; but I find, as years and infirmities 
increase, my courage and enterprise diminish. Ossian says, " Age is dark and unlovely." When I 
look in my glass, I do not much wonder at the story 
related of a very celebrated painter, Zeuxis, who, it 
is said, died of laughing at a comical picture he had 
made of an old woman. If our glass flatters us in 
youth, it tells us truths in age. The cold hand of 
death has frozen up some of the streams of our early 
friendships ; the congelation is gaining upon our 
vital powers, and marking us for the tomb. " May 
we so number our days as to apply our hearts unto 
wisdom."

When my family was young around me, I used to 
find more leisure, and think I could leave it with less 
anxiety than I can now. There is not any occasion 
for detailing the whys and the wherefores. It is 
said, if riches increase, those increase that eat them ; 
but what shall we say, when the eaters increase 
without the wealth ? You know, my dear sister, if 
there be bread enough, and to spare, unless a prudent attention manage that sufficiency, the fruits of 
diligence will be scattered by the hand of dissipation. No man ever prospered in the world without 
the consent and cooperation of his wife. It behoves 
us, who are parents or grandparents, to give our 
daughters and granddaughters, when their education 
devolves upon us, such an education as shall qualify 
them for the useful and domestic duties of life, that 
they should learn the proper use and improvement 
of time, since " time was given for use, not waste.'" 
The finer accomplishments, such as music, dancing, 
and painting, serve to set off and embellish the picture ; but the groundwork must be formed of more 
durable colors. 
</p><p>
I consider it as an indispensable requisite, that 
every American wife should herself know how to 
order and regulate her family ; how to govern her 
domestics, and train up her children. For this purpose, the all- wise Creator made woman an help-meet 
for man, and she who fails in these duties does not 
answer the end of her creation. 
</p><p>
" Life's cares are comforts ; such by Heaven designed ; 
They that have none must make them, or be wretched. 
Cares are employments , and, without employ, 
The soul is on a rack, the rack of rest." 
</p><p>
I have frequently said to my friends, when they 
have thought me overburdened with care, I would 
rather have too much than too little. Life stagnates 
without action. I could never bear merely to vegetate ; 
</p><p>
" Waters stagnate when they cease to flow." 
Has your son sent you or his sister the " Letters 
from the Mountains ?" I think them the finest selection of letters which I have ever read. You may 
with safety recommend them to all your young female 
friends. I cannot find in them any principle, either 
of morals, manners, or religion, to which I cannot 
most heartily subscribe. Read them, and give me 
your opinion of them. Adieu.

Your sister,

A. A.
