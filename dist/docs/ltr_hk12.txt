Stanford University <br> Oct. 17, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1918">1918</a> <br><br> Horace King - <br> Dear friend it has been so long since I received your letter that I am ashamed 
to write, but since I am in the service now I have made new resolutions. Mr. Donaldson 
gave me the last letter he got from you and certainly enjoyed reading it. You 
should certainly be surprised to see Encina Hall converted into a government barracks 
with nearly a thousand U.S. soldiers streaming out at 6:00 am for reveille. Clifford 
Cook and Clifton Slonaker are both here. Our new mess Hall has not been completed 
so we are being fed in field kitchens in back of Encina but the grub is sure good. 
We have our $30.00 a month, board and room, and tuition paid this year so it looks 
like a pretty soft snap, until one begins to feel the pressure of military discipline. 
We are marched to and from our rooms to our classes, from 7pm - 10 o’clock pm, 
we are confined in our rooms to study. This will certainly go hard with most of 
us who don’t know what it is to study. They expect us to work hard because we 
are supposed to be officers, but I don’t think the war will last long enough if 
you fellows keep on going like you have been. There are lots of pretty new girls 
here this year, but I can’t seem to find time to queen any of them on our new 
schedule. How are those notorious little French women whom we have heard so much 
about; I envy the times you are having with them on off hours; but you sure deserve 
it. Last Saturday night I went to a dance in Mt. View and it was the first dance 
I had been to with a uniform on, and believe me you can get by about 90% better 
with the little future war brides. Will have to close now as tattoo blows in 20 
minutes. <br> Yours Truly <br> Pvt Henry M. Tompkins <br>
