</p><p>
DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I have to acknowledge the receipt of two letters from 
you, of the 9th and of the 19th of last month, the former 
of which I received, about three weeks ago, while I was at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, attending upon the session of our Supreme Court, 
and the latter came to hand but two days since. I hope I 
shall ever feel suitably grateful for the tender solicitude 
which you express with respect to my future prospects, 
and I trust I shall always be sufficiently sensible of the 
weight and importance of your advice and directions to 
regulate my conduct. The principal subject of both your 
letters has been long a matter of contemplation to my own 
mind. I have been for some months expecting the judicial 
appointments, upon the presumption that some vacancies 
might be made, which would open a way for making a more advantageous settlement in some part of the Commonwealth 
than there could be while those gentlemen, who were best 
qualified for seats upon the bench, were still at the Bar. 
But the appointments are now made, and have not produced the smallest alteration in the prospects of a young 
candidate for practice. Mr. Paine, the late Attorney General, never did any other business than that of the 
Commonwealth, though Mr. Sullivan, to the same office, 
unites the greatest quantity of civil business of any gentle 
man at the Bar. Mr. Cushing was not even a practitioner, 
so that notwithstanding the disposal of those three important offices, the state of practice remains almost wholly 
as it was before. 
</p><p>
It has become necessary, however, for me to determine speedily upon the spot of my future residence. And in 
reflecting upon the subject, my mind has chiefly hesitated between this town, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> and Braintrce. It was at one 
period expected that Mr. Bradbury, who lives at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=newburyport" rel="city">Newburyport</a>, would supply the place upon the bench which 
was vacated by the removal of Judge Sewall. Had this 
circumstance taken place, I should have been strongly inclined to make an experiment in this place, where a residence of three years has already made me better known 
than I should be in any other situation, and where an agree 
able circle of acquaintance would render the station peculiarly pleasing, so far as respects the intercourse of society. 
</p><p>
But with the small proportion of business which is done 
in the county of Essex, it must be a folly to expect encouragement for a youth in a town, where besides Mr. Parsons and 
Mr. Bradbury there are two other gentlemen of the profession. As I could live at less expense at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>, than 
in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, and perhaps should have less avocations from 
my studies, I should without hesitation go there, and reside 
at least for two or three years ; but my cousin, Mr. Cranch, 
will be there, and by opening offices in the same town we 
could only divide the small pittance which either of us 
singly might obtain. I could not in that case board in his 
father's family. There is not another family in the town 
(at least in "that part of the town) where I could board 
with any convenience, and to live alone in one of your 
houses, besides the unpleasant circumstances of a life so 
solitary, would I think be quite as expensive as to live in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, especially when it is considered that it would be 
necessary for me to be as much as one-third part of my 
time in that town to attend upon the sessions of the several 
judicial courts. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> therefore remains alone, upon 
which I am by a kind of necessity constrained to fix my 
choice. I cannot say I am pleased with the manners of 
the town, and I trust the opportunities and temptations 
to dissipation, which I shall probably find there, have no 
influence upon my determination, unless to increase the 
reluctance with which I make it. I have consulted with 
Dr. Tufts, with Judge Dana, and with Dr. Welsh upon 
the subject, and they all agree in the opinion that I can do 
no better than to fix upon <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, and as you have in one 
of your last letters expressed your approbation of the 
measure, there remains little doubt in my mind, but that I shall put it into execution. The prospect, it is true, is 
not encouraging; but if a resolute determination to make 
my own way, in conjunction with the small talents which 
have been allotted to me, are sufficient to procure me even 
a moderate degree of success, I hope I shall not be much 
longer a burden to the kindest and most generous of parents. 
</p><p>
With respect to the article of board, it would not I imagine 
be easy to find a family who would resign the front room 
and chamber, as there is but one of each in the house, and 
unless some advantage could be derived from the circumstance of living and keeping an office in the same house, I 
think it would be preferable to do otherwise. If a tenant 
can be found, who will upon consideration of a suitable 
abatement of the rent resign the front room in your house, 
Dr. Tufts has promised to secure it to me for an office. 
And Dr. Welsh has made me an offer to board me, and 
let me have a chamber in a house to which he expects to 
remove, before I shall have occasion to go into <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. I 
did not agree with him upon any settled terms, but I presume he will not demand more than three dollars by the 
week. In the town I have always given two and one half. 
</p><p>
Should my present expectations and intentions be con 
firmed I shall probably get settled in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> some time in 
August, and I shall request your permission to remove 
thither your law library, which is now at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>. The 
advantage of having such a collection of books around me, 
will give me perhaps some opportunities, which few of the 
young gentlemen of the profession have possessed, and they 
will at least enable me to employ to some purpose a great 
portion of time which must otherwise lay heavy upon my 
hands. 
</p><p>
I believe I have said quite enough upon a subject of so 
little consequence as myself. I wish my information in the 
political line were such as would enable me to supply you 
with any interesting communications. The public mind 
here seems chiefly agitated by the late discussions relative 
to discrimination and to the assumption of the debts. The 
decision upon the former of these subjects, meets with the 
approbation of almost all the persons with whom I have 
had opportunities of conversing. But I am apprehensive 
that unless the consent of the States in their respective 
legislatures is requested by Congress to the assumption, 
that measure will be extremely unpopular, even in this 
Commonwealth, burthened as it is with one of the heaviest 
debts in the union. And if that consent should be required, I am informed by those who are more connected 
with political affairs, that even our General Court will 
never grant it, though in their late session they have not 
made provision for the payment of a quarter part of the 
interest upon their debt. New Hampshire, whose debt is 
comparatively trifling will be still more opposed to this 
measure. This opposition is not confined to the party 
who were termed anti-federalists. Some of the most 
strenuous advocates for the Constitution are alarmed at 
the prospects of a consolidation of the States and of the 
dissolution of the particular governments. And they dread 
to see an article so weighty and important as the State debts 
taken from one scale and added to the other. 
</p><p>
The internal politics of the State are in a state of tranquility, very unusual at this season. The opposers of the 
Governor, discouraged I presume by the ill success which they have always experienced, seem determined to leave 
him in quiet possession. He has been confined as usual all winter with the gout, and his judicial appointments 
have been the only public circumstances which have for 
some time past been the subject of animadversion. The 
appointment of Mr. Paine was rather popular. That of 
Mr. Gushing was far otherwise. The friends of the Governor only insist upon the disinterested magnanimity of 
nominating a man who it is said has been invariably opposed 
to his measures, while his enemies are so far from acknowledging his disinterestedness, that they censure him very 
highly for nominating to one of the most important offices 
in the State, a man totally unqualified to sustain it, merely 
to be freed from his troublesome opposition as a councillor. 
The late Chief Justice, revered as his character universally 
is, does not altogether escape censure for recommending so 
earnestly his cousin to an employment, to which he is 
almost universally said to be very inadequate. Your dutiful son.
