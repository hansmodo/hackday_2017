DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
Since I wrote the enclosed, I have received a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>. His orders are, not to suffer the flag schooner to be taken or 
detained. You will follow my orders respecting that business. I have 
answered Capt. Howell's letter by this opportunity. In respect to your 
corps, the General and Governor approves of the plan of dismounting 
them, to act in <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> as infantry; but will not impress any more 
horses for the service of either corps, as their time will so soon expire, 
and it seems not their intention of keeping them up longer. I shall 
write you fuller in my next. 
</p><p>
I am, with esteem, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=frm" rel="me">FRANCIS MARION</a>.
