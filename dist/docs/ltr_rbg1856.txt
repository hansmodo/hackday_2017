TO BENJAMIN GRATZ 
</p><p>
Thank you my beloved Brother for the assurance that you were safely in the vicinity of your home, where I hope you  found all the Dear ones well- and made happy by your return- I think over the precious hours we spent together, and 
pray we may meet again under happier times when peace & good will will reign throughout the land- give my best love to 
Dear Ann, and our sweet girls & also to my nephews- Becky and her little girl brought Gratz to us on Friday- they are all 
well- the Etting invalids are better- poor Edward seems to be fading away. 
</p><p>
Horace sends you his love. God Bless you My darling Brother
