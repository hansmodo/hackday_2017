</p><p>
After the one-sided fight yesterday, of which I have 
spoken, we expected to remain in quiet until the next 
day, but our battalion and the First Brigade were 
ordered to advance at three o clock and after marching 
a mile and a half from the town were halted near a 
hacienda, our little battalion being far out in a naked 
corn field, where from the nature of the ground our 
wagons were unable to reach us. It was near night 
when we got our position the sky threatened a 
storm and we had been without food nearly all the 
day. We received orders that no fires would be allowed, and that the men must remain by their arms 
as we were to march sometime between eight and 
ten in the evening. Before ten it rained violently 
with a driving wind, completely drenching us all, and 
the time for marching was changed to three in the 
morning. 
</p><p>
The poor men were without greatcoats or blankets 
and were excessively uncomfortable. I had brought 
my cloak on my horse, and with my saddle for a pillow, 
I lay down on the ground and despite the pelting 
storm slept soundly until I was waked by an aide-de camp giving orders that the march should be deferred 
till daylight. The storm was entirely past and I obtained permission to build a fire, by which the men 
dried their dripping clothes and put their arms in 
order. We started at dawn and soon came into a 
little village from which the spires and domes of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=puebla" rel="city">PUEBLA</a> were visible. Here we saw two beautiful 
carriages of English make which late in the night 
brought a deputation from the city to confer with 
General Worth. We soon proceeded, throwing out 
flankers and using every precaution against surprise. 
About two miles from the city we halted at a heavy 
stone bridge over a small stream where the entire 
division with Quitman s Brigade was closed up, our 
baggage placed in rear of all but a guard, when with 
our colors displayed and our bands playing national 
airs we marched into the city over a fine macadamized 
road thronged with immense numbers of the teeming 
population. 
</p><p>
This place has no suburbs, does not thin off to the 
country as our cities do, but from the cultivated fields 
you come at once among the compactly built dwellings. 
The streets are broad, and were swarming with the 
multitude as far as the eye could reach, the cross 
streets too were filled in every direction, indeed, I am 
sure I never before saw half so many people together. 
Our little army of four thousand was completely lost 
in the crowds that pressed around us, examining us 
pretty much as they would the animals in a menagerie. 
As we marched in front of the palace we were saluted 
by the municipal troops, and on reaching the large 
central plaza we were halted, stacked our arms, and 
rested about two hours while quarters were assigned 
to the different corps. I have seen as yet but little 
of the place, but quite enough to satisfy me that there 
is nothing to compare with it in the United States. A 
great many priests were moving about among the 
throng or sitting on the balconies with the ladies. 
They all wore black robes and on their heads felt hats 
resembling in shape a flattened piece of stove pipe 
with a hole in the side for the head. As they passed 
all the people took off their hats and bowed low. I 
believe we are all now in our quarters, sentinels 
posted and patrols established for the night. 
</p><p>
The papers here state that Santa Anna lost ninety 
men in the skirmish yesterday. I have not half told 
the story of the fight, but I must cut off my long 
yarn. . . . 
</p><p>
May 16. . . . Yesterday after making my toilet I 
dined at the Commercio, an eating-house near the 
palace kept by a little Frenchman. This is Sunday. 
I went to Mass at the Cathedral. This vast building, 
standing on one side of the plaza opposite the palace, 
far surpasses any church I have ever seen, and is said 
to be the richest and most beautiful one in the entire 
New World. At some future day I may say more of 
this building, but at present have only time to remark 
that the interior is rich beyond description with silver 
and gold ornaments, polished marble, and a very 
great number of admirable old paintings of great 
value. 
</p><p>
There have been several cases of stabbing today 
and one soldier killed. It is dangerous to go about 
alone or unarmed, indeed the orders are that no one 
shall leave his quarters without arms. It is thought 
that the guerillas and rabble are in league together, 
and in consequence of some information to this effect 
the guards have been doubled this evening since tattoo 
and all are cautioned to be ready for service. 
</p><p>
May 17. Late last night after scratching the above 
I went to bed but was soon aroused by the galloping 
of a horse which halted at the entrance to my quarters, 
and Worth's adjutant-general called to me that he 
desired to see Colonel Smith. There was a fresh alarm 
arising from anonymous letters to the general, and 
we were, therefore, required to be exceedingly vigilant. 
He had hardly left when a Mexican came groaning to 
our door, severely stabbed and cut in the head. I 
have learned enough Mexican to understand from his 
statements that the native thieves (ladrones) were 
robbing his house and maltreating his family, but as 
we make it a rule to let these people settle their own 
difficulties we directed him to go at once to the Alcalde. 
The first night of our arrival a young woman was 
stabbed to death immediately in front of our quarters, 
and lay on the pavement until ten o clock the next 
day. We were fortunately able to prove that it was 
the act of a Mexican. These disturbances made us 
feel quite uneasy we feared that before morning 
there would be a general alarm, but nothing happened, 
all was quiet this morning and so continued through 
the day. I have been confined to my quarters most 
of the time in consequence of the absence of Colonel 
Smith the order requiring that one of the field 
officers of each battalion be always present with it. 
General Worth and staff with all the senior officers 
called in great state upon the Bishop, who is represented as a venerable, liberal, and highly accomplished 
old gentleman. The call was ceremoniously returned 
in a few hours. The courtesy which we are showing 
to these officials is certainly good policy, for if we can 
only get the clergy on our side peace must soon ensue. 
Their influence, which is unbounded, can alone control the lower orders in this densely populated district. 
I have been in many of the stores this afternoon and 
made some few purchases. Ordinary articles of merchandise are very reasonable though imported goods 
are dear. A bottle of French brandy which could be 
had in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">New York</a> for seventy-five cents costs two 
dollars here, and sperm candles are ten shillings per 
pound. Anything can be obtained here for money. 
The fruit market is admirable. . . . Everything is 
quiet this evening no new cases of stabbing I 
think all excitement is dying away.

Our communications with the coast are so very 
uncertain that I am likely to get a large packet for 
you before I have an opportunity to send it off. 
</p><p>
May 18 The inhabitants are fast losing 
</p><p>
their false impressions and becoming reconciled to us. 
The more I see of this city the more I admire it. It 
is kept exceedingly clean the streets which are all 
admirably paved with square blocks of granite look 
as if they were not only swept, but scoured. The side 
walks are about five feet in breadth. The inhabitants 
early in the morning sweep in front of their houses, 
bringing from the interior the accumulated dirt of the 
previous twenty-four hours, placing it in heaps in the 
middle of the street. By sunrise the police carts are 
passing and all the filth is carried entirely out of the 
city. Another source of purification is the regular 
rains, which commence every day about half-past 
four and continue about three hours. The rest of the 
day is clear and the temperature delightful. This is 
invariable for several months in the year. The city 
is built on a rich and extensive plain not far from the 
base of the snow-crowned mountains, Orizaba, Popo 
catepetl, and Volcano de <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=puebla" rel="city">PUEBLA</a>, of which I have 
so often spoken and of which the eye never wearies. 
The horizon in every other direction is bounded by 
mountains of lesser magnitude. The streets are laid 
out at right angles. The houses which are admirably 
constructed in the old Spanish style are generally two 
stories in height, though often three. On some of the 
streets and around the main plaza the upper story 
projects over the sidewalk and is supported by arches 
resting on a heavy colonnade, often of the purest 
Doric order. The roofs are all flat, of stone or brick, 
covered with excellent cement. There are no eave 
gutters, but every few feet a long spout of tin or stone 
often richly carved projects from the foot of the 
battlement throwing the water beyond the sidewalk. 
In the interior of each dwelling is a square court, 
generally with a fine fountain playing in the centre of 
a large, stone reservoir, around which are fruit and 
ornamental trees and great numbers of pots contain 
ing the beautiful and ever-blooming plants of this 
glorious clime where there is one eternal spring. 
Here once might have been paradise, and still might 
be, were not man so vile. There are a great number 
of fine churches in the city, I should think at least 
twenty, and although the interiors of all which I have 
entered are richly ornamented with statuary, paintings 
and gilding they sink into insignificance compared 
with the Cathedral. Besides the " stove-pipe priests," 
whom I saw on the day of our arrival, many others 
are constantly passing to and fro in the streets. 
Dominicans in their white robes, Franciscans in their 
gray ones, with their deep hoods and rope girdles. I 
do not know of any nuns here. . . . 
</p><p>
May ig. All sorts of rumors have been flying about 
among us. One report is, and it seems to be the most 
authentic, that Santa Anna has abandoned San 
Miguel where he was fortifying with the intention 
of giving us battle, and has moved towards Mexico. 
It is said a portion of his troops one thousand 
cavalry have left him. On the fifteenth instant the 
presidential election took place throughout the country. It was over here before we entered the city. 
Santa Anna, of course, is a prominent candidate, 
though he has lost much of his popularity, and it is 
thought will be defeated. It is even reported here 
this afternoon that Herrera, the peace candidate, is 
elected. I doubt it for it could not be known yet, 
if it were so, as each state or department, as with us, 
makes up its returns, which I believe are counted at 
the Capital. 
</p><p>
General Twiggs with his command is expected in 
two or three days. 
</p><p>
May 20. Very little news today. I regret that I 
am so much confined to the quarters that I cannot 
visit the forts about the town, from one of which the 
famous pyramid of Cholula, though several miles 
distant, is visible. ... A large quantity of govern 
ment tobacco was seized today, worth at least one 
hundred thousand dollars. Tobacco here is a govern 
ment monopoly its growth confined to certain districts, its universal use by both sexes makes it a 
source of great revenue. 
</p><p>
May 21. ... I have been to Fort Loretto today, 
which is built upon a hill some two hundred feet 
above the plain, and is about fifteen hundred yards 
to the east of the city, which it commands, and is itself 
commanded by the Church of Guadalupe. 
</p><p>
From it there is an exquisite view of the plain, city, 
and surrounding country. . . . The people here 
think Herrera is elected. I still doubt it. ... 
</p><p>
Sunday, May 23. I attended the service in the 
Cathedral this morning. Worth and his staff were 
there among the crowded audience, who were kneeling 
on the marble floor during the gorgeous ceremonies, 
where everything is calculated to strike the senses not 
to persuade the reason. There are but few seats in 
any of the churches in this country, most of the worshipers kneeling in the body of the building, con 
stantly repeating their prayers, crossing themselves, 
and beating their breasts during the chanting, apparently as humble and contrite as beings can be. 
</p><p>
May 25. Nothing of interest has occurred today or 
yesterday. We hear thousands of reports about the 
Mexican forces to which I pay little attention. It 
appears certain, however, that they are assembling 
a large force twenty thousand it is said in and 
about the Capital, though they are neither well 
armed nor disciplined. If we advance they will 
probably make a stand a few leagues this side of the 
City of Mexico. I still, however, strongly hope that 
negotiations for peace will be begun before we leave 
this place though the prospect is darker than it 
was a few days since. The other division of the army 
under Twiggs left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a> Saturday and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> 
on Sunday, and are expected to arrive here on Friday. 
We shall then be over eight thousand strong. What 
an immense army to invade a populous country and 
conquer a nation! We may, in fact, be considered a 
forlorn hope ! always contending against desperate 
odds. 
</p><p>
If fifty thousand men had landed at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a>, I 
don t believe there would have been a battle and we 
should now be in the City of Mexico or have already 
made peace. 
</p><p>
May 26. I am now so much confined to my quarters, not having left them in three days, that I see little 
of what is going on. All is quiet in the city though 
we are kept constantly on the alert by frequent reports 
of projected risings among the people, and a Mexican 
was detected yesterday night posting inflammatory 
handbills. Report says today that General Bravo 
at the head of sixteen thousand men is advancing 
from Mexico. That there is some movement in that 
quarter appears certain, probably they are fortifying 
some strong point on the road which they intend 
to hold. Our communications are now so uncer 
tain with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a> that I think it exceedingly 
doubtful if this ever reaches you. I trust, however, 
you will receive it and if you do not hear again for 
months will attribute it to the proper cause, and console yourself with the certainty that a heavy package 
is accumulating. ... It will be well hereafter not 
to draw any pay until you hear that I am in the land 
of the living at the close of the month for which you 
draw. I have just been privately told that a courier 
leaves in the morning and I expect to get this into his 
budget. I feel in closing these sheets that I am taking 
a long leave of you and my heart is heavy. . . .
