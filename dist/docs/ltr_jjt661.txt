My dear Sister,
</p><p>
Your letter & that of Grace reached me this morning and for a while I thought that I might be able to visit you previous to going North, but after more maturely considering my case, & all the circumstances, I am disposed to think that I had better go North first. My disease is not understood by my physicians here and I have nearly if not entirely lost my hearing in the right ear & my left ear is diseased, and my nose is internally affected. The first thing it appears to me should be to seek relief if it is to be had.
</p><p>
Write to me to N.Y. City, and tell Tom and Grace that they must write to me this summer also, as soon as I let you all know where my letters will reach me after leaving N.Y. City. Tell Grace that I am much obliged to her for her letter, and that she may expect me to answer it before a great while. As to Thomas' examination, I think Mr. Thomas can judge better of his qualifications than myself, though I wish that I could be with you all before his teacher leaves. I hope to be with you in the latter part of August.

I forwarded a check to Wirt for one hundred & five dollars on N.J. I had to pay a premium of one per cent for it and urged him to refund the money on the first of Sept. according to promise. If I had known that he had found his horse, I don't know that I should have sent him so much. I have need of all the money that I can command. When you write to him, tell him that he had better sell me one of his horses.
</p><p>
Anna joins me in much love to you & the children. Remember me to Mr. Thomas & his lady & to all enquiring friends.
</p><p>
Your affec. brother,<br/>
