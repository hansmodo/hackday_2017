DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
... I am glad you are returned again to a Seat in the 
Assembly, where your Abilities are so useful and necessary 
in the Service of your Country. We must not in the Course 
of Publick Life expect immediate Approbation and immediate 
grateful Acknowledgment of our Services. But let us persevere thro' Abuse and even Injury. The internal Satisfaction 
of a good Conscience is always present, and Time will do us Justice in the Minds of the People, even of those at present 
the most prejudiced against us. 
</p><p>
I have given Dr. Denormandie a Recommendation to a 
Friend in Geneva, for which Place he set out this Morning ; 
and I shall be glad of any Opportunity of serving him when 
he returns to London. I see by the Pens Gazette, of Oct. 21, 
that you are continued Speaker, and myself Agent; but I 
have no Line from you or the Committee relative to Instructions. Perhaps I shall hear from you by Falconer. I find 
myself upon very good Terms with our new Minister, Lord 
Dartmouth, who we have reason to think means well to the 
Colonies. I believe all are now sensible, that nothing is to 
be got by contesting with or oppressing us.

Two Circumstances have diverted me lately. One was, 
that being at the court of Exchequer on some Business of 
my own, I met there with one of the Commissioners of the 
Stamp Office, who told me he attended with a Memorial 
from that Board, to be allowed in their Accounts the Difference between their Expence in endeavouring to establish 
those Offices in America, and the Amount of what they received, which from Canada and the W. India Islands was but 
about <a href='/results.php?year=1500'>1500</a>^, while the Expence, if I remember right was 
above 2,000 , being for Stamps and Stamping, with Paper 
and Parchment return'd upon their Hands, Freight, &c. 
The other is the present Difficulties of the India Company, 
and of Government on their Ace'. The Comp a have accepted 
Bills, which they find themselves unable to pay, tho' they have 
the Value of Two Millions in Tea and other India Goods in 
their Stores, perishing under a Want of Demand; their 
Credit thus suffering, and their Stock falling 120 p ct . The 
Bank will not advance for them, and no Remedy is thought 
of but lowering their Dividend from 12^ to 6| per Cent, 
whereby Government will lose the 400,000 ; per ann, it 
having been stipulated that it should no longer be paid, if 
the Dividend fell to that Mark. And, altho' it is known, 
that the American Market is lost by continuing the Duty 
on Tea, and that we are supply'd by the Dutch, who doubtless take the Opportunity of Smuggling other India Goods 
among us with the Tea, so that for the 5 Years past we might 
probably have otherwise taken off the greatest Part of what 
the Cornp' have on hand, and so have prevented their present 
Embarrasment, yet the Honour of Government is suppos'd 
to forbid the Repeal of the American Tea Duty; while the 
Amount of all the Duties goes on decreasing, so that the 
Ballance of this Year does not (as I have it from good Authority) exceed 80 , after paying the Collection ; not reckoning the immense Expence of Guarda-Costas, &c. Can an 
American forbear smiling at these Blunders? Tho', in a 
national Light, they are truly deplorable. 
</p><p>
With the sincerest Esteem and inviolable Attachment, 
I am, my dear Friend, ever most affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
