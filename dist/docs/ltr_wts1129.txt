Dear Brother : Your letter was received yesterday. I 
know that others than yourself think I take a gloomy 
view of affairs without cause. I hope to God 'tis so. 
'All I know is the fact that all over Kentucky the people 
are allied by birth, interest, and preference to the Southj 
Their trade points that way and in spite of all efforts 
letters pass to and fro daily. Applications come by hundreds asking protection which cannot be granted, and all 
know the fact that we have not the power to prevent it. 
Again the men who have come here by regiments are 
exposed to not only the chances of war but of interruption to the railroad which I have guarded thus far successfully, but a child or man with a crowbar may destroy 
it. Now that Buell is in command I might divest myself 
of all care on this score. We have been out to camp 
inspecting the troops and he has entered upon his duties 
and I have delayed here simply to give him information. 
I have not been instrumental in bringing troops here, 
and I will give no advice on the subject. . . . 
</p><p>
They have sent here old condemned European [muskets], and have sent no arms for Cavalry, and when I 
bought pistols wherewith to arm some scouts the accounts 
have been disallowed at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> because I had not 
procured authority beforehand. Troops come from Wisconsin and Minnesota without arms and receive such as 
we have here for the first time, and I cannot but look 
upon it as absolutely sacrificing them. I see no hope 
for them in their present raw and undisciplined condition, and some terrible disaster is inevitable. . . . 
</p><p>
[For myself I will blindly obey my orders and report 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Gen. Halleck</a> in Missouri, but till I can see daylight 
ahead I will never allow myself to be in command^ 
</p><p>
Affectionately, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wts" rel="me">W. T. SHERMAN</a>.
