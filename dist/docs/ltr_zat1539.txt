D r Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your acceptable letters of the 29 th ult & first ins were duly rec d . I 
was satisfied from the late hour you fairly got under way for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Point Isabel" rel="city">Point Isabel</a>l 
the day you left here for that place, in addition to the heat of the weather 
that you would be late in getting down, & as a matter of course would 
have an unpleasant and fatiguing trip ; but it appears you all got down 
safe, & a few days rest and quiet I trust will make all right or as it 
should be 
</p><p>
The trip to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Detroit" rel="city">Detroit</a> I apprehend would be too great an undertaking 
for Mrs Taylor in her feeble state of health, or at any rate I am confi 
dent she would think so, I will however in my next letter mention the 
matter to her so as to enable her to make up her mind on the same

I felt satisfied Gen Brady would decidedly disapprove Cap Thompson s resigning at the time he did, & I regretted it on the Genl 8 acct . As 
Worth was a particular favorite with the old Gen I make no doubt he 
was mortified at his course & did not hesitate to condemn it in strong terms I regret on his W own ace his course at the Point which was caused I have no doubt by excitement from the effects of wine ; it 
seems to me under the circumstances in which he was placed, & that by 
his own willfulness, his course and bearing should have been on all occasions marked by great modesty ; and which has been the case since he 
got here ; but the fact is between ourselves, he has been pampered and 
bloated for things he never done, or acts he never performed, but from 
assumption, & getting others to state occurrencies the truth of which may 
be very well called in question, if stronger language could not be properly 
applied, and his flourish among the wounded was in keeping with many 
other of his acts, all for effect ; his situation at the time causing him to 
forget or overlook other important considerations. There are few if any 
officer or officers in service, who require more to make from the private 
soldier to make himself comfortable, or who would put himself to less 
inconvenience for their benefit in sickness or health, wounded or other 
wise than Gen W flies or no flies yet you ought not to have taken 
any notice of the matter, unless he had called your official conduct 
directly in question He has not alluded to the subject directly or indi 
rectly since his return to this place ; at any rate so as to come to my 
knowledge

The report as regards any contemplated movement on the part of 
Gen Smith, is entirely without foundation I contemplate sending the 
four comp s in a few days of the first Infy. to Rinoso fifty miles in advance, 
or higher up the river Transportation is very scarce rendered more so 
by the destruction of so many vessels by the late storm I truly regret 
the inconvenience & sufferings the sick and wounded were subjected to 
by the late storm I will direct the Long to be fitted up for a 
Hospital

I did not get the scrape of a pen by the Alabama from Washington 
or any where else which induces me to believe that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen. Scott</a> is on his 
way here, which I sincerely hope may be the case Mr. Crittends 
course in the Senate was truly gratifying, and more so as I fulfilled his 
high expectations to the letter 
</p><p>
I was delighted to learn all was as well as usual at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Detroit" rel="city">Detroit</a>, give my 
love to them all when you write I rec d letters from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> dated 
the 18th  they had heard of the affairs of the 8th  & 9th , all were well. 
Nothing of interest here. The volunteers are getting quite impatient ; 
they want either to be led against the enemy or to go home. I have no 
time to write more.

Your Friend

Truly & sincerely,
