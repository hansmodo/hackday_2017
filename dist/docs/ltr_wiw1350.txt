DEAR SIR: Your letter of yesterday relates to a meeting of the cabinet in 
the summer of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1818">1818</a>, relative to the Seminole war. I should not feel myself at liberty to disclose the proceeding of any cabinet meeting without life 
concurrence of the President and of all the members who attended it; but 
as your inquiry relates to your own course only, and I can speak of that 
without involving any one else, I see no impropriety in doing so at your 
request. Among other ideas thrown out for consideration, according to the 
usual course of cabinet consultations, I think that, at the first meeting, you 
suggested the propriety of an inquiry into the conduct of the commanding, 
general; but I remember that the course ultimately adopted had your hearty 
concurrence; and I remember it the more distinctly because you mentioned 
it repeatedly to me afterwards, as a striking evidence of the practical wisdom of the President, who suggested it. Thus much I feel myself authorized by the call to say of those deliberations. The circumstances mentioned in the extract you enclose, purporting to be an " extract of a letter from 
W. H. Crawford, Esq. to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jof" rel="colleague met">John Forsyth</a>, Esq., dated April 30, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1830">1830</a>," 
have no place in my recollection. The letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a> to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">President Monroe</a>, therein mentioned, is entirely new to me. According 
to the description of the letter, given of it in the extract, it is one of so singular a character, that, if it had been exhibited at any meeting at which i was 
present, I think that I could not have forgotten it. The occurrence is said 
to have taken place twelve years ago. I kept no notes in writing of any of 
those deliberations, and am speaking merely from memory. But still I 
think, that if such a letter had been produced and read in my presence, I 
should have retained some recollection of it; whereas it strikes me, in the 
description, as a thing perfectly new, and of which I never heard before. 
In the close of the extract, the writer says: "After that letter was produced, 
I should have opposed the infliction of punishment upon the general, who 
had considered the silence of the President as a tacit consent." I have no 
recollection that punishment had been proposed by any one, unless an inquiry into the official conduct of the general can be regarded as punishment. It strikes me, too, that if that letter had been produced, and Mr Crawford had placed his implied charge of opinion on the inference of acquiescence which he supposed the general to be authorized to draw from 
the President s silence, it could- not have escaped observation, and such a 
discussion as would have tended to have fixed the occurrence on my memory, that the general had not asked the President for an acquiescence to be inferred from silence, but for a positive hint of his approbation through 
"some confidential member of Congress, say Johnny Ray." Upon the 
whole, Sir, if these things did really occur in my presence, I can only say 
that they have left not the slightest trace on my memory.

Your obedient servant,
