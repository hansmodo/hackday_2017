<a rel='month origin' value='6'>June</a> <a rel='day origin' value='2'>2d</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. A battle is said to be raging round Richmond. I am at the Prestons . James Chesnut has gone to 
Richmond suddenly on business of the Military Department. It is always his luck to arrive in the nick of time 
and be present at a great battle.

Wade Hampton shot in the foot, and Johnston Pettigrew killed. A telegram says <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>Lee</a> and Davis were both on 
the field: the enemy being repulsed. Telegraph operator said: " Madam, our men are fighting." " Of course they 
are. What else is there for them to do now but fight? " " But, madam, the news is encouraging." Each army is 
burying its dead : that looks like a drawn battle. We haunt the bulletin-board.

Back to McMahan -s. Mem Cohen is ill. Her daughter, Isabel, warns me not to mention the battle raging around 
Richmond. Young Cohen is in it. Mrs. Preston, anxious and unhappy about her sons. John is with General Huger 
at Richmond; Willie in the swamps on the coast with his company. Mem tells me her cousin, Edwin de Leon, is sent 
by <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis</a> on a mission to England.

Rev. Robert Barnwell has returned to the hospital. Oh, that we had given our thousand dollars to the hospital and 
not to the gunboat! " <a href='/results.php?tla=tjj' rel=''>Stonewall Jackson's</a> movements, " 
the Herald says, " do us no harm ; it is bringing out volunteers in great numbers." And a Philadelphia paper abused 
us so fervently I felt all the blood in me rush to my head with rage.
