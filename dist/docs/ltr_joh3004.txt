Your letters of the 25th and 31st of December, 
and 4th of January, have been duly received, and 
laid before Congress. 
</p><p>
By the inclosed resolutions, you will perceive that 
the Congress, in providing for the defence of Canada, 
have directed that two battalions should be raised 
out of the troops now serving there. This they did 
in testimony of their approbation of the services of 
those brave men, apprehending, at the same time, 
that it would be both agreeable to the officers and 
men to have the honor of defending a country, which 
their valor had rescued from slavery. And the congress have a firm confidence, that <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague'>General Montgomery</a>, who has a warm and just sense of their merit 
and services, will cheerfully embrace the present opportunity to continue and promote the officers of that 
corps, and, as far as in his power, to reward with 
office and command, in those battalions, such volunteers and others as have distinguished themselves. 
</p><p>
The Committee, to whom your letters were referred, 
this day brought in a partial report; on which the 
Congress came to certain resolutions, which you will 
see in the inclosed extracts. I am just to acquaint 
you, that it is expected, when the Paymaster draws 
any bills, he will observe to make them payable some 
few days after sight. The Committee have desired 
leave to sit again, which is granted. As soon as 
they have completed their report, and the Congress 
have come to a determination thereon, I shall do my 
self the pleasure of transmitting it to you. The 
money last voted, is now ready ; and the persons 
who have the charge of conveying it will, I expect, 
set out with it to-morrow. 
</p><p>
I .have the pleasure to inform you, that the committee have purchased the saltpetre, and have agreed 
with the owners of mills to manufacture it into powder. One of the mills, it is expected, will make 
near a ton a week, and another near half a ton. I 
hope you will soon receive the powder ordered to he 
purchased at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. There were, as we are in 
formed, eight tons in the same vessel imported for 
that Colony. 
</p><p>
The public papers will inform you, that Lord Dun-more has endeavoured to exercise the same barbarity 
against the defenceless town of Norfolk, as was exercised against Falinouth. By these repeated instances 
of inhumanity, so contrary to the rules of war, and so 
long exploded by all civilized nations, it would seem 
as if the rancorous Ministry, despairing of their measures to conquer and enslave, had determined to glut 
their revenge with destruction and devastation. For 
my part, I shall not be surprised to hear, that in their 
frenzy of rage, and to effect their dark purposes, 
they have proceeded to murder, under forms of law, 
those prisoners whom the tools of their vengeance 
have chanced to take, and whom, with officious zeal, 
they have sent to England. 
</p><p>
As it is now apparent that our enemies mean to 
exert their whole force against us next summer, the 
Congress are taking measures for putting the middle 
and southern Colonies in a posture of defence. We 
shall doubtless suffer much in this great struggle ; 
but I trust no losses or sufferings will induce us to 
desert the defence of our liberty; and that, cost what 
it may, we will persevere, with unremitting vigor, to 
maintain that inestimable jewel which we received 
from our ancestors, and transmit the same, with unsullied lustre, to our posterity. 
</p><p>
January 18. The Committee, to whom your letter 
of the 31st of December was referred, desire to be 
informed whether the companies stationed at Chelsea and Maiden are regimented ; and whether, if 
those at Hingham, Weymouth, and <a href='/results.php?city=braintree' rel='city'>Braintree</a>, were withdrawn, it would be necessary to replace them out of the Continental Army. 
</p><p>
Since writing the above, we have received a letter 
from Messrs. Philip Livingston, Alsop, and Lewis, by 
which we find, to our mortification, that we were 
misinformed with regard to the large quantity of 
powder arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and that there were 
only four hundred and sixty-two quarter casks, which 
were imported for the use of that Colony, and of 
which a great part is distributed among several 
Counties. 
</p><p>
Before this comes to hand, you will doubtless receive an account of the disagreeable news from Quebec, on which I sincerely condole with you. The 
express arrived here last evening. To-day I expect the Congress will take it into consideration. The result of their deliberations you will have in my 
next letter. I am, &c.
