</p><p>
Dear Brother: I have no doubt you have been duly 
concerned about my being summoned to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. 
</p><p>
It was imprudently done by the President without 
going through <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant</a>. But I think I have smoothed it 
over so that Grant does not feel hurt. I cannot place 
myself in a situation even partially antagonistic with 
Grant. We must work together. Mr. Johnson has not 
offered me anything, only has talked over every subject, and because I listen to him patiently, and make 
short and decisive answers, he says he would like to 
have me here. Still he does not oppose my going back 
home. . . . 
</p><p>
On Monday I will start for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a> by the Atlantic 
and G. W. Road, and pass <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mansfield" rel="city">Mansfield</a> Tuesday. Can't 
you meet me and ride some miles? I have been away 
from home so much, and must go right along to Fort 
Laramie, that I cannot well stop at Cleveland or 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mansfield" rel="city">Mansfield</a>, and would like to see you for an hour or so 
to hear your views of the coming events. . . . 
Yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
