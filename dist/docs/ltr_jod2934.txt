MY BEST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
WE have an express to-day from Governor Johnson, Captain Nicholson and several other gentlemen, with an account that the fleet, to the number of two hundred and sixty-three sail, have gone up towards the 
head of Chesapeake bay. They lie over against the shore between the river Sassafras and the river Elk. 
We have also a letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met colleague">General Washington</a> acquainting us, that to-morrow morning at seven o clock, 
he shall march his army through the city of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, along Front street, and then turn up Chestnut 
street in his way to cross over the bridge at Schuylkill 
river; so that General Howe will have a grand continental army to oppose him, in very good season, aided by a formidable collection of militia. I like 
this movement of the General through the city. Such a show of artillery, waggons, light horse and infantry, which takes up a line of nine or ten miles upon their 
march, and will not be less than five or six hours passing through the town, will make a good impression 
upon the minds of the timorous whigs for their confirmation ; upon the cunning Quakers for their restraint ; and upon the rascally Tories for their confusion. 
</p><p>
I think there is a reasonable ground for confidence, with the favor of Heaven, that Howe will not be able to reach this city. Yet I really doubt whether it would 
not be more for our interest that he should come here, and get possession of the town. 
</p><p>
1. Because there are impurities here which will never be so soon or so fully purged away, as by that fire of affliction which Howe enkindles wherever he goes. 
</p><p>
2. Because it would employ nearly the whole of his force to keep possession of this town, and the rest of the continent would be more at liberty. 
</p><p>
3. We could counteract him here, better than in many other places. 
</p><p>
4. He would leave New England and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> at leisure to kill or catch Burgoyne. 
</p><p>
In all events you may rejoice and sing, for the season is so far gone that he cannot remove to you.
