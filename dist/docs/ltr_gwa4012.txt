My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You will have learned from the public gazettes, and 
through other more authentic channels, that all that rested 
with me to do, to give ratification to the treaty between 
this country and Great Britain, is already accomplished. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=top' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Pinckney's</a> absence from the court of London, the information and aids it was expected he would derive from 
Mr. Short's presence at that of Madrid, the pecuniary situation of our affairs in Holland requiring the attention of <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='co-worker met'>Mr. Adams</a> in that country, and the little knowledge we had of 
the character and qualifications of Mr. Deas, have occasioned no little embarrassment in this business. However, a mode is adopted which, I hope, will be effectual. 
</p><p>
It has not been among the smallest of these embarrassments that the domineering spirit of Great Britain should 
revive just at this crisis, and the outrageous and insulting conduct of some of her officers should combine therewith, to 
play into the hands of the discontented, and sour the minds of those who are friends to peace, order, and friendship with all the world. But this by-the-bye. 
</p><p>
The object of this letter is to pray you to aid me with hints relative to those points which you conceive to be lit 
subjects for the further friendly negotiations on the West India trade with Great Britain, agreeably to the recommendation of the Senate ; and which appear to have been 
in contemplation by the concluding part of the treaty signed by yourself and <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague'>Lord Grenville</a>. 
</p><p>
I intended to have asked this favour of you at an earlier day ; but a coincidence of unexpected circumstances has 
involved me in so much business and perplexity, that it has been delayed from time to time (since my arrival in this 
city) until the present moment. But as nothing is now asked that you have not, I am sure, revolved over and 
over again during your negotiation, and since the decision of the Senate thereon, T persuade myself it will require but 
little time for the digest I ask ; and which I beg to receive as soon as you can make it convenient to give me, circumstances rendering it necessary for me to leave this place, if 
possible, on Monday next, for Virginia, in order to bring back my family ; but instructions for the new negotiator must be prepared before I go. 
</p><p>
With great esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
I remain, my dear sir, 
Your affectionate and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="me">George Washington<a/>.
