My dear Maria, 
</p><p>
The account of your health contained in your affectionate 
letter of the 12th inst., gave me great pleasure. 
</p><p>
I thank you for the manner in which you mention my 
birth-day, and I believe every word you say on that topic. 
And now, my dear daughter, I will congratulate you on 
the anniversary of a birth-day, without which all our birthdays would have been but sad. I mean the nativity of our 
Redeemer. May you see many returns of that anniversary, 
and with still increasing prospects of comfort here, and 
happiness hereafter. 
</p><p>
Last evening your sister received a letter from you, with 
a postscript by ****. Let me hint to you, that neither the 
letters which we write, nor those which we receive, should 
be so frequently communicated as to become a matter of 
course; for, in that case, every omission which prudence 
may require, will naturally lead to conjectures and apprehensions, and sometimes to inquiries and piques, which are 
always unpleasant. Although I am persuaded that these 
reflections are not new to you, yet my solicitude about 
whatever may affect your comfort, prompts me to remind 
you of them. Place full confidence in your husband ; with 
respect to others, be habitually circumspect. These are 
mere general remarks, and not dictated by any fear of their 
being necessary. 
</p><p>
I am, my dear Maria, 
</p><p>
Your very affectionate father, 
</p><p>
