Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Whence came the idea, that the moment a minister loses 
a question in parliament, he must be displaced ? That kings 
should adopt such a maxim is not very unnatural, but that 
a free parliament should think an influential dictator < 
them necessary to the government of the kingdom, seems 
rather a new opinion. Perhaps it arose gradually from the 
practices of the court and the decay of public virtue during 
the last hundred years. 
</p><p>
So far as the peace respects France and America, I am 
persuaded it was wise in Britain to conclude it. The 
cessions to France are not, in my opinion, extravagant ; 
and the terms settled with America, m removing all causes 
of future variance, certainly load to conciliation and friendship. 
</p><p>
It appears to me that the discussion of this subject might 
have been more ample and satisfactory. Why was not 
parliament told of our offer i rce, and the mu
tual navigation of the American waters? The word ; 
procity would not then have been deemed so nug 
</p><p>
We have received particular instructions on the business 
of commerce, and Mr. Fitzherbert has been informed of our 
readiness to add to th< isional treaty, an article for 
</p><p>
opening and regulating the trade between us on principles 
as liberal and reciprocal as you please. What more can 
be said or done ? Mr. Pitt's bill was a good one, a wise one, and one that will for ever do honour to the extent and 
policy of his views, and to those of the administration 
undcrwho.se auspices it was formed. For my own part, 
however, 1 think that. America need not be exceedingly 
anxious about the matter; for it will be in our power to 
derive from a navigation act of our own, full as many 
advantages as we should lose by the restrictions of your laws. 
</p><p>
The objections drawn from your treaties with Russia, 
&c. appear to me weak, and have been answered; but 
why not give them similar terms on similar conditions ? 
They furnish you with raw materials chiefly, and you them 
with manufactures only. The gain, therefore, must be 
yours. With respect to carriage and navigation, they stand 
in a very different predicament from us. 
</p><p>
As to the tories who have received damage from us, why 
so much noise about them, and so little said or thought of 
;s who have suffered ten times as much from these same 
tories, not to mention the desolations of an unjust and licentious war. 
</p><p>
We forget our sufferings, and even agree to recommend 
to favour a set of men, of whoi i very few would consider 
the having their deserts in the light of a blessing. How 
does reciprocity stand in this account ? 
</p><p>
Some, it seems, think that New-York should be retained 
as a rod to drive us on in this business of the tories. Strange 
that the idea of driving us should still be entertained. I 
pledge myself to you that, should such a design be adopted 
and become apparent, the refugees will get nothing, and the 
progress of reconciliation will be as slow as the warmest 
Gallican could wish. 
</p><p>
I hear there is to be a Congress here ; that is, that Britain and France have requested the two imperial courts to send 
mediatorial ambassadors here for the purpose of being witnesses to the execution of the definitive treaties ; â€” a very 
important errand, no doubt, and very complimentary to those sovereigns. Is it probable that a Congress should be 
called for that poor, single, simple purpose ? Why your court agreed to it is hard to conceive. 
</p><p>
I have written to my countrymen, that Lord Shelburne's 
system respecting them appeared to me to be liberal and 
conciliatory, but that his hesitations about avowing the 
acknowledgment of our independence discouraged extensive confidence without further facts. I always think it 
best to be candid and explicit. I hope we shall soon be in 
the full possession of our country and of peace, and as we 
expect to have no further cause of quarrel with Great 
Britain, we can have no inducement to wish or to do her 
injury ; on the contrary, we may become as sensible to her 
future good offices as we have been to her former evil 
ones. A little good-natured wisdom often does more in 
politics than much slippery craft. By the former, the French 
acquired the esteem and gratitude of America, and by the 
latter, their minister is impairing it. 
</p><p>
Thus I have written you a hasty letter. Since the 
receipt of yours, until this moment, I have been promising 
myself the pleasure of paying you a visit. I now find it 
probable that I shall be detained here some time longer. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Jay charges me to say civil things to you. You are 
a favourite of hers, and deserve to be so of everybody. 
Our little girl is well, and when able to speak, shall be taught 
to send you her compliments. I shall reply to certain parts 
of your letter in my next ; at present, I am pressed for 
time. I must not, however, forget my worthy friend, Mr. Oswald. He deserves well of his country, and posterity 
will not only approve, but commend his conduct. Assure 
him of my esteem and attachment, and believe me to be, 
with the best wishes for the health and happiness of Mrs. 
Vaughan and your little daughter,
