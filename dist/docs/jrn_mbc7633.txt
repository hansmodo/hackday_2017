<a rel='month origin' value='5'>May</a> <a rel='day origin' value='6'>6th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. Mine is a painful, self-imposed task : but why 
write when I have nothing to chronicle but disaster ? x So I read instead : First, Consuelo, then Columba, two ends of 
the pole certainly, and then a translated edition of Elective Affinities. Food enough for thought in every one of this 
odd assortment of books.

At the Prestons , where I am staying (because Mr. Chesnut has gone to see his crabbed old father, whom he 
loves, and who is reported ill), I met Christopher Hampton. He tells us Wigf all is out on a warpath ; wants them 
to strike for Maryland. The President's opinion of the
move is not given. Also Mr. Hampton met the first lieutenant of the Kirkwoods, E. M. Boykin. Says he is just the 
same man he was in the South Carolina College. In what ever company you may meet him, he is the pleasantest man 
there.

A telegram reads: " We have repulsed the enemy at Williamsburg. Oh, if we could drive them back " to 
their ain countree ! Richmond was hard pressed this day. The Mercury of to-day says, " Jeff Davis now treats all 
men as if they were idiotic insects.

Mary Preston said all sisters quarreled. No, we never quarrel, I and mine. We keep all our bitter words for our 
enemies. We are frank heathens ; we hate our enemies and love our friends. Some people (our kind) can never make 
up after a quarrel ; hard words once only and all is over. To us forgiveness is impossible. Forgiveness means calm in 
difference; philosophy, while love lasts. Forgiveness of love's wrongs is impossible. Those dutiful wives who 
piously overlook well, everything do not care one fig for their husbands. I settled that in my own mind years ago. 
Some people think it magnanimous to praise their enemies 
and to show their impartiality and justice by acknowledging the faults of their friends. I am for the simple rule, 
the good old plan. I praise whom I love and abuse whom I hate.

Mary Preston has been translating Schiller aloud. We are provided with Bulwer's translation, Mrs. Austin's, 
Coleridge's, and Carlyle's, and we show how each renders 
the passage Mary is to convert into English. In Wallenstein at one point of the Max and Thekla scene, I like Carlyle better than Coleridge, though they say Coleridge's Wal4 lenstein is the only translation in the world half so good as 
the original. Mrs. Barstow repeated some beautiful scraps by Uhland, which I had never heard before. She is to write them for us. Peace, and a literary leisure for my old age, unbroken by care and anxiety!

General Preston accused me of degenerating into a boarding-house gossip, and is answered triumphantly by 
his daughters: " But, papa, one you love to gossip with full well."

Hampton estate has fifteen hundred negroes on Lake Washington, Mississippi. Hampton girls talking in the 
language of James's novels : Neither Wade nor Preston that splendid boy ! would lay a lance in rest or couch 
it, which is the right phrase for fighting, to preserve slavery. They hate it as we do." " What are they fighting 
for? ! " Southern rights whatever that is. And they do not want to be understrappers forever to the Yankees. 
They talk well enough about it, but I forget what they say. Johnny Chesnut says : No use to give a reason 
a fellow could not stay away from the fight not well. It takes four negroes to w r ait on Johnny satisfactorily.

It is this giving up that kills me. Norfolk they talk of now ; why not Charleston next ? I read in a Western letter, 
" Not <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a>, but the soldiers who stopped to drink 
the whisky they had captured from the enemy, lost us Shiloh. Cock Robin is as dead as he ever will be now ; what 
matters it who killed him?
