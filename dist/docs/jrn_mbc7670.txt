<a rel='month origin' value='10'>October</a> <a rel='day origin' value='27'>27th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=camden' rel='city origin'>CAMDEN</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1863' rel="origin">1863</a>]. Young Wade Hampton has been here for a few days, a guest of our nearest neighbor and cousin, 
Phil Stockton. Wade, without being the beauty or the athlete that his brother Preston is, is such a nice boy. We lent 
him horses, and ended by giving him a small party. What was lacking in company was made up for by the excellence 
of old Colonel Chesnut's ancient Madeira and champagne. If everything in the Confederacy were only as truly good 
as the old Colonel's wine-cellars ! Then we had a salad and a jelly cake.

<a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>General Joe Johnston</a> is so careful of his aides that Wade has never yet seen a battle. Says he has always happened to be sent afar off when the fighting came. He does 
not seem too grateful for this, and means to be transferred to his father's command. He says,  "No man exposes him 
self more recklessly to danger than <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>General Johnston</a>, and no one strives harder to keep others out of it." But the 
business of this war is to save the country, and a commander must risk his men's lives to do it. There is a French saying 
that you can't make an omelet unless you are willing to break eggs.
