<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='8'>8th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=montgomery' rel='city origin'>MONTGOMERY</a>, Ala., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. Judge Campbell, of the United States Supreme Court, has resigned. Lord! how he must have 
hated to do it. How other men who are resigning high positions must hate to do it.

Now we may be sure the bridge is broken. And yet in the Alabama Convention they say Reconstructionists abound and are busy.

Met a distinguished gentleman that I knew when he was in more affluent circumstances. I was willing enough 
to speak to him, but when he saw me advancing for that purpose, to avoid me, he suddenly dodged around a corner 
William, Mrs. de Saussure's former coachman. I remember him on his box, driving a handsome pair of bays, 
dressed sumptuously in blue broadcloth and brass buttons; a stout, respectable, fine-looking, middle-aged mulatto. He was very high and mighty.

Night after night we used to meet him as fiddler-in-chief of all our parties. He sat in solemn dignity, making faces 
over his bow, and patting his foot with an emphasis that shook the floor. We gave him five dollars a night ; that was 
his price. His mistress never refused to let him play for any party. He had stable-boys in abundance. He was far 
above any physical fear for his sleek and well-fed person. How majestically he scraped his foot as a sign that he was 
tuned up and ready to begin !

Now he is a shabby creature indeed. He must have felt his fallen fortunes when he met me one who knew him in 
his prosperity. He ran away, this stately yellow gentle man, from wife and children, home and comfort. My 
Molly asked him " Why? Miss Liza was good to you, I know." I wonder who owns him now; he looked forlorn.

Governor Moore brought in, to be presented to me, the President of the Alabama Convention. It seems I had 
known him before; he had danced with me at a dancing-school ball when I was in short f Kocks, with sash, flounces, 
and a wreath of roses. He was one of those clever boys of 
our neighborhood, in whom my father saw promise of better things, and so helped him in every way to rise, with 
books, counsel, sympathy. I was enjoying his conversation immensely, for he was praising my father without stint, 
when the Judge came in, breathing fire and fury. Congress has incurred his displeasure. We are abusing one another 
as fiercely as ever we have abused Yankees. It is disheartening.
