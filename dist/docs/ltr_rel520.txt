My Precious Daughter:  I have received your letter forwarded to
Richmond by Mr. Powell, and I also got, while in the West, the letter
sent by B. Turner.  I can write but seldom, but your letters always
give me great pleasure.  I am glad you had such a pleasant visit to
'Kinloch.'  I have passed a great many pleasant days there myself in
my young days.  Now you must labour at your books and gain knowledge
and wisdom.  Do not mind what Rob says.  I have a beautiful white beard.
It is much admired.  At least, much remarked on.  You know I have told
you not to believe what the young men tell you.  I was unable to see
your poor mother when in Richmond.  Before I could get down I was
sent off here.  Another forlorn hope expedition.  Worse than West
Virginia....  I have much to do in this country.  I have been to
Savannah and have to go again.  The enemy is quiet after his conquest
of Port Royal Harbor and his whole fleet is lying there.  May God guard
and protect you, my dear child, prays your
</p><p>
                               Affectionate father,
