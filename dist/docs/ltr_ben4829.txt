DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
It was with great Pleasure I learnt by Mr. Marchant, 
that you & Mrs. Babcock and all your good Family continue 
well & happy. I hope I shall find you all in the same State 
when I next come your Way, and take Shelter as often heretofore under your hospitable Roof. The Colonel, I am told, 
continues an active and able Farmer, the most honourable 
of all Employments, in my opinion, as being the most useful 
in itself, and rend'ring the Man most independent. My 
Namesake, his Son, will soon I hope be able to drive the 
Plough for him.

Clarke, and Mr. Broadstreet are the most popular. And amongst their 
ministers, Mr. Thatcher, Mr. Oxenbridge, and Mr. Higginson.

" There are no musicians by trade. One dancing school was set up, but 
put down. A fencing school is allowed. All cordage, sailcloth, and nets 
come from England. No cloth made there worth above 4'. a yard ; nor 
linen worth above 2s. 6</. No allum, nor copperas, nor salt by the sun.

" They take an oath of fidelity to the governor, but none to the King. 
The governor is chosen by every freeman. A freeman must be orthodox, 
above twenty years of age, and worth about ^200." S.

I have lately made a Tour thro' Ireland and Scotland. 
In those Countries a small Part of the Society are Landlords, 
great Noblemen, and Gentlemen, extreamly opulent, living 
in the highest Affluence and Magnificence : The Bulk of the 
People Tenants, extreamly poor, living in the most sordid 
Wretchedness, in dirty Hovels of Mud and Straw, and cloathed 
only in Rags. 
</p><p>
I thought often of the Happiness of New England, where 
every Man is a Freeholder, has a Vote in publick Affairs, 
lives in a tidy, warm House, has plenty of good Food and 
Fewel, with whole cloaths from Head to Foot, the Manufacture perhaps of his own Family. Long may they continue 
in this Situation ! But if they should ever envy the Trade 
of these Countries, I can put them in a Way to obtain a Share 
of it. Let them with three fourths of the People of Ireland 
live the Year round on Potatoes and Buttermilk, without 
Shirts, then may their Merchants export Beef, Butter, and 
Linnen. Let them, with the Generality of the Common 
People of Scotland, go Barefoot, then may they make large 
Exports in Shoes and Stockings : And if they will be content 
to wear Rags, like the Spinners and Weavers of England, 
they may make Cloths and Stuffs for all Parts of the World. 
</p><p>
Farther, if my Countrymen should ever wish for the honour 
of having among them a gentry enormously wealthy, let them 
sell their Farms & pay rack'd Rents ; the Scale of the Landlords will rise as that of the Tenants is depressed, who will 
soon become poor, tattered, dirty, and abject in Spirit. Had 
I never been in the American Colonies, but was to form my 
Judgment of Civil Society by what I have lately seen, I should 
never advise a Nation of Savages to admit of Civilization: 
For I assure you, that, in the Possession & Enjoyment of the 
</p><p>
various Comforts of Life, compar'd to these People every 
Indian is a Gentleman : And the Effect of this kind of Civil 
Society seems only to be, the depressing Multitudes below 
the Savage State that a few may be rais'd above it. My 
best Wishes attend you and yours, being ever, with great 
Esteem, Dear Sir, etc. B. [FRANKLIN.]
