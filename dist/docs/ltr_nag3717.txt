Sir, 
</p><p>
My letter to Congress, a copy of which I inclose 
to your Excellency, will inform yon of an unsuccessful action with Lord Cornwallis on the 15th. Our 
prospects were flattering ; and had the North Carolina 
militia seconded the endeavours of their officers, victory was certain. But they left the most advantageous position I ever saw, without scarcely firing a 
gun. None fired more than twice, and very few 
more than once, and near one half not at all. The 
Virginia militia behaved with great gallantry, and 
the success of the day seemed to be doubtful for a 
long time. The action was long and severe. 
</p><p>
In my former letters I inclosed to your Excellency 
the probable strength of the British army, since which 
they have been constantly declining. Our force, as 
you will see by the returns, was respectable ; and 
the probability of not being able to keep it long in 
the field, and the difficulty of subsisting men in this 
exhausted country, together with the great advantages which would result from the action, if we were 
victorious, and the little injury, if we were otherwise, 
determined me to bring on an action as soon as possible. When both parties are agreed in a matter, all 
obstacles are soon removed. I thought the determination warranted by the soundest principles of good 
policy, and I hope events will prove it so, though 
we were unfortunate. I regret nothing so much as 
the loss of my artillery, though it was of little use 
to us, nor can it be, in this great wilderness. However, as the enemy have it, we must also. 
</p><p>
Lord Cornwallis will not give up this country 
without being soundly beaten. I wish our force was 
more competent to the business. But I am in hopes, 
by little and little, to reduce him in time. His 
troops are good, well found, and fight with great obstinacy. 
</p><p>
I am very happy to hear the Marquis de Lafayette 
is coming to Virginia, though I am afraid, from a 
hint in one of <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a>'s letters, he will think 
himself injured in being superseded in the command. 
Could the Marquis join us at this moment, we should 
have a glorious campaign. It would put Lord Cornwallis and his whole army into our hands. I am 
also happy to hear, that the Pennsylvania line are 
coming to the southward. The mutiny in that line 
was a very extraordinary one. It is reported here 
to have proceeded from the great cruelty of the officers. A member of Congress writes this j but I believe it to be so far from the truth, that I am persuaded it originated rather through indulgence than 
from any other cause. 
</p><p>
Virginia has given me every support I could wish, 
or expect, since Lord Cornwallis has been in North 
Carolina; and nothing has contributed more to this 
than the prejudice of the people in favor of your 
Excellency, which has been extended to me from the 
friendship you have been pleased to honor me with. 
The service here is extremely severe, and the officers 
and soldiers bear it with a degree of patience that 
does them the highest honor. I have never taken 
off my clothes since I left the Pedee. I was taken 
with a fainting last night, owing, I imagine, to excessive fatigue and constant watching. I am better 
to-day, but far from being well. 
</p><p>
I have little prospect of acquiring much reputation 
while I labor under so many disadvantages. I hope 
my friends will make just allowances ; and as for vulgar opinion, I regard it not. Neither time nor health 
will permit me to write your Excellency upon many 
matters which are upon my mind. I beg my best 
respects to Mrs. Washington. 
</p><p>
With esteem and regard I am, &c., 
</p><p>
