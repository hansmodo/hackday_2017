SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your favor of the 16th. I am sorry to inform you, 
that by a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, of the 15th, the enemy had 
not surrendered. You do me the honor to ask my opinion respecting your future movements. It is needless and impossible 
for me to advise; because, having once settled our plan and 
afterwards deviated from it, the concerting any future measures 
might be productive of ruin to one of us, if deprived of those 
succours and that support, which form a part of the general plan 
of operations. My opinion of your attack at King's Bridge is, 
that it will be utterly inefficacious. 
</p><p>
For the rest, as your operations must be governed by circum 
stances, I can only inform you of facts. <a href='/results.php?city=kingston' rel='city'>Kingston</a> was burnt yesterday afternoon, because I had not troops to defend it. Two 
prisoners tell me that <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> is the enemy's object. If I ad 
vance much farther northward, it will be in the power of the 
enemy to ruin my little corps by landing above and below me, 
as I shall then have the Catskill Mountains to the west, and 
Hudson's River to the east. I expect every instant to hear that 
Rhinebeck is in flames. I have the honor to be, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gec" rel="me">GEORGE CLINTON</a>. 
P. S. I trust you must have received <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>'s letter 
of the 13th, of which he sent me a copy, in which he approves 
of the plan of removing our armies up the river on each side. 
</p>
