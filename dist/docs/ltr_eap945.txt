My Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>:--I received your very welcome letter and I cannot help thinking of one particular sentence you wrote, that I gave you pain when I told you about walking out with Mr. Prizer and Miss Bradshaw. I am very sorry to give you pain, but it was not done intentionally. That you know. I told you because I wished you to know whom I walked out with, not because I thought you selfish by any means. I know you are not.
</p><p>
I know that you have been wanting to go to that tempting place, California, and that you would never
be satisfied if you did not go. So I hope it is all for the best. Well I know you left all that was near and dear to you to go to the gold mines. And well I know that all that is near and dear to me is you. It is so very lonesome here that it seems as though I were in a strange land with no friends. But I have plenty of friends and Mr. Prizer is one of them. You have no idea how I miss you. I have not gone to bed a night since you left here until I prayed to God to bless you and be with you on your long journey, and grant that you may get there safely, that you may have good luck when you get there, that you may return safe, and that you may return soon, in two years if possible. I suppose it will be impossible to return in less. It seems the longest while since you took your departure. And just think! It is only three weeks, and it will be two years before I see you, and maybe not then.

The other day Henry Evans was talking to Father about you and he spoke of you very highly and gave you an excellent character for all the time you were boarding with his family and working in the Record office. But I knew it was all the truth. Your daguerreotype is kept in the parlor and I look at it very often. It is a great comfort to me to think I have the miniature of the only one I love so near to look at. I am going to get a quarter of oil calico to put in my album quilt, and put your name on it. I forgot to ask you for a quarter when you were here, but however, it will be all the same.
</p><p>
I hope you have good books to read. I regret very much that I did not think to give you some books but I was in so much trouble and I felt so badly. I am happy to learn that you have the violins on board to pass the time away, but do not participate too much,
but think of Him that is high in the heavens. You speak of the Captain's treat, brandy and cheese. I hope he may never have another of the kind and I also hope if he does, you will not participate in it. Tell Clinton that I think he will be comfortable and well contented, and a great deal more so after he has been out three or four months. I sincerely hope that you will keep the Sabbath day as it should be kept.

There was a general turnout at the Court House on the Fourth of July, ladies by the plenty. I said to Cad if there were one soldier more among them I could enjoy looking at them. But as it was, I felt miserable all the time I was listening to the reading of the Declaration of Independence.
</p><p>
There have been strange proceedings since you left here. Prizer has left Cad and he gallants Elizabeth Hodgson. I expect he will write to you the whole story.
</p><p>
Mr. Prizer called on me last evening. Part of the subject of conversation was about you, and part about the separation of Caroline and himself. It is the general talk. Cad packed everything Prizer has given her and sent them to him, with the exception of his likeness, and that she said no one should have. She wrote him a note with them and told him that the daguerreotype she was going to keep sacred. He told me he did not understand that, and he says he wants it.
</p><p>
He was also speaking about California, and he said that almost every person thinks I have an investment in the California stock. And he says he is going to send you a letter soon, and will put my letter in with his. I was very anxious to send a letter to you, but Mr. Prizer told me it would get there long before you, so I am contented. I suppose since he has left Cad, he will grant me more favors than ever. But I know I
am gratifying your wishes by accepting them, so I shall. He has been thinking about a ride, getting up a small company and all going in one carriage. How much more I would be able to enjoy it if you were here.
</p><p>
Sarah Cope called here the other evening and we were speaking of Cad and Prizer. She said that Cad had hardly spoke to her for some time and she did not know the reason, but lately she had found out it was because Prizer called on Sarah. Cad tells me she is going to wait until Ruben Haines comes back, because when he left he told her not to get married until he came back.
</p><p>
The other evening Cad and I thought we would be Quakers. So we put on Quaker bonnets and plain shawls, and went up to Polly Hoffinton's. There were four young men there and such laughing you never heard. Cad sent her best regards to you and wished me to tell you that she goes on her own jurisdiction.

Tuesday evening I met Amanda Mercer. Robert Lewis and Atwood Pyle came up. They both said, “Well, Ellen, how do you do?” and I said, “I am pretty well, I believe.” And they both made reply, “I did not expect you would be after the California adventures.” I never said a word, but Amanda answered, “Ellen does not hear when you talk about California.” And so they said no more about it. After they talked with us awhile, Robert said, “Come, Amanda, we will go this way.” And off they started, so I had to follow with Atwood, but I was too angry. I do not wish a gentleman to gallant me about if I can possibly get out of it. I never let them gallant about with me when my only dear was here, and I assure you that I will not while you are away.

Edward Miller was here a little while ago. He said
he expected if you knew he was here you would be persuaded to throw yourself overboard. I told him you would do no such thing, that you were not so jealous as that.
</p><p>
I wish your vessel would hurry and sail to Valparaiso so I could get a letter.
</p><p>
I must close and I am very sorry, but of course I shall write often.
</p><p>
I remain, as ever yours,
</p><p>
