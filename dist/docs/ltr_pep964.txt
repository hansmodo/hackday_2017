My Dear Old Friend:--Some six West Chester boys have returned within a few days. The most of these are much worse off than they were before they started and are now in rather bad health. James Dixon is dead. They are all sick of California. I would not urge you to return--your own judgment will tell you when that is best. But I am thoroughly satisfied that a trip to California is but an adventure, and not of much benefit in a pecuniary sense.
</p><p>
That you continue to preserve your health and will be able to return with your constitution unimpaired is what I devoutly wish. Do not sacrifice your health to pay Mr. Evans. I hope you will be able to return his money as this would not make you feel dependent upon any one. I do sincerely hope ere another year rolls around you will be home among your friends.

The business of the Village Record office is very good, and is still increasing. The editor's eyebrows are
as heavy as ever, though frosted. Quantity and fierceness remain unchanged. Sometimes I am editor, compositor, devil and collector. By continuing in the Record office I may eventually get an interest in it, though of this I am indifferent.
</p><p>
I have more to do now than ever. Thomas Poulson is willing to do anything he is told, but takes his own time to do it. The boys in the office call him "Porkey" on account of getting so fat and snoring so loud when asleep. He also has great difficulty in having his coats made. His legs are so short that the tail will drag on the ground. He says he considers himself one of Delaware's best.

William Baker is a boy to my taste and liking. He is spirited, bold and frank. He says he loves Miss Hodgson as ardently as ever, and she loves him, too, but the pleasures of their love are something like the fruits of the Dead Sea, more to be looked upon than enjoyed.
</p><p>
Your humble servant still retains the cognomen of "Dad" though as yet he is not daddy of anything. I am not prepared to get married and I must stay away from the ladies.

We have had another terrible murder committed in this community. It occurred at Rocky Hill, and was committed on the person of a young lady, a teacher of a public school. The person suspected of the deed is a young man now in prison awaiting a trial. The young lady was deliberately shot down in daylight in front of the school house.

I spent last Friday evening at Apples' and I also saw Ellen in the street last night. I design paying her a short visit this afternoon.
</p><p>
We receive the Sonora Herald. It is a pretty good
paper for the place and opportunities. Do you get the Record?
</p><p>
I am enjoying prime health and getting fat. I also have whiskers. How are you? Have you a beard?
</p><p>
With the warm regards of your old and tried friend,
