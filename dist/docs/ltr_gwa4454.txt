My dear Marquis, 
</p><p>
Your two letters of the 10th came to hand last night. In mine of the 11th, I informed you as fully as it was prudent to do upon paper, that there was at present 
little or no prospect of an operation in the quarter you seem to wish. The contingencies appeared to me so 
remote, in the conversations I had with <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a>, that I could not justify myself in withdrawing a detachment already so far advanced towards the 
point in which relief is immediately and absolutely necessary. 
</p><p>
To have sent the detachment by water would certainly have been in every respect advantageous ; but, 
even supposing M. Destouches should consent to spare the number of ships you mention, would it be safe to 
risk so valuable a body of men, and so unequal a force, in the face of the whole British fleet? We cannot 
suppose their intelligence so bad, but they would have notice of the embarkation, and take measures to intercept it. 
</p><p>
Congress have received information through General Forman, that Sir Henry Clinton means in person to take post upon the Delaware at Newcasde. I have 
heard of no preparation at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> for an embarkation of that consequence, or of any other, and therefore I do not put much confidence in the report, upon 
so large a scale. A party may perhaps be going into the Delaware Bay to interrupt the commerce of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and draw supplies from the disaffected near 
the shores. I expect to hear of some desertions from you in consequence of your move ; but the composition of your troops is good, and, if the officers enter 
upon the service with alacrity, I have no doubt but the men will soon forget their attachments in this 
quarter, and follow cheerfully. I am, &c. 
</p>
