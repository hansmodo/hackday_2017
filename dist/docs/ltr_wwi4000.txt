MY DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am willing to flatter myself you have not quite forgotten 
the person who is new beginning to address you. He certainly has not forgotten you ; on the contrary, he retains a 
lively recollection of the pleasure he derived from your 
society during your residence in this country, and still more 
of the benefit he received, especially on one important occasion, from your judicious and friendly counsel. He has 
never since ceased to embrace every opportunity of inquiring after you, and to take an interest in your well-being. 
</p><p>
After this preamble, I proceed to state, that my object in 
now taking up the pen is, to recommend earnestly to your 
serious perusal and impartial consideration, a pamphlet 
which I will take the liberty of transmitting to you, lately 
published, entitled "War in Disguise, or the Frauds of the 
Neutral Flags." It is spoken of in high terms by the most 
intelligent and respectable men I know, and is written, as I 
think you will agree with me, with considerable knowledge 
of its subject, as well as with great spirit and eloquence. 
Its general tenor is so clearly indicated by its title, at least 
to you who are experimentally acquainted with the topics 
of which it treats, that I need say nothing on that head ; I 
will only beg leave to assure you, that I took it up with 
very strong prejudices against the conclusions which I 
understood the author endeavoured to establish, on account 
of the strong disposition I invariably feel to cultivate and 
promote a friendly connexion between our two countries. 
I cannot but be anxious to hear what reception it meets with 
on your side of the Atlantic. That those whose interest is 
at stake will endeavour to raise a cry, is no more than what 
we must expect. Happy shall I be, if this is countervailed 
by the opposite opinion of men of sense, knowledge, and impartiality. Nothing could have brought me over to the 
doctrines the pamphlet lays down, but a deliberate and firm 
persuasion, that on our practical adoption of them (I would 
not hastily affirm to what extent) depends, according to all 
human appearances, not merely the maritime superiority, 
but the very existence of this empire. The author appears 
to me to have left very short that part of his work in which 
he speaks of the effects, on our marine and our maritime 
interests, of the continuance of the present abuses. The 
work, I happen to know, was written in haste, and in a bad 
state of health ; and though the production of a man who 
was actuated by a sense of duty, and had taken great pains 
to inform himself, it is in some parts faulty, in the composition and language especially ; but knowing to whom I am 
writing, it would be mere impertinence to do more than 
introduce it to your notice. I leave it, not without solicitude, but yet with good hope, to your intelligence, experience, equity, and temper. 
</p><p>
I heartily wish this may find you in the enjoyment of 
good health and personal comfort. You will not, I trust, 
think it improper egotism if, relying on your friendly 
remembrance, I add, that I thank God I am favoured with 
great domestic felicity, â€” having a wife and five children, 
the youngest born only about two months ago. I should 
scarcely know where to leave off, if I allowed myself to 
touch on any of those numerous and interesting topics 
which press themselves on my attention while writing to 
you. I will, however, abstain from them all, and take my 
leave ; assuring you that I am ever, with cordial esteem 
and regard, my dear sir, 
</p><p>
Yours very sincerely, 
</p><p>

P. S. If you do me the favour to answer this letter, my 
address is always London.
