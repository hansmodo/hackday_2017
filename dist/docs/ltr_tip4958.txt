Sir, 
</p><p>
The General. Court of this Colony having, pursuant to 
your request, issued orders for raising upwards of four 
thousand men to serve, in the army that is under your Excellency's immediate command, till the first day of April 
next, and of that number directed that ninety-one be en 
listed in the town of Salem, in consequence thereof the 
militia were mustered and the resolves of the Court read 
to them, and the importance of manning the lines at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a> and Roxbury was urged ; but, great numbers of the 
inhabitants being at sea, many impressed on board the 
British ships, a considerable number in the American armed 
vessels and privateers, one hundred employed as a sea-coast 
guard, and perhaps double that number already in the army, 
of the residue, two or three only presented themselves to 
serve on the common establishment of the army. We were 
therefore induced to try another method, and the Committee 
of Safety gave the enlisting orders to a worthy man and 
good soldier who had served as a Lieutenant in the army 
the last campaign, and offered a month's pay in advance to 
all who would enlist under him. But this measure also 
proved ineffectual. Hence the persons whose names are 
subjoined, inhabitants of the town of Salem, convinced that 
tis of the last importance to the United Colonies, and essential to the safety of this Colony, to defend the lines at Cam 
bridge and Roxbury, have agreed (as tis not in their power 
to do anything more or better) to form themselves into a 
company of volunteers, to serve in the army till the first 
day of April next without pay ; and they now, Sir, beg 
leave to tender themselves to your Excellency, to be employed as you shall think best ; and pray they may, by the 
bearer, who is one of the company, be made acquainted 
with your Excellency's pleasure.
