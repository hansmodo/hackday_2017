Dear Christman:--We have had a streak of information from you through Judge Strickland who received a letter from his relative in California. This stated that you were at work at some place sticking type. I was glad to hear that you were doing something by which we have reason to suppose you can live.
</p><p>
I am afraid that Clinton will never again walk the strets of West Chester, that his bones will rest in California where the remains of thousands of others repose, who left their homes with bright hopes.
</p><p>
There is some stranger stopping in West Chester who resembles you very much. He is about your height, steps as you did, and wears a straw hat like your old one, with the hind part of the rim turned down. When we first saw him, we thought you had taken the wings of the morning and stepped over here to see us.
</p><p>
Since last I wrote you Death has entered Mr. Evans' family, and taken our little Katie away. She died three weeks since of dysentery. We all miss her. She used to sing, "<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="friend met">Enos Christman</a> has gone to Califoria with his washbowl on his knee."
</p><p>
The editor has been away about half the time. We
have a pretty strong force and plenty of advertisements so we are not kept at work very hard. But when I go away there is no person to take hold of things, no leader.
</p><p>
One night some of the boys and I got terribly tight on ale. It was a terrible time. We vomited all over the editor's room in the office. Charles was rich as a Jew, according to his talk. We had an awful time of it finding the way to bed. I was scared next morning. I was afraid the editor would find it out. But he has not. Nobody knew anything of it, but the man in the oyster cellar. I can't bear the sight of ale since.
</p><p>
We have had a few parties and picnics during the season. I have taken a number of pleasant rides with ladies, but I have not squeezed a girl since you left, in spirit and meaning. I spend a great deal of time with Sallie Cope, more as a friend, and for social purposes, than for anything else. True, I have courted her at times, but moderately.
</p><p>
The ladies all want hugging. Mary is in a fair way of being married. When our devil, Mr. Henry C. Darlington, is old enough to "cleave unto woman." He is desperately in love with her. He is one of the finest of fellows, but could not resist her smiles and has become a willing victim. Poor fellow.
</p><p>
I go to market now for the editor and have fine times with the girls, who think I don't know how to market.
</p><p>
There is to be a picnic on the Philadelphia road, towards the city, to which I have an invitation. I have a notion to go and take <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=eap" rel="friend met">Miss Apple</a> and Miss Cope. I called to see Miss Apple last evening.
</p><p>
I might write a great deal more were I certain you would receive this. By the next mail I hope to receive
a letter from you. You need not be alarmed about heaping postage on me. That is nothing. Why, dear fellow, I would do it a thousand times.
</p><p>
Your friend and well-wisher,
</p><p>
