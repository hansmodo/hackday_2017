DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The 24th instant, in the evening, I reached Fort Schuyler, but 
too late, after so fatiguing a march, to pursue the enemy that 
evening. Early the next morning, a detachment of five hundred 
men followed them. Soon after, a heavy rain came on, which 
obliged them to return, excepting a small party, who went to 
the Oneida Lake, where they arrived just in time to see the 
last boats of the enemy going off. The 26th proved a rainy day, 
so that it was impossible for the troops to move until the evening, when I sent off Colonel Livingston's and Colonel Jackson's 
regiments. Yesterday, Bailey's and Wesson's left Fort Schuyler, 
and arrived here last evening. The greatest despatch is made in 
getting their boats over the Falls. 
</p><p>
You may depend on my joining you as soon as possible with 
my detachment, about twelve hundred men. Few Indians will 
be with me. The Oneidas and Tuscaroras, of all the Six Nations, are our only friends. The Commissioners have frequently 
told them that they wished them to observe a strict neutrality, 
and that they would never ask them to take up arms. I found 
their head men determined to follow the advice of the Commissioners ; and therefore I did not urge the young men to join me, 
though I am told by Mr. Deane that most of them may be induced to do it. I have despatched a messenger to them, acquainting them that you wish to see them immediately ; and that, as 
you are a warrior, they might naturally judge of the subject on 
which you would speak to them. 
</p><p>
I have left Gansevoort's and Van Schaick's regiments, consisting of seven hundred men, at Fort Schuyler. One company of the 
latter garrisons Fort Dayton ; and a second, Fort Johnson. They 
are supplied with two months provisions, and a good store of 
ammunition. 
</p><p>
I believe there is nothing to be feared from the enemy in this 
quarter at present. I have made your compliments and done your message to Colonels Gansevoort and Willett. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
