My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
I wrote you a short note a few days since by L&lt; Kilbour who left for 
S Louis on a short sick leave, & a long letter by the mail which left a 
few days before, in answer to your two last, one dated the latter part of 
July, the other the 6 th ult as near as I can recollect, not being able to 
refer to them, as I make it a rule to destroy all private letters as soon as I 
reply to them 
</p><p>
We have this moment rec d information which is thought can be relied 
on from the City of Mexico, across the country by the way of San Luis 
Potosi which is, that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> on the 22 d ult defeated a division of the 
Mexican army, a short distance from the city near 6,000 strong under the 
command of Gen Valencia, killing & capturing nearly the whole, among 
the former was Gen Salas ; if so no doubt he is in possession of the capital ere this ; if not prevented doing so by negotiations for peace ; as soon 
as I learn officially he is in the capital, or negotiating for peace, I shall 
apply to leave for the U. States, & hope to be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> by the first 
of December, if the indulgence is granted 
</p><p>
It is now 22 days since we had a mail from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a>, a stray Delta 
reached here a few days since of the 12th  ult brought to the Brazos by some 
sailing vesel, from which I regretted to see the yellow fever was making 
considerable ravages in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> ; I sincerely hope it will not find its 
way to the Barracks ; but I hope Ann & the children are now comforta 
bly located at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Pascagoula" rel="city">Pascagoula</a> ; where I truly hope there will be nothing contageon or disease of any kin or description I must say I feel great 
uneasiness on your acc f & hope you will use every precaution to keep out 
of all infected places, & if you have to come in contact with that dreaded 
disease you will take every precaution against taking it, as well as to keep 
the system prepared to encounter it should it come. I have written to 
Betty which is herewith inclosed to you, stating should the yellow fever 
make its appearance at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Pascagoula" rel="city">Pascagoula</a>, & they can do no better, they had 
better all go to Fort Pike, where there are good quarters & health, & 
where by getting a few mosquitoe bars, mattrasses & something to eat they 
might make out to spend a short time, until it was safe for them to return 
to Baton Rouge & the Barracks; at the same I hope no such contingency 
will arise 
</p><p>
When you write remember me most affectionately to Ann & the 
children as well as to John & wishing you all continued health & pros 
perity I remain truly your 
</p><p>
Friend
