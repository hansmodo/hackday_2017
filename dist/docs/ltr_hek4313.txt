Sir, 
</p><p>
Yesterday afternoon Mr. Vigo arrived here from 
Fort Washington, and brought despatches from Brigadier-Generals Putnam and Wilkinson to the 9th of 
July, as will appear by the abstracts of Brigadier Wilkinson's letter of the 9th of July, herein inclosed. 
I have the honor to inclose, for your consideration. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>'s letter, giving his opinion of the 
operations proper to be pursued. On this letter I 
shall, by the next post, submit to your view some 
observations. The fate of poor Trueman is but too 
probably sealed, and perhaps that of Hardin too. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>, in his letter of the 5th of July, which principally contains the same information as that mentioned in Wilkinson's letters, states it as his 
opinion, that a treaty ought to be concluded, as soon as possible, with the Wabash Indians, and presents be made. Being firmly persuaded of the soundness 
of this opinion, I shall direct the measure. It is more especially necessary, as Mr. Vigo informs me, 
that the said Indians would not come even to Fort Washington, much less to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. Brigadier Wilkinson's attention to all parts of his duty, and 
his activity, render him a great acquisition to the public.

A banditti, without any fixed residence, consisting of about ten Cherokees, thirty Creeks, and fourteen Shawanese, outcasts from their respective tribes, are 
perpetually committing depredations on the Cumberland settlements. They have lately attacked a military station near <a href='/results.php?city=nashville' rel='city'>Nashville</a>, and carried it. Twentyone men were killed, or taken ; but the Cherokees 
compelled the said banditti to deliver up their prisoners, amounting to six. These are the same rascals, probably, who attacked ]Major Doughty in the year 
<a href='/results.php?year=1789'>1789</a>. I have this information from Mr. Vigo. The necessity of the case will justify the measure of empowering Governor Blount to call out sixty or one 
hundred mounted riflemen, to cut off, if possible, the said banditti. He has that number at present in 
service ; and, as he has been empowered to retain in service as many as he shall judge proper, there can 
be no doubt but he will keep them up as long as necessary.

I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
Hexry Knox.
