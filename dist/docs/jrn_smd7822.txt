We dined at Mrs. Brunot's yesterday, and sitting 
on the gallery later, had the full benefit of a Yankee 
drill. They stopped in front of the house and went 
through some very curious manoeuvres, and then 
marched out to their drill-ground beyond. In returning, the whole regiment drew up directly before 
us, and we were dreadfully quiet for five minutes, 
the most uncomfortable I have experienced for some 
time. For it was absurd to look at the sky, and I 
looked in vain for one man with downcast eyes 
whereon I might rest mine; but from the officers 
down to the last private, they were all looking at us. 
I believe I would have cried with embarrassment if 
the command had not been given at that moment. 
They drilled splendidly, and knew it, too, so went 
through it as though they had not been at it for an 
hour before. One conceited, red-headed lieutenant 
smiled at us in the most fascinating way ; perhaps he 
smiled to think how fine he was, and what an impression he was making.

We got back to our solitary house before twilight, 
and were sitting on the balcony, when Mr. Biddle 
entered. He came to ask if the guard had been 
placed here last night. It seems to me it would have 
saved him such a long walk if he had asked Colonel McMillan. He sat down, though, and got talking in 
the moonlight, and people passing, some citizens, 
some officers, looked wonderingly at this unheard-of 
occurrence. I won't be rude to any one in my own 
house, Yankee or Southern, say what they will. He 
talked a great deal, and was very entertaining; what 
tempted him, I cannot imagine. It was two hours 
before he thought of leaving. He was certainly very 
kind. He spoke of the scarcity of flour in town ; said 
they had quantities at the Garrison, and asked permis 
sion to send us a barrel, which of course we refused. 
It showed a very good heart, though. He offered to 
take charge of any letters I would write ; said he had 
heard General Williams speak of Harry ; and when he 
at last left, I was still more pleased with him for 
this kindness to us. He says Captain Huger is dead. 
I am very, very much distressed. They are related, 
he says. He talked so reasonably of the war, that it 
was quite a novelty after reading the abusive news 
papers of both sides. I like him, and was sorry I could 
not ask him to repeat his visit. We are unaccustomed 
to treat gentlemen that way ; but it won't do in the 
present state to act as we please. Mob governs. 
Mother kept me awake all night to listen to the 
mice in the garret. Every time I would doze she 
would ask, "What's that?" and insist that the mice 
were men. I had to get up and look for an imaginary 
host, so I am tired enough this morning.

Miriam has just got in with all the servants, our 
baggage is on the way, so we will be obliged to stay 
whether we will or no. I don't care ; it is all the same, 
starve or burn. Oh ! I forgot. Mr. Riddle did not 
write that pass! It was his clerk. He speaks very 
grammatically, so far as I can judge! !
