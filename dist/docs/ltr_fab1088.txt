I must not forget to tell you that tomorrow evening we are to have the company of the Heiress, Miss Cornelia Thompson, who is coming to roll bagatelle. Perhaps you heard of her when you were here. She is to have $300,000, only when she is of age. Besides, she is said to be very pretty. I shall endeavor to produce an impression.

Emma is preparing to come out tonight at a great party. Her mother has been employed rigging her for a week past. She is rather young I think, to begin but she has great ideas in her head already about fashion and dress.

The gay season is now at its height. There are twenty or thirty balls given in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a> and Brooklyn every week. If you imagine in Bucksport that the days of balls and dancing belong to the days of our fathers and mothers you have only to spend a week here now to be undeceived. If I only knew how to dance I should take great pleasure in going. I have attended several but I am obliged to walk through the figures and don't get hold of it quite as I thought I could. A friend gave me a ticket for one this morning, next Wednesday at the Shakespearean Hotel, which is going to be a splendid affair.

I have grown to be very domestic lately. I caught a bad cold somehow or other and staid at home seven evenings in succession. I have entirely gotten rid of my cold and got sleep enough to last me a month. But I think it altogether better to stay home. If we only had anything to make home pleasant, I should do so a great deal more, but it is rather dull to sit down all alone and spend the evening when there is so much fun going on around you. I have joined a library in Brooklyn where I can obtain any quantity of books and shall improve my mind part of my evenings at least.
