 My Dear Hubbie:
</p><p>
I think I promised to enclose Lucy's letter in my last but did not will put it in this letter as it gives full account of baby.
</p><p>
I had a letter this morning from Lucy in which she says that the baby is doing fine - sitting in the rocking chair singing as happy as child can be.
</p><p>
She sleeps in our bed quite alone. Lucy sleeping in the next room.
</p><p>
This will be the last letter written from here as I leave here to-night.
</p><p>
Shall sleep with our darling to-night. D.V. They are not expecting me until to-morrow night - so I shall take them quite by surprise.
</p><p>
I visited a lady's studio yesterday, that of Miss. Ransom - perhaps I mentioned it to you. She is a portrait painter. has made it a profession for twenty years she told me. She recommended me to an artist in Chicago whose instruction would be valuable. I do not know if I have mentioned to you that if I can see the way to do it I am [...] to paint with a good artist for a short time this summer - it has been in my mind for a long time. I intend if possible to stop in Chicago a day when I go out.
</p><p>
Miss. Ransom gave me some suggestions in regard to color that I think may be valuable. She had in her studio an immense full length portrait of Sen. Thomas recently painted.
</p><p>
I think I will go to the Dr. office now to get medicine and instructions before leaving. The husband of one of the patients came this morning making me wish mine did too.
</p><p>
Now I think of it - I want to tell you of a syringe that I wish you to get and use for your catarrh (you needn't use if for "weakness") It is marked on the rubber bag which contains the water [...] Syringe - Manufactured by Fairbanke and Co. 121 Court Street, Boston, Mass. If you cannot find it in Savannah a druggist will [...] send for it for you. There are directions how to use it for catarrh - I like it very much. Be sure to buy it.
</p><p>
I think I will call this letter finished and take it with me and post when I reach Wakeman.
</p><p>
Bye Darling,
</p><p>
