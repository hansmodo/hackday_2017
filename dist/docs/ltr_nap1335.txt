Wieletpoo Jan 2 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1837">1837</a>. Universal fast day.
</p><p>
Through the kind Providence of God we are permitted to celebrate this day in heathen lands. It has been one of peculiar interest to us, so widely separated from kindred souls, alone, in the thick darkness of heathenism. We have just finished a seperate room for ourselves with a stove in it, lent by Mr P for our use this winter. Thus I am spending my winter as comfortably as heart could wish, & have suffered less from excessive cold than in many winters previous in New York. Winters are not very severe here. Usually they have but little snow say there is more this winter now on the ground than they have had for many years previous & that the winter is nearly over.   After a season of worship during which I felt great depressure of spirits, we visited the lodges. All seemed well pleased as I had not been to any of them before.
</p><p>
We are on the lands of the Old Chief Umtippe who with a lodge or two are now absent for a few days hunting deer. But a few of the Cayuses winter here. They appear to seperate in small companies, makes their cashes of provision in the fall & remain for the winter, & besides they are not well united.  The young Chief Towerlooe is of another family & is more properly the ruling chief. He is Uncle to the Young Cayuse Halket  now at Red River Mission whom we expect to return this fall & to whom the chieftainship belongs by inheritance. The Old Chief Umtippe has been a savage creature in his day. His heart is still the same, full of all manner of hypocracy deceit and guile. He is a mortal beggar as all Indians are. If you ask a favour of him, sometimes it is granted or not just as he feels, if granted it must be well paid for. A few days ago he took it into his head to require pay for teaching us the language & forbid his people from coming & talking with us for fear we should learn a few words of them. The Cayuses as well as the Nez Perces are very strict in attending to their worship which they have regularly every morning at day break & eve at twilight and once on the Sab. They sing & repeat a form of prayers very devoutly after which the Chief gives them a talk. The tunes & prayers were taught them by a Roman Catholic trader. Indeed their worship
 was commenced by him.   As soon as we became settled we established a meeting among them on the Sab in our own house. Did not think it best to interfere with their worship but during the time had a family bible class & prayer meeting. Many are usually in to our family worship especially evenings, when we spend considerable time in teaching them to sing. About 12 or 14 boys come regularly every night & are delighted with it.
</p><p>
SAB JAN 29 Our meeting to day with the Indians was more interesting than usual. I find that as we succeed in their language in communicating the truth to them so as to obtain a knowledge of their views & feelings, my heart becomes more & more interested in them. They appear to have a partial knowledge of the leading truths of the Bible; of sin, so far as it extends to outward actions, but know [no] knowledge of the heart.
</p><p>
FEB 1st Husband has gone to Walla W to day & is not expected to return untill tomorrow eve, & I am alone for the first time to sustain the family altar, in the midst of a room full of native youth & boys, who have come in to sing as usual.  After worship several gathered close arround me as if anxious I should tell them some thing about the Bible. I had been reading the 12th chap of Acts, & with Richards help endeavoured to give them an account of Peters imprisonment &c, as well as I could. O that I had full possession of their language so that I could converse with them freely.
</p><p>
FEB 18th Anniversary of our marriage. I find it perfectly natural to suffer my thoughts to dwell upon scenes that transpired one year ago from the present time. One year since I have heard a lisp even of my beloved friends in Angelica, & who can tell how many are sleeping in their graves by this time. Ah! it would be like cold water to a thirsty soul indeed, to know how you all do. It is delightful weather now. The
 birds sing sweetly & the frogs croak; familiar sounds these; the same I used to hear in my native land. The Husbandmen are making arrangements for plowing immediately. The snow remained only about six weeks upon the ground. Feb, so far, has been as warm and pleasant as April at home, even more so.
</p><p>
In addition to my other conveniences we have now 3 chairs & a bedstead & all our doors are made & hanging. These are exceedingly comfortable although not of the finest order. My chairs two of them are of my Husband making; with deer skin bottoms woven as the Fancy chairs of the States are & very durable. Our bedstead is made of rough boards & nailed to the wall, according to the fashion of the country. Perhaps a more minute discription of our house is demanded. The upright part is a story & half, faces the east. As I said before the leantoo only is enclosed. The siding is made of split logs fitted into groved posts, & the spaces filled with mud. The roof is made of poles, first covered with straw then with 5 or 6 inches of mud. The fire place & chimney is of the same. The size of the whole building is 30 by 36 feet, the leantoo 12 feet between joints. My room is in the south end of it, a small bedroom & pantry on the north end, and a very pleasant kitchen in the middle. On the west side of the kitchen, is the fireplace with a twelve lighted window on each side, & the outer door. At present the Indians have full liberty to visit the kitchen, but as soon as we are able to prepare a seperate room for them they will not be allowed to come in any other part of the house at all.
</p><p>
You will scarcely think it possible that I should have such a convenience as a barrel to pound my clothes in for washing so soon, in this part of the world, & probably mine with Mrs. Pambran are the only two this side of the Rocky Mountains. I am indebted to her for mine; & she never knew the use of one untill I suggested it. I am not without a dog and good cat even. My dog was a present from Mr. McLeod. These may appear small subjects to fill a letter with, but my object is to show you that people can live here, & as comfortably too as in many places east of the mountains. A few lodges of Indians have come to this place & the whole tribe will be here before many weeks.

MARCH 6th SAB EVE. To day our congregation has increased very considerably in consequence of the arrival of a party of Indians during the past week. A strong desire is manifest in them all to understand the truth & to be taught. Last eve our room was full of men & boys, who came every eve to learn to sing. The whole tribe both men women & children would like the same privaledge if our room was larger & my health would admit so much singing. Indeed I should not attempt to sing with them, were it not for the assistance my Husband renders. You will recollect when he was in Angelica he could not sing a single tune. Now he is able to sing several tunes & lead the school in them. This saves me a great deal hard singing. I have thought many times if
</p><p>
 the singers in my Fathers family could have the same privaledge or were here to assist me in this work how much good they could do. I was not aware that singing was a qualification of so much importance to a missionary. While I was at Vancouver one Indian woman came a great distance with her daughter as she said to hear me sing with the children. The boys have introduced all the tunes they can sing alone, into their morning & eve worship, which they sing very well. To be at a distance & hear them singing them, one would almost forget he was in a savage land.
</p><p>
MARCH 30th Again I can speak of the goodness & mercy of the Lord to us in an especial manner. On the evening of my birthday March 14th we received the gift of a little Daughter a treasure invaluable. During the winter my health was very good, so as to be able to do my work. About a week before her birth I was afflicted with an inflamatory rash which confined me mostly to my room. After repeated bleeding it abated very considerably. I was sick but about two hours. She was born half past eight, so early in the evening that we all had time to get considerable rest that night.
</p><p>
Mrs. Pambran had been with me two weeks previous to this & has been much out of health. She with my Husband dressed the babe. It would have made you smile to see them work over the little creature. Mrs P never saw one dressed before as we dress them having been accostomed to dress her own in the native stile. I was able to lend a helping hand & arranged the clothes for them &c. Between us all, it was done very well. She slept very quiet that night but the next night she cried very hard; all the reason of it was because she was hungry & we did not think to feed her soon enough. On the second day I dressed her alone sitting in the bed, & have ever since. I slept but little the first two nights, but since have got my usual sleep. She is a very quiet child both night & day, sleeps all night without nursing more than once sometimes not at all.
</p><p>
Thus you see Beloved Sisters how the missionary does in heathen lands. No Mother, No Sister, to relieve me of a single care, only an affectionate Husband, who was a Physition & nurse exceeds all I ever knew. He was excessively pressed with care and labour during the whole time of my confinement. Besides the attention I required of him, he had my washing & the cooking to do for the family. (Mrs. P had two children with her & on account of her ill health she could not give much assistance). During the same week we were thronged with company for the whole camp of Indians had arrived. Mr Gray spent several days with us at this time, also Mr Pambran & Mr Ermitinger  paid us a visit on Friday, left on Sat. All this with the care of 4 men & two boys that know little or nothing about work, just as the com mencement of plowing &c requires many steps for one man alone. It was a great mercy that I have been able to take the whole care of my babe & that she is so well & quiet. The Little Stranger is visited daily by the Chiefs & principal men in camp & the women throng the house continually waiting an opportunity to see her. Her whole appearance is so new to them. Her complexion her size & dress & all excite a deal of wonder for they never raise a child here except they are lash tight to a board & the girls heads undergo the flatening process.
</p><p>
I have not yet describe my babe to you. I think her Grand Mother would willingly own her as one of her number of babies, could she see her. Her hair is a light brown & we think will be like her Aunts Jane & Harriet. She is plump & large, holds her head up finely & looks about considerably. She weighs ten pounds.  Tee-low-kike, [Teloukaikt] a friendly Indian, called to see her the next day after she was born; Said she was a Cayuse Te-mi (Cayuse girl) because she was born on Cayuse wai-tis (Cayuse land). He told us her arrival was expected by all the people of the country. The Nez Perces, Cayuses & Walla Wallapoos Indians & now she had arrived it would soon be heard of by them all, & we must write to our land & tell our Parents & friends of it. The whole tribe are highly pleased because we allow her to be called a Cayuse Girl. We have beautiful weather this month. March here is pleasant as May is in New York.
