MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The badness of the weather, and worse roads, have put it 
out of my power to get here before yesterday. A favorable 
wind enabled, the night before, Mr. Carleton to get away, with 
his little garrison on board ten or eleven little vessels, reserved 
for that purpose, and to carry away the powder and other important stores. I don t despair of getting hold of the powder yet. No diligence shall be wanting for that purpose. By 
intercepted letters, I find that <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a> is certainly arrived in the neighbourhood of <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a> ; that the king's friends 
are exceedingly alarmed, and expect to be besieged; which, with 
the blessing of God, they shall be, if the severe season holds off, 
and I can prevail on the troops to accompany me. The Lizard, 
man-of-war, is arrived there; she has brought twenty thousand 
pounds sterling, and one hundred marines. They have had some 
other little reinforcements of recruits for McLean's regiment, and 
artificers, to the amount, in all, including marines and sailors, 
of four hundred and fifty men. One of the brigs is arrived 
with clothing and arms for the faithful Canadians, as Mr. Carleton with propriety terms them. 
</p><p>
This morning we have taken possession of the town ; I send 
you their articles of capitulation, with my answer, and hope it 
may meet with approbation. 
</p><p>
I can t help feeling great uneasiness till I know the determination of the troops with respect to engaging for six months 
longer. I was obliged, at <a href='/results.php?city=st johns' rel='city'>St. John's</a>, to promise all such their dismission as chose it, to coax them to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. 
</p><p>
Indeed, Wooster's regiment showed the greatest uneasiness. 
I make no doubt of retaining as many as will hold the ground 
already gotten ; but it is of the utmost importance to finish this 
business at once, that the Ministry may have no hopes left 
of carrying on their infernal plan in this important quarter. 
At any rate, it will be highly expedient to throw in a large 
body of troops, as soon as the ice will bear, in order to make 
n vigorous attack on <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, before the arrival of succours in 
the spring, should it not fall into our hands this winter ; but, 
should this instance of good fortune crown our labors, some 
advantageous post must be chosen below <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, where a large 
corps of troops, strongly posted, a boom over a narrow channel, and floating batteries, may baffle all attempts from Europe. 
I am told a difficult pass, termed the Travers, will answer this 
purpose. If your health will not permit you to engage in this 
affair, I think Lee ought, by all means, to have the command 
here. I send some choice letters of that worthy and steady 
friend of the Colonies, Brook Watson, whose zeal is only to 
be equalled by his sincerity. You will think them of importance enough, I believe, to be communicated to General Washing ton and the Congress. Your friend, Mr. William Smith, has been pretty well humbugged by this gentleman. 
</p><p>
I am exceedingly sorry Congress have not favored me with 
a Committee. It would have had a great effect with the troops, 
who are exceedingly turbulent, and indeed mutinous. My vexation and distress can only be alleviated by reflecting on the 
great public advantages, which must arise from my unparalleled 
good fortune. 
</p><p>
I shall clothe the troops completely, who engage again. I 
find with pleasure that my politics have squared with the views 
of Congress, and shall lose no time in calling a Convention, 
when my intended expedition is finished. 
</p><p>
Will not your health permit you to reside at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> this 
winter? I must go home, if I walk by the side of the Lake, 
this winter. I am weary of power, and totally want that patience and temper, so requisite for such a command. 
</p><p>
I will take it as a favor, if you will send Harry Livingston 
with your despatches for Congress. 
</p><p>
I wish some method could be fallen upon of engaging gentlemen to serve; a point of honor, and more knowledge of the world, 
to be found in that class of men, would greatly reform discipline, and render the troops much more tractable. 
</p><p>
The officers of the first regiment of Yorkers and artillery 
company, were very near a mutiny the other day, because I 
would not stop the clothing of the garrison of <a href='/results.php?city=st johns' rel='city'>St. John's</a>. I 
would not have sullied my own reputation, nor disgraced the. 
Continental arms, by such a breach of capitulation, for the universe ; there was no driving it into their noddles, that the clothing  was really the property of the soldier; that he had paid 
for it, and that every regiment, in this country especially, saved 
a year's clothing to have decent clothes to wear on particular 
occasions. I am, &c., <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rim" rel="me">RICHARD MONTGOMERY</a>.
