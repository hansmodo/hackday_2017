DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
The resolutions of the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> people concerning trade make a great noise here. Parliament has not yet taken 
notice of them, but the newspapers are in full cry against 
America. Colonel Onslow told me at court last Sunday, 
that I could not conceive how much the friends of America 
were run upon and hurt by them, and how much the Grenvillians triumphed. I have just written a paper for next 
Tuesday's Chronicle to extenuate matters a little. 
</p><p>
Mentioning Colonel Onslow, reminds me of something 
that passed at the beginning of this session in the House 
between him and Mr. Grenville. The latter had been raving 
against America, as traitorous, rebellious, &c., when the 
former, who has always been its firm friend, stood up and 
gravely said, that in reading the Roman history he found it 
was a custom among that wise and magnanimous people, 
whenever the senate was informed of any discontent in the 
provinces, to send two or three of their body into the discontented provinces, to inquire into the grievances complained 
of, and report to the senate, that mild measures might be used 
to remedy what was amiss, before any severe steps were 
taken to enforce obedience. That this example he thought 
worthy of our imitation in the present state of our colonies, 
for he did so far agree with the honourable gentleman, that 
spoke just before him, as to allow there were great discontents 
among them. He should therefore beg leave to move, that 
two or three members of Parliament be appointed to go over 
to New England on this service. And that it might not be 
supposed he was for imposing burthens on others, which he 
would not be willing to bear himself, he did at the same time 
declare his own willingness, if the House should think fit to 
appoint them, to go over thither with that honourable gentleman. Upon this there was a great laugh, which continued 
some time, and was rather increased by Mr. Grenville's 
asking, " Will the gentleman engage, that I shall be safe there ? 
Can I be assured that I shall be allowed to come back again 
to make the report ?" As soon as the laugh was so far subsided as that Mr. Onslow could be heard again, he added, 
"I cannot absolutely engage for the honourable gentleman's 
safe return, but if he goes thither upon this service, I am 
strongly of opinion the event will contribute greatly to the 
future quiet of both countries." On which the laugh was 
renewed and redoubled. 
</p><p>
If our people should follow the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> example in entering 
into resolutions of frugality and industry, full as necessary 
for us as for them, I hope they will among other things give 
this reason, that 'tis to enable them more speedily and effectually to discharge their debts to Great Britain. This will 
soften a little, and at the same time appear honourable and 
like ourselves. 
</p><p>
We have had an ugly affair at the Royal Society lately. 
One Dacosta, a Jew, who, as our clerk, was intrusted with 
collecting our moneys, has been so unfaithful as to embezzle 
near thirteen hundred pounds in four years. Being one of 
the Council this year, as well as the last, I have been employed 
all the last week in attending the inquiry into, and unravelling, 
his accounts, in order to come at a full knowledge of his 
frauds. His securities are bound in one thousand pounds to 
the Society, which they will pay, but we shall probably lose 
the rest. He had this year received twenty-six admission 
payments of twenty-five guineas each, which he did not 
bring to account. 
</p><p>
While attending to this affair, I had an opportunity of looking over the old council-books and journals of the society, 
and, having a curiosity to see how I came in, of which I had 
never been informed, I looked back for the minutes relating 
to it. You must know, it is not usual to admit persons that 
have not requested to be admitted; and a recommendatory 
certificate in favour of the candidate, signed by at least three 
of the members, is by our rule to be presented to the Society, 
expressing that he is desirous of that honour, and is so and so 
qualified. As I never had asked or expected the honour, I was, 
as I said before, curious to see how the business was managed. 
I found that the certificate, worded very advantageously for 
me, was signed by Lord Macclesfield, then President, Lord 
Parker, and Lord Willoughby; that the election was by a 
unanimous vote ; and, the honour being voluntarily conferred 
by the Society, unsolicited by me, it was thought wrong to 
demand or receive the usual fees or composition ; so that my 
name was entered on the list with a vote of council, that I was 
not to pay any thing. And accordingly nothing has ever been 
demanded of me. Those, who are admitted in the common 
way, pay five guineas admission fees, and two guineas and a 
half yearly contribution, or twenty-five guineas down, in lieu 
of it. In my case a substantial favour accompanied the honour. 
</p><p>
Yours etc.

B. FRANKLIN
