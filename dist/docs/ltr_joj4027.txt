Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for your favour of the 21st April, 
which was delivered to me the 27th August. Knowledge 
is essential to the duration of liberty, and Pennsylvania is 
wise in making them both the objects of public care. I 
have read your oration with pleasure. The subject is a 
fine one, the field large, and you have interspersed it with 
useful remarks and entertaining reflections. I put it into 
the hands of the Count D'Estaing and the French ambassador. Thev both said civil things of it. 
</p><p>
The society have done me much honour by placing me 
on the list of their members. I shall endeavour to evince 
the sense I have of it, bv now and then sending them whatever I may find here worth their attention. 
</p><p>
I congratulate you on the glorious spirit spreading from 
your city through America. Your bank is the subject of 
much conversation and encomium, and the patriotism of 
the ladies renders them very celebrated. Such marks of 
union and public spirit are worth a victory. To be respectable abroad, we must be respectable at home, and the 
best way to gain friends is to be formidable to our enemies. 
But you know these things as well as I do, and I am persuaded your endeavours will not be wanting to place our 
country in both these points of light. Dr. Foulke may 
rely on my omitting no opportunity of being useful to him ; 
we must take care of young Americans. Much depends 
on the rising generation, and no pains should be spared to 
render them equal to the task that devolves upon them. 
</p><p>
Be assured that it will give me pleasure to continue this 
correspondence, and that I am, sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
