Dear Brother: ... I would like very much to be 
with you and make the trip, although my tastes might 
lead me to traverse fields and places which have no interest to you ; but Europe, being now the concentrated 
history and civilization of our time, has in every part 
interest enough for all men. I wish, therefore, you to 
tell me of your progress and observations. . . . 
</p><p>
At this moment we are in the midst of a rush to 
Pike's Peak. Steamboats arrive in twos and threes 
each day, loaded with people for the new gold region. 
The streets are full of people buying flour, bacon, and 
groceries, with wagons and outfits, and all around the 
town are little camps preparing to go west. A daily 
stage goes west to Fort Biley, 135 miles, and every 
morning two spring wagons, drawn by four mules and 
capable of carrying six passengers, start for the Peak, 
distance six hundred miles, the journey to be made in 
twelve days. As yet the stages all go out and don't 
return, according to the plan for distributing the carriages; but as soon as they are distributed, there will 
be two going and two returning, making a good line of 
stages to Pike's Peak. Strange to say, even yet, although 
probably 25,000 people have actually gone, we are without authentic advices of gold. Accounts are generally 
favorable as to words and descriptions, but no positive 
physical evidence comes in in the shape of gold, and I 
will be incredulous until I know some considerable 
quantity comes in in the way of trade. 
</p><p>
I keep along still, and shall not even vote till some 
organization arises that is more in accordance with my 
personal convictions, which are more and more strong. 
My idea is that the Southern States should be more 
likened to a man having a deformity, like the fox who 
lost his tail and wanted all others to cut theirs off. They 
think they are best off, or at least are bound to think so ; 
and instead of thrusting the fact before them all the 
time, I would indulge them in their delusion with all the 
philosophy and complacency of a strong man. If they 
attempt to abolish the law about slave trade, vote them 
down without unnecessary debate. If they and committee frame a bill to restrain territorial legislation from 
restricting slavery, vote them down. They have not the 
physical or political power to oppress the free States, 
nor can they afford to disperse their slaves any more. 
Already they have Florida, Arkansas, Texas, and large 
parts of Alabama and Mississippi, with less population 
per area than Mexico or Central America. There is no 
outlet for the negroes of our country ; we have no right 
to displace the population of Mexico to put slaves there. 
Slavery must stay pretty much in its present boundaries 
by the constitution and laws as they now are. 
</p><p>
Whether in the midst of moving battalions, in rattling 
towns, amid the towering Alps, or in sunny Italy, you 
must think of us out here on the pampas of Kansas. 
Your affectionate brother,
