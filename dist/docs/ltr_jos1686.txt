Dear Brother : . . . You will have noticed that my name 
is connected with the Reconstruction Law. I did nothing 
but reduce and group the ideas of others, carefully leaving open to the South the whole machinery of reconstruction. The bill was much injured by the additions in 
the House, but, after all, there is nothing obnoxious to 
the South in it but general suffrage. This they must 
take, and the only question is whether they will take it 
in their own way by their own popular movements, or 
whether we shall be compelled at the next session to 
organize provisional governments. I hope and trust they 
will learn wisdom from the past. Can't you in some 
way give them that advice? Three years ago they hated 
you and Johnson most of all men ; now, your advice goes 
farther than any two men of the nation. We will adjourn soon until November next. The impeachment 
movement has, so far, been a complete failure. Butler 
and Logan are reinforcements, but will effect nothing.

The President has only to forward and inforce the law 
as they stand, and he is safe. He ought not to, and 
must not stand in the way of the determined movement 
to recognize the rebel States. He has had his way and 
it failed; he ought now fairly to try the Congressional 
way. I think some of going to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> in April. I am 
tendered an honorary membership of the commission, 
and a free passage. The occasion is tempting; if I go, 
it will be about the middle of April. 
</p><p>
Affectionately,
