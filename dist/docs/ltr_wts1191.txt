Dear Brother : I don't know what <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant</a> means by his 
silence in the midst of the very great indications of his 
receiving the nomination in May. Doubtless he intends 
to hold aloof from the expression of any opinion, till the 
actual nomination is made, when, if he accepts with a 
strong Eadical platform, I shall be surprised. My notion 
is that he thinks that the Democrats ought not to succeed to power, and that he would be willing to stand a 
sacrifice rather than see that result. ... I notice that 
you Republicans have divided on some of the side questions on impeachment, and am glad you concede to the 
President the largest limits in his defence that are 
offered. I don't see what the Republicans can gain by 
shoving matters to an extent that looks like a foregone 
conclusion.

No matter what men may think of Mr. Johnson, his 
office is one that ought to have a pretty wide latitude of 
opinion. Nevertheless the trial is one that will be 
closely and sternly criticised by all the civilized 
world. . . .

Your brother,
