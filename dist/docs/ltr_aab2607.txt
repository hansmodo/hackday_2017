</p><p>
I have barely time, by the opportunity of Mr. Tyrrell, to assure you and Mrs. Blennerhassett of my devoted 
attachment and regard, and to express my sympathy for all the vexations you have encountered. Mr. Tyrrell will 
tell you of all the strange things which are passing here. Of the bills, the first which you indorsed has been paid 
by <a href="/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin">Mr. Alston</a>. The $10,000 indorsed at <a href="/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a> are 
in the hands of an agent with whom I am in negociation at this place. That which was left with Mr. Luckett has 
not, to my knowledge, been negociated. Within a few months after my release from this place, I may hope to 
be in cash for all these and some other purposes. 
</p><p>
May God preserve you and yours in health and spirits.
