<p><i>[Biographer's note: My father had a strong desire at this time to write a history of his
campaigns.  I think, however, he gradually gave it up when he saw the
great difficulties to be overcome and the labour required to produce
anything worthy of the subject, especially as he began to realise
that his strength was slowly failing--a fact which his letters indicate.
Just after the cessation of hostilities, he had taken some preliminary
steps toward acquiring the necessary material.</i>

Here is another letter to General Early, written March 16th, containing
references to the same subject, and to two letters of General Early
which had been published in the papers.  It is interesting, also, as
showing his moderation in speaking of those who had misrepresented
his words and acts:]</i>
</p><p>
My Dear General:  I am very much obliged to you for the copies of my
letters, forwarded with yours of January 25th.  I hope you will be
able to send me reports of the operations of your commands in the
campaign, from the Wilderness to Richmond, at Lynchburg, in the Valley,
Maryland, etc.; all statistics as regards numbers, destruction of
private property by the Federal troops, etc., I should like to have,
as I wish my memory strengthened on these points.  It will be difficult
to get the world to understand the odds against which we fought, and
the destruction or loss of all returns of the army embarrass me very
much.  I read your letter from Havana to the New York Times, and was
pleased with the temper in which it was written.  I have since received
the paper containing it, published in the City of Mexico, and also
your letter in reference to Mr. Davis.  I understand and appreciate
the motives which prompted both letters, and think they will be of
service in the way you intended.  I have been much pained to see the
attempts made to cast odium upon Mr. Davis, but do not think they will
be successful with the reflecting or informed portion of the country.
The accusations against myself I have not thought proper to notice, or
even to correct misrepresentations of my words or acts.  WE SHALL HAVE
TO BE PATIENT and suffer for awhile at least; and all controversy, I
think, will only serve to prolong angry and bitter feeling, and postpone
the period when reason and charity may resume their sway.  At present,
the public mind is not prepared to receive the truth.  The feelings
which influenced you to leave the country were natural, and, I presume,
were uppermost in the breasts of many.  It was a matter which each
one had to decide for himself, as he only could know  the reasons
which governed him.  I was particularly anxious on your account, as
I had the same apprehensions to which you refer.  I am truly glad that
you are beyond the reach of annoyance, and hope you may be able to
employ yourself profitably and usefully.  Mexico is a beautiful
country, fertile, of vast resources; and, with a stable government
and virtuous population, will rise to greatness.  I do not think that
your letters can be construed by your former associates as reflecting
upon them, and I have never heard the least blame cast by those who
have remained upon those who thought it best to leave the country.  I
think I stated in a former letter the reasons which governed me, and
will not therefore repeat them.  I hope, in time, peace will be restored
to the country, and that the South may enjoy some measure of prosperity.
I fear, however, much suffering is still in store for her, and that
her people must be prepared to exercise fortitude and forbearance.
I must beg you to present my kind regards to the gentlemen with you,
and, with my best wishes for yourself and undiminished esteem, I am,
</p><p>
                       Most truly yours,
</p><p>
