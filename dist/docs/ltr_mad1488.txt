DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 31st of January was safely 
brought by Mr. Thompson. That of the 7th instant came by 
yesterday's mail. The anecdote related in the first was new to 
me, and if there were no other key, would sufficiently decipher 
the implacability of the party triumphed over. In answer to 
the second, I can only say at this time, that I feel deeply for 
your situation,! that I approve of the choice you have made 
among its difficulties, and that every aid which can depend on 
me shall be exerted to relieve you from them. Before I can 
take any step with propriety, however, it will be expedient to 
feel the sentiments of Congress, and to advise with some of my 
friends. The first point may possibly be brought about by your 
letter to the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, which I suppose came 
too late yesterday to be laid before Congress, but which will, 
no doubt, be handed in this morning. 
</p><p>
The time of Congress since you left us has been almost exclusively spent on projects for a valuation of the land, as the 
federal articles require, and yet I do not find that we have got 
an inch forward towards the object. The mode of referring 
the task to the States, which had at first the warmest and most 
numerous support, seems to be in a manner abandoned, and 
</p><p>
t Untoward detention at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=annapolis" rel="city">ANNAPOLIS</a>, whither <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="friend colleague met">Mr. Jefferson</a> had gone to embark 
for Europe as one of the commissioners to treat of peace. 
nothing determinate is yet offered on the mode of effecting it 
without their intervention. The greatest misfortune, perhaps, 
attending the case is, that a plan of some kind is made an indispensable preliminary to any other essay for the public relief. I 
much question whether a sufficient number of States will be 
found in favor of any plan that can be devised, as I am sure 
that in the present temper of Congress a sufficient number 
cannot, who will agree to tell their constituents that the law 
of the Confederation cannot be executed, and to propose an 
amendment of it. 
</p><p>
Congress yesterday received from Mr. Adams several
dated September, not remarkable for anything unless it be a 
fresh display of his vanity, and prejudice against the French 
court, and his venom against Doct. Franklin. Other preparations for the post do not allow me to use more cypher at present. 
</p><p>
I have a letter from Randolph dated February 1, confirming 
the death of his aunt. You are acquainted, no doubt, with the 
course the estate is to take. He seems disposed, in case he can 
make a tolerable compromise with his father's creditors, to 
resign his appointment under the State, and go into the Legislature. His zeal for some Continental arrangement as essential 
for the public honor and safety forms at least one of his 
motives, and I have added all the fuel to it in my power. 
</p><p>
My neglect to write to you heretofore has proceeded from a 
hope that a letter would not find you at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, and no subject has occurred for one of sufficient importance to follow you. 
You shall henceforward hear from me as often as an occasion 
presents, until your departure forbids it. 
</p><p>
The ladies and gentlemen to whom I communicated your 
respects return them with equal sincerity, and the former, as 
well as myself, very affectionately include Miss Patsy in the 
object of them. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your sincere friend. 
</p>
