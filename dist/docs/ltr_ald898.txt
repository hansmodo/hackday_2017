DEAR Free Trader --I think the last time I wrote you was from my fortress on Mud Hill (the first mountains from the Valley below my winter quarters), where I lay mud-bound watching " the sun by day and the moon by night" for a propitious moment when I might slide home between the showers. The time at length arrived when the road became firm enough to entitle it to the name of terra firma, and I moved my boots with my wagon and its load of truck and plunder to Dawlytown. There, to compensate me for the weeks of toil I had endured in getting up from the city, the pleasant bath I took in the Yuba, where I very nearly lost my life, wagon, goods and cattle, another three weeks of repose was decreed me by the Fates in the shape of neuralgia, with which I suffered all the pain of "Goblins damned," but which Dr. Willoughby assured me would leave me in better health than I had seen for years. Thus far his predictions have been verified, and I am now capable of enduring more fatigue than I ever was before, and Heaven knows I have encountered it. An excursion in the mountains about the 1st of January followed, which occupied a week, during which it rained night and day constantly, and increased the weight of our packs most sensibly, although "we carried weight" without it, consisting of seven days' rations (which we ate up in six, and feasted on cold water on the seventh), our firearms, ammunition and prospecting tools. We penetrated about fifty miles among the hills, wading through snow, fording streams deeper than our boots, clinging to rocks in passing precipices, keeping a good lookout for the natives, who were ready to "pink" us if caught napping, and faring sumptuously upon hard bread.
</p><p>
I made one happy discovery--that the mountains are decidedly the most cold-water country I ever saw, and I give it as my decided opinion--mark me--it is only my own private opinion from which
all men may differ--that temperance societies are not needed in those elevated ranges, that it is wholly useless to preach temperance principle upon those mountain peaks. I arrived at this important conclusion from two simple facts--first, because there are neither grog shops nor people there, and second, the most confirmed tippler cannot carry enough of the "ardent" with him to last a week, and he is compelled to use no other beverage than pure cold water. We finally made a claim on two bars on the South Fork of Feather River which are held by our company of nine men and where we are now engaged in the work which brought us to California. These bars of which I speak are low places along the river bank where a deposit of sand, gravel and loose rock was made by the water and where an opportunity is given to cut a race by which to drain the stream from its bed. The gold, being deposited from the hills by the rains and mountain rills into the river, is carried by the current into eddies, holes or pockets, so that it is generally found most abundant in the main bed of streams, and when the water can be turned off it has generally been found to yield a golden harvest. Of course these bars are sought for and it is considered fortunate to obtain one. The South Fork of Feather River had been but little prospected until late last fall, and as late as December there were but three or four cabins for the distance of twenty miles above Dawlytown. I started out the moment my health permitted, though at great risk, the second day of January, when to our great surprise we found a cabin nearly every mile and sometimes little settlements of five to ten houses, so great had been the rush up to the Fork when its deposits became known.--These were almost wholly those persons who had remained on Long's and Bidwell bars (the latter where I made my first debut ) and who had supplied themselves with provisions to remain in the mountains during the winter, thus having the advantage of those who might come on in the spring. When I arrived at Bidwell's or Dawlytown from my last trip to the city, a great change had taken place. Tents and people had disappeared, and the population was reduced nearly three fourths, but on going up the Fork I found a great part of our old friends in various locations, living snugly in comfortable log cabins on their claims. The utmost respect is paid by miners to each other's claim. Some little difficulty occurred last fall between two companies respecting the right to a claim or a portion of it, when a general convention was called at the Oregon Bar on the South Fork on New Year's day, for the purpose of defining what constituted a claim and to have a general and mutual understanding with regard to each other's rights. Among intelligent and liberal men, this matter was soon settled upon just and equitable principles.
</p><p>
Every man or company making a claim to a bar or to portions, to put up three written notices giving the boundary of his claim. He
</p><p>
then must take actual possession within ten days and commence his work in some tangible form so that it was apparent he would be a bona fide occupant and not claim to the exclusion of others. He then registered his name or bar on the books of the Association (thus formed) and became a member, and in the event of others attempting to drive him off, he was entitled to the protection of all the companies constituting the Association. He was allowed all the bed of the stream which he drained to a medium stage of water and then ten feet front and thirty back from that point. This is a general outline of the plan, although there are of course a few minor details as the condition of things required, but this is looked to and spoken of along the river with as much deference and respect as if it was the law of the land. Indeed, as things are now situated in the mines, an action of Congress or of our own Legislature is wholly unnecessary, and if either undertakes to erect a Miners' Code without practical experience, I shall then look for difficulties which will not occur so long as the miners are left to themselves
</p><p>
As soon as we made our claims, we commenced preparations to establish them; in due time our cabins were built, although we had to pack our provisions about fifteen miles, over hills that a mule could scarcely pass, and our two races are nearly completed, ready to put in our dams as soon as the spring floods subside. I never was so much exposed, never worked so hard, never fared so roughly as I did during those preliminary arrangements, and it seemed as if my health and strength gained with the emergency, and I now find myself in more comfortable quarters than I have been in since I have been in California.
</p><p>
Time will not permit me to give you an account of the flood this winter, but I will simply say that from a high mountain, from which I had an extended view, I estimated that at least one quarter of this Earthly Paradise, this charming and fertile Valley (oh!) was under water. Hundreds of cattle and mules were drowned and floated down to rejoice with the aromatic scent of their putrid carcasses the refined olfactory nerves of the citizens of Sacramento and other towns springing up on the River--(where's Mr. Bryant?), and the loss of property in Sacramento City by the overflow has been very great. For a particular description of the scene here I must refer you to the N. O. True Delta, whose able and talented correspondent was an eye-witness Among the indignants of the city when the flood was bearing off tents, houses, &c., the Methodist church turned around on its foundation like a dancing master on his heel as if in
high dudgeon to enquire of the neighboring dwelling as they were about departing:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Ye graceless chiefs, where are ye goin'<br/>
    While I am here sae busy sowin'?--( Burns --not quite),
</blockquote>

<p>
and a steamboat has put a blush on all the canals in Amsterdam, for it actually puffed through the main street and discharged its cargo into Starr, Bensley and Company's store
</p><p>
Learning that a "change came o'er the spirit of my dream" with regard to the honesty of some of our Californians, and that they were stealing cattle on the plains, with a Digger-like propensity, to supply the places of their own lost ones, I thought it best to go "down into Egypt" and look after my own, which had been turned out after I reached Dawlytown in the fall. I succeeded in finding three and, driving them back, brought my wagon to the Valley, and disposed of the whole concern, believing that my prospects in the mines are better than trading. As I had to come halfway to Sacramento to find a market I just kept on to see if it were not possible to find a letter from home. I may as well say that I have been disappointed, and the only letter which I have received since I left Ottawa from any friend was one from my wife dated August 25. This I walked fifteen miles to get when I heard of the arrival of the Express a week ago, and I would have walked a hundred for another with the greatest pleasure.
</p><p>
I have written the Free Trader by every opportunity while cross-the plains, have sent a full (or nearly full) copy of my journal from leaving the Missouri up to my arrival in California, and several other letters, and I have not received even a paper from Ottawa. Of course this must be the fault of the mails, and not of my friends. I arrived here day before yesterday at night.--Yesterday morning on going into the street I met Charles Fisher, William Irwin, Captain Reed and S. B. Gridley from Ottawa, Mr. Reynolds, and
</p><p>
William Miller, from South Bend, Indiana, and Colonel Wilson, from Mishawaka, Indiana By some of them I heard of the Dayton Company, who have done very well in the mines, and of Mr. Fredenburg and B. K. Thorn. The latter I was glad to hear was doing well. As a general thing those who have staid in the mines, worked steadily, and have not run about prospecting all over the country, have done something. Those of our South Bend friends that I have met have done something--some of them well.--I met Mr. Rood on my way down.--He was going to the Yuba mines in high spirits. He has located himself at Vernon, twenty-five miles above this place, and is well satisfied with what he has done and is doing. W. McNeil is with me (in the mines), a kind-hearted, generous man--as good a fellow as ever trod shoe leather--"may he live a thousand years." This is about all the personal news I can give of interest in your community--except the death of James Bacon--he died a short time ago in Yubaville. I was much surprised on coming to the Valley to see the change which a few weeks have wrought by our indefatigable Anglo-Saxons. When I made my trip down from Lawson's in September, there were but three houses or ranchos on the road, a distance of perhaps an hundred and twenty or twenty-five miles. There may have been half a dozen on and off the road in the Valley. Now there is a house every five or six miles, not only on the road where water can be obtained even where the land has been overflowed, but from Vernon down houses appear nearly every mile, and I was assured that this was the case at least seventy miles above Lawson's.
</p><p>
New towns are springing up, defective as titles are, and business seems thriving in them all. On reaching the Yuba, I found the town of Marysville, where three months ago only an adobe house existed; a mile below on the Feather is Yuba City, which at that time did not contain a house; two miles below this Eliza, just commenced and buildings going up rapidly; at Bear Creek, where I lost an ox last fall in a swamp, a town plot is being surveyed, and at the mouth
of Feather River, where late in the fall only a ranch existed, Nicolaus is laid out, houses going rapidly up, and lots selling off like hot cakes At the upper towns lots sell for from five hundred to three thousand dollars, and so with the lower towns. Although this city has been under water, lots are still advancing and improvements going on continually. A levee will be built around it to keep out the floods, and it must always be a town of importance, but in all these places the time will, must, come when the bubble will burst and many individuals be ruined.
</p><p>
During the flood a large portion of the Valley was overflowed between the Yuba and Bear Creek. A Mr. Spencer, at whose house I stopped in my peregrination, told me he was obliged to crawl onto the roof of his house to save himself, although it stands at least thirty feet above the river, and that a neighbor sailed in a boat back to the mountains, some twelve or fifteen miles.--Now, the roads are good, the grass green, and the plain dotted with herds of cattle, where a few days ago all was a wide waste of turbid water.
</p><p>
And this is the charming Valley you have read so much of at home, as surpassing everything else in loveliness. I am much amused at the sage remarks of some of the New York editors, respecting California. In speaking of the gold after its exhaustion, they dilate upon its agricultural capacities, its central position, its high destiny, &c. (Well, I reckon it is about in the middle of the earth, if you begin to measure exactly opposite, &c.) It is no more fit for farming purposes than I am for preaching. Exhaust the gold and it will no longer attract ships to its shore only to carry back the poor devils who are caught here in search of El Dorado, and instead of ships taking in cargoes of tea at San Francisco, they will quietly pursue their way from the Atlantic ports through the Isthmus canal, if it is built; if not, around the Cape, wind and weather permitting, to Canton, and receive their lading as usual from the brother of the sun and moon, and seven stars, and other planets. But as the auctioneer says, "I can't dwell;" nobody will believe it till they come and see--come then and get all the gold you can, for sure enough that is here, if you can get it; then you may talk understandingly of its high destiny and superior advantages over your really rich, beautiful and fertile prairies at home. Had I not seen them I might have thought the Valley of the Sacramento beautiful, but I have seen them.--Beauty is a comparative quality, and by that standard I judge.
</p><p>
Among the most pleasant acquaintance which I have formed in this "never-saw-the-like country" is that of Joseph Grant, Esq., the accomplished correspondent of the True Delta
</p><p>
Misery makes strange bedfellows, saith the adage, and a day's walk together in the mountains during the rains, and a night spent in company at my ranch on Mud Hill, opened the door of our hearts, and we walked into an intellectual feast that I shall never forget. I do not mean to eulogize any man, but here where there are so many castes, shades and qualities, and when hardships have been mutually endured, and you find a man stands upon his own bottom through it all without flinching, your heart will warm towards him in spite of you. Picture to yourself a well-educated, well-bred, open-hearted gentleman, one of much thought, originality of mind, just conceptions, with a rare knowledge of human nature as it is, dress him up in a California suit with a blanket strapped to his back, and a bag of hard bread and raw pork under his arm, and put him to climbing high hills or driving into deep gorges in a pouring rain, and you have Colonel Grant in the mountains.
</p><p>
Take the same person in the city, gathering a crowd around him by original and droll harangues, raising a laugh by his witticisms, assuming a care-for-nothing demeanor, selling city lots, holding rancho meetings of his own appointment, where he elects himself President, Secretary, committee of the whole, and keeps a large audience amused and interested two hours on a stretch by his oddities, leaving you to doubt whether his eccentricity is real or feigned, while he sells you a town lot or a package of papers. While you may be conning it in your mind, he may offer you a paper to relieve someone in distress, for some charitable object, something of paramount good, and here you cannot doubt his real feelings, for nature is in it, and you find yourself obliged to respect him at home. Then to his personal friends--if he ever gets rich, and I think he is in a fair way to, he will want to make them rich too. You will never find the author of those letters in the street, nor the odd eccentric in the study. The body may be visible along the sidewalk, but the author and man of reflection is at home in the social circle.
</p><p>
A queer portrait, isn't it? but I believe it a just one and I value his acquaintance for his real talents and kindness.
</p><p>
A droll misfortune occurred a few nights ago to a miner three or four miles from us. He lay sleeping in his tent on the ground, when he was awakened by something twitching his pantaloons. Opening his eyes, he saw a wolf of the coyote species with his purse containing two or three hundred dollars in gold dust in his mouth. He sprang up, but the varmint ran off clear with the purse, and the poor fellow lost it entirely. The purse was made of dried deerskin and he supposes had partially worked out of his pocket as he lay on the ground, and the wolf, smelling the skin, seized it and drew it out and was off before the man could collect himself sufficiently to rescue it.
</p><p>
A good joke occurred not long since, illustrating life in California
this winter. During the rains, boats occasionally ascend Feather River with supplies nearly to the mountains. My neighbor and friend, Mr. Dawly, who is trading, has associated with a jovial, good-hearted man yclept Captain Freeland, late of the U. S. Army, and as brave a man as any who was at the storming of Chapultepec. They have a boat on the river, and Captain Freeland happened to be below and on his way to the city. One afternoon the hands on board wanted some fresh meat, and Freeland and the captain of the boat went on shore to try to kill a deer. A short walk brought them to the open plain where they discovered two men butchering a wild ox. "Ah, my fine fellow, we've caught you at it," shouted Freeland. "We have you now sure enough." Much to his surprise, the two men seized their arms, &c., and started off at full run across the plain. The secret was out. They had stolen the ox, and supposing Freeland and his companion to belong to the ranch and the owners, they took to their heels. Freeland and the captain walked up and finished the butchering and took possession of the beef and carried it to the boat and were supplied with all the fresh meat they wanted for many a day. My time has expired, and I can give you no more on dits now. You will hear from me from time to time. Direct your papers and letters to me at Sacramento City--I may stand a remote chance of getting them.
</p><p>
Truly yours,
</p><p>
