MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I received yours of February 13th, and was happy 
to learn that you and your little ones were well. I 
wrote to you by the Chief Justice, and sent your silk 
by him. He promised me to visit you, and from 
him you will learn how we all are. We have had, 
ever since this month began, a succession of bad 
weather, and, for this week past, the coldest weather 
that I have experienced this winter. The ground is 
now covered with snow. This, if it would last, 
would let me out of my cage, and enable me to go 
to the assembly on the birth-day of the President, 
which will be on Tuesday next. On Thursday last 
I dined with the President, in company with the 
ministers and ladies of the court. He was more 
than usually social. I asked him after Humphreys, from whom I knew he had received despatches a 
few days before. He said that he was well, and at 
Lisbon. When I returned home, I told your father 
that I conjectured Mr. Humphreys would be nominated for Lisbon, and the next day the Senate received a 
message, with his nomination, as resident minister at 
the Court of Portugal ; the President having received 
official information that a minister was appointed 
here, Mr. Friere, as I before informed you. He 
asked very affectionately after you and the children, 
and at table picked the sugar-plums from a cake, 
and requested me to take them for master John. 
Some suppose, that, if your husband was here, he 
would have the command of the troops which are to 
be raised and sent against the Indians. If such an 
idea as that is in his mind, I am happy that your 
friend is three thousand miles distant. I have no 
fancy that a man, who has already hazarded his life 
in defence of his country, should risk a tomahawk 
and scalping-knife, where, though a conqueror, no 
glory is to be obtained, though much may be lost. 
I most sincerely hope he may be successful in his 
private enterprise ; for the way to command Fortune is to be as independent of her as possible. 
</p><p>
The equanimity of your disposition will lead you 
to a patient submission to the allotments of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>. The education of your children will occupy 
much of your time, and you will always keep in 
mind the great importance of first principles, and 
the necessity of instilling the precepts of morality 
very early into their minds. Youth is so imitative, 
that it catches at every thing. I have a great opinion 
of Dr. Watte's " Moral Songs for Children." They 
are adapted to their capacities, and they comprehend all the social and relative duties of life. They 
impress the young mind with the ideas of the Supreme Being, as their creator, benefactor, and preserver. They teach brotherly love, sisterly affection, and filial respect and reverence. I do not 
know any book so well calculated for the early period 
of life ; and they may be made as pleasant to them, 
by the method of instructing, as a hundred little stories, which are taught them, containing neither a rule 
of life, nor a sentiment worth retaining, such as little 
John will now run over, of " Jack aud Jill," and 
" Little Jack Horner." As a trial of their memory, 
and a practice for their tongues, these may be useful, 
but no other way. 
</p><p>
I am sometimes led to think that human nature is 
a very perverse thing, and much more-given to evil 
than good. I never had any of my own children so 
much under my eye, and so little mixed with other 
children or with servants, as this little boy of yours. 
Whatever appears is self-taught, and, though a very 
good boy and very orderly, he frequently surprises 
me with a new air, a new word, or some action, that I 
should ascribe to others, if he mixed with them at all. 
He is never permitted to go into the kitchen. Every day, after dinner, he sets his grandpapa to draw 
him about in a chair, which is generally done for 
half an hour, to the derangement of my carpet and 
the amusement of his grandpapa. 
</p><p>
Remember me affectionately to all inquiring friends. 
I hope to see you ere long. 
</p><p>
Your ever affectionate mother, 
</p><p>
A. Adams.
