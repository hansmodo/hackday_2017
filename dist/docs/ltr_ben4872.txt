MY DEAR CHILD : I received yours of Oct. 14, and one 
without Date which I suppose to be written since. Capts. 
All, Osborne, and Sparkes are arrived ; and a Barrel of Apples 
with another of Cranberries are come, I know not yet by 
which of them. 
</p><p>
I am glad to hear you continue so well, and that the Pains 
in your Side and Head have left you. Eat light Foods, such 
as Fowls, Mutton, etc., and but little Beef or Bacon, avoid 
strong Tea, and use what Exercise you can ; by these Means 
you will preserve your Health better, and be less subject to 
Lowness of Spirits.

It seems Polly Pitts is really dead. I suppose you know 
that we have a Mortgage on her Lotts? Mr. Galloway 
took it for me. You do not tell me whether any thing has been done about it ; or whether any Interest was ever paid. 
Nor have you ever told me whether Mr. Maugridge's Executors have paid off his Mortgage to me, and that to the Insurance Office. I wish you would. 
</p><p>
Give my Love to Mrs. Montgomery and all enquiring 
Friends. Mrs. Stevenson and Polly Hewson and Sally 
Franklin present their Love, the latter adds her Duty. She 
is about to be married to a Farmer's Son. I shall miss her, 
as she is nimble-footed and willing to run of Errands and wait 
upon me, and has been very serviceable to me for some 
Years, so that I have not kept a Man. 
</p><p>
I am ever my dear Debby, your affectionate Husband, 
</p><p>
B. F. 
</p><p>
P. S. Have just opened the Apples and Cranberries, 
which I find in good order, all sound. Thanks for your kind 
Care in sending them.
