Dear. Peter, 
</p><p>
It is said that the manufacturing company at Mamaroneck have applied to the Legislature for an act to empower 
them (on paying damages) to overflow and drown as much 
of the adjacent farms, and without the consent of the owners, as may be necessary to make a pond that will afford a 
more ample supply of water than they can otherwise obtain 
there. The country abounds in plentiful streams. Why 
did they not fix on one that would answer their purpose ? 
</p><p>
When a piece of ground is wanted for a use important 
to the State, I know that the State has a right to take it 
from the owner, on paying the full value of it ; but certainly 
the Legislature has no right to compel a freeholder to part 
with his land to any of his fellow-citizens, nor to deprive 
him of the use of it, in order to accommodate one or more 
of his neighbours in the prosecution of their particular trade 
or business. Such an act. by violating the rights of property, would be a most dangerous precedent. 
</p><p>
The injury which the pond would doubtless cause to the 
health of the neighbourhood deserves attention ; but interesting as it is, I think it of less importance than that of 
exposing, by such an act, the rights of property to invasion 
and disturbance. It may be said that the pond, by facilitating manufactures, will be productive of good to the 
public ; but will it not produce more loss than gain, if any 
of the essential rights of freemen are to be sunk in it. 
</p><p>
If the company want any thing belonging to their neighbours, let them, like all other individuals, obtain it by voluntary, and not by compelled purchase. It would be strange 
if the Legislature appointed to guard our equal rights, 
should be prevailed upon to furnish means for such compulsion. 
</p><p>
These remarks are made on the supposition that what 1 
have heard may possibly be true ; but to me it appears so 
extraordinary, that I am inclined to suspect that it has not 
been fully and fairly represented. Be so good as to inform 
me, what the application made by the company to the Legislature really is. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Peter, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate uncle, 
</p><p>
John J a v.
