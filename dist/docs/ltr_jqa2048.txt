TO JOHN JAY

THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, December 2, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1794">1794</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
On my return here at the close of the last week from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> I received your favor of the 24th ultimo, and 
request you to accept my thanks for the communications 
it contains. By public report I had already heard not only 
that the treaty was signed, but the pretended purport of 
many articles of its contents. I had already felt myself 
obliged to leave ardent and in some instances inquisitive 
curiosity in the same suspense in which I had found it upon 
this subject. Upon the state of the negotiation when I left 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> I could give our friends here no other information 
than what resulted from public report in that place from 
which all I had collected was that the affair was in a probable 
train of settlement. Since the receipt of your letter I have taken the liberty to mention the stipulation which you observe requires not to be kept secret. 
</p><p>
The desire of peace among all the friends and supporters 
of the government in this country is animated to the highest 
degree by the prevailing opinion of an irresistible necessity. 
The task of essentially contributing to reconcile opposing 
interests to preserve dignity from humiliation and to harmonize discordant circumstances is in the public opinion 
once more assigned to the same person who in that opinion 
has recently performed it with so much ability. The hopes 
which have been indulged in this particular are at this moment however restrained by the general idea that an allied 
government is irrevocably determined upon the experiment of another campaign. 
</p><p>
I have been informed since my return from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> 
that Mr. Voltravers is gone to England. He made similar 
application to that mentioned in your letter to me for which 
he assigned the same reason. I told him that such an appointment from me would certainly afford him no protection in England, and even if it could, a compliance with his 
request on my part was inconsistent with my ideas of propriety. 
</p><p>
I received this day from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> a Baltimore news 
paper of 3Oth September. It contains no intelligence of 
consequence. 
</p><p>
The armies in this country do not at present appear to be 
very active. The Duke of York is here. There appears to 
be some difficulty about the reception of British troops into 
the cities. It is said the magistracy of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> have 
taken a resolution against the measure as it respects that 
capital. 
</p><p>
I am with every sentiment of respect and attachment, 
Dear Sir, your very humble and obedient servant.
