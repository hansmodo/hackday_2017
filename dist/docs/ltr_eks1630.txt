</p><p>
I hardly know how to commence a description of 
the events of the last three days. My brain is whirling 
from the long continued excitement and my body sore 
with bruises and fatigue but I will try to get into 
my usual humdrum style and record things as they 
happened. On the nineteenth we still lay near San Antonio. In the morning a force composed of Twigg s 
and Pillow's divisions was ordered far to the right on 
the San Angel road. Quitman held San Augustine 
and we kept the enemy in check at San Antonio. Our 
battalion strengthened by two companies from the 
Sixth, under Captain Hoffman, and two from the 
Eighth, under Brevet Major Montgomery, went far 
to the right reconnoitring. We passed over the same 
route as on the eighteenth but took no pains to con 
ceal our march among the lava crags and ravines as 
before, but showed ourselves to the enemy wishing 
them to believe we still threatened their position at 
San Antonio. About twelve the enemy s guns at 
Contreras, or San Magdalene, opened fire upon Twigg s 
and Pillow's advancing column. They were about 
four miles from us over the rugged ground we occupied 
and were ascending the side of the mountain. The 
firing soon became tremendous every flash and 
every peal was plainly perceptible to us, where we lay 
in reach of the guns of San Antonio. Soon the crash 
of small arms mingled with the incessant roar of ar 
tillery, the firing continuing for hours without our 
being able to perceive that our forces gained an inch. 
About five we, the light battalion, retired to our 
position on the San Antonio road. As the night closed 
in dark and rainy the firing ceased at Contreras and 
we in the camp of the first division were under in 
tense excitement to know the result of the battle. 
Our wagons were packed and we all stood in the muddy 
road without fires or food, miserably fatigued and 
uncomfortable, but intensely anxious to hear from 
the battle. Most of us finally settled down in the 
mud and rain, convinced that as we heard nothing 
we were not defeated. I was too anxious about my 
brother and companions to sleep. It was midnight 
before we heard. I then learned that the firing was 
mostly from the enemy that our operations were 
entirely for position that two officers, Captain 
Hanson of the Seventh and Lieutenant J. P. Johnston, 
second artillery, had been killed and our old friend 
Callender badly wounded in both legs, he commanded a battery of mountain howitzers, that the 
ground was broken, utterly impracticable for cavalry 
or field artillery, and that at daybreak the enemy s 
fortifications were to be assaulted by our infantry. 
Early on the morning of the twentieth, the attack 
was made and the works carried at the point of the 
bayonet, scarcely a gun being fired. We took fifteen 
hundred prisoners and twenty-two pieces of artillery 
among which were the guns captured by Santa Anna 
at Buena Vista. As soon as the result was known to 
General Worth, the Second Brigade of his division 
with our battalion were put in motion to endeavor 
to turn the position at San Antonio. For two hours 
we ran over the rocks moving by a flank, the enemy in 
a heavy column marching parallel to us and almost in 
gun shot, until the head of the Fifth Infantry pierced 
their line and the fight began at a quarter before 
twelve. It will be entirely impossible for me to give 
any lucid description of this terrible battle. It extended over a large space and I could see but little of 
it, being too hotly engaged to notice much beyond the 
sphere of my own duties. The point where our troops 
pierced the retreating column of the enemy was on 
the road from San Antonio to Mexico near a hacienda 
where the left of their line of defences terminated. 
Our battalion when the firing began must have been 
near a half mile to the rear. The " double quick " 
was sounded and the whole advanced at a run. We 
soon reached the road and turned in hot pursuit. This 
road is a broad, stone causeway with corn fields and 
pastures on each side of it, divided by broad ditches 
filled with water from three to six feet deep, the 
corn tall and very thick. It was soon seen as we rushed 
along the road that the enemy were only retreating 
to a fortified position which constituted their second 
line of defences at Churubusco. You will hear this 
called San Pablo and by another name which I can 
not recall. 
</p><p>
Along the road to this point I had seen no wounded 
or dead American, though on either hand and in the 
road were many dead Mexicans. I saw one colonel 
lying in the ditch shot through the heart. We had 
advanced on the road less than a mile when we were 
ordered into the fields to assault the right of the 
enemy s position, I am speaking of our battalion. 
We soon formed line in an open field behind the 
thick corn in our advance. The escopet balls were 
whistling over our heads, though at long range, and 
occasionally a cannon ball sang through the corn as it 
tore its path along in our front. 
</p><p>
At this time the battle was fiercely contested on 
our left and front, but I did not, and do not now know 
what regiments were engaged. It must have been 
about half-past twelve. Immediately in front of us, 
at perhaps five hundred yards, the roll of the Mexican 
fire exceeded anything I have ever heard. The din 
was most horrible, the roar of cannon and musketry, 
the screams of the wounded, the awful cry of terrified 
horses and mules, and the yells of the fierce combatants 
all combined in a sound as hellish as can be conceived. 
We had not from our battalion as yet fired a gun, 
but now rapidly advanced, all apparently eager to 
bring the contest to a hand to hand combat in which 
we knew our superiority. 
</p><p>
We could not tell what was before us whether 
the enemy were in regular forts, behind breast 
works, or delivering their fire from the cover afforded by the hedges and ditches which bordered the 
road and fields, all was hidden by the tall corn. 
</p><p>
We soon came out of it into a crossroad near some 
small houses, where we were exposed to a dreadful 
cross fire, which could scarcely be resisted. Many 
had fallen and the battalion was much scattered and 
broken. The grape round shot and musketry were 
sweeping over the ground in a storm which strewed 
it with the dead and dying. I found it extremely difficult to make the men stand or form, but finally suc 
ceeded with my own company which was at once 
ordered to charge under my brave Lieutenant Farrelly. 
I was occupied reorganizing the three other companies, 
the colonel and many of the officers and men not 
appearing when arose the most fearful time of the 
battle. My men were just formed and I had ordered 
the charge which I was about to lead, when the dread 
ful cry came from the left and rear that we were repulsed. A rush of men and officers in a panic followed, 
running over and again breaking my little command. 
I, however, succeeded in disentangling them from the 
mass, composed of a great portion of the Eighth, 
Sixth, and Fifth Infantry, with some artillery. I 
shouted that we were not repulsed to charge - 
and the day would be ours. Our colonel, C. F. Smith, 
now joined us, and the cry throughout was: " For 
ward!" 
</p><p>
Up to this time we were not aware that the other 
divisions of the army were engaged, but we now 
learned that Twiggs and others were pressing them 
on the left and had been fighting them an hour or 
more. Before this we had discovered we were under 
the fire of two forts, one a bastion front tete du pont 
flanking, and being flanked by a larger work, built 
round an extensive convent. Now as the whole army 
shouted and rushed to the assault, the enemy gave 
way, retreating as best they could to Mexico. They 
were pursued by all, hundreds being shot down in the 
retreat, our Dragoons charging after them to the guns 
at the gate of the city, where they were stayed by a 
tremendous discharge from the battery covering the 
entrance. Three officers, Captains Kearney and 
McReynolds and Lieutenant Graham, were here 
wounded, and Major Mills of the Fifteenth Infantry 
killed. 
</p><p>
As soon as the battle terminated and the pursuit 
ceased, I went back, tired and sore as I was, to collect 
the dead and dying of our battalion and did not return until night. The field presented an awful spec 
tacle the dead and the wounded were thickly 
sprinkled over the ground the mangled bodies 
of the artillery horses and mules actually blocking up 
the road and filling the ditches. How sickening was 
the sight after all the excitement of the contest was 
past! In my own company I found two dead and 
fifteen wounded. Lieutenant Farrelly received two 
shots, one in the breast and one in the arm. In the 
battalion there was in the aggregate fifty killed and 
wounded out of about two hundred and twenty engaged; in our entire division, three hundred and 
thirty-six; in the whole army, one thousand fifty-two. 
Seventy-four officers were killed and wounded, thirteen 
killed on the field. Our own particular friends are unhurt. I thank God for my escape which I now think 
wonderful. I was in the thickest of the fight for more 
than an hour, and my feet by grape and cannon were 
twice knocked from under me. 
</p><p>
The loss of the enemy must be immense. We have 
taken between two and three thousand prisoners, 
seven generals, and thirty-seven large guns. Their 
officers say, in killed, missing, and captured, they 
have lost over five thousand. They acknowledge 
that they had twenty, some say thirty thousand, in 
the fight. It was a wonderful victory and undoubtedly 
the greatest battle our country has ever fought, and I 
hope will bring peace. At all events, the great city 
is at our mercy, and we could enter it at any hour. 
</p><p>
On the morning of the twenty-first I was ordered 
to take charge of some funeral parties collecting and 
burying the dead. This was a sad, a solemn service - 
though in our haste we performed no burial rites 
paid no honors but laid our dead in the earth in 
the bloody garments in which they died, most of them 
on the spot where they fell. Indeed many were so 
torn and mangled by the shot it was entirely impossible to move them. In searching the ground for bodies 
I gained a very accurate knowledge of the field or I 
could not have made the rude sketch above. [He refers 
to a little map of the field which he had drawn.] In 
it I pretend to no accuracy except so far as the various 
points lie with regard to each other. At the convent, 
around which one fortification is constructed, I saw 
the Mexican prisoners and some fifty of our deserters 
who were taken in arms against us. The Mexican 
position was exceedingly strong and I can hardly 
understand how we carried it when I reflect that we 
had only between six and seven thousand engaged 
and they, at the least, estimate twenty thousand. 
</p><p>
I returned to camp about twelve and found every 
thing in preparation for a march as we all supposed 
to attack the city but we moved off to the left to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tacubaya" rel="city">TACUBAYA</a>, where we found <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> s head 
quarters, and learned that a flag of truce had been 
received from Santa Anna preparatory to negotiations 
for peace, and that we were not to enter the city. 
There was much muttering and grumbling throughout 
the army when it was known that these were to be 
the fruits of all our fatigue and fighting. I supped 
with Uncle Edmund and slept in a monk s cell in an 
old convent. 
</p><p>
On the twenty-third and twenty-fourth of August 
negotiations were going on, and finally on the twenty- 
fifth an armistice was concluded for the purpose of 
making a peace. By the armistice we are excluded 
from the city and either general can terminate it by 
giving forty-eight hours notice. This I fear may be 
the result, though perhaps Santa Anna may be compelled to make a peace to save himself from his own 
countrymen who will certainly kill him if deserted by 
his troops, as he surely will be if we fight again. The 
money which he will receive from us may enable him 
to declare himself dictator and maintain a force with 
which he can defy all the Pronunciamentos in Mexico. 
</p><p>
My notes have been written in detached portions, 
having been constantly interrupted by duty and a 
thousand annoyances, and I am fully aware that the 
preceding pages, although they may interest you, are 
an exceedingly lame and imperfect account of our 
operations. It is now the twenty-eighth of August 
and I have as yet seen none of the official reports; 
however, for your gratification I can tell you that I 
am favorably mentioned in the report, as Uncle Ed 
mund tells me, and that I have been spoken of in 
high terms at headquarters. He says I will now get 
the brevet which I earned long ago. This, of course, 
is for you alone. I have not much hope of so desirable 
a result as I have no political influence to aid me and 
would not resort to it if I had. My glorious brother, 
I learn, has a paragraph especially dedicated to his 
praise in Plymp ton s report. He fully deserves any 
thing complimentary which can be said of him. 
</p><p>
Commissioners were appointed on the twenty-sixth 
by Santa Anna, who met Mr. N. P. Trist on the eve 
ning of the twenty-seventh. Mr. Trist was accompanied by Major A. Van Buren whom, I presume, 
acted as his secretary. I am afraid Trist " has more 
cloth cut out than he can make up in his shop," but 
sincerely hope he may effect a treaty. At headquarters 
the utmost confidence is felt as to the result. They 
met last evening when the basis of the proposed treaty 
was submitted by Mr. Trist. They have met again 
today at some village a few miles from here. May 
God prosper and speed their consultations ! 
</p><p>
On the twenty-sixth our wagons were sent to the 
city for supplies, money, subsistence, etc. but 
were sent back from the gate, though the armistice 
declares there shall be no obstruction to our procuring 
supplies from the Capital. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a>, of course, 
was much astonished and immediately ordered a 
termination to the truce, but an apology came from 
Santa Anna almost before the words had passed his 
lips. Yesterday they went again, conducted by a 
quarter-master in citizen s dress; and escorted by 
Mexican lancers, they reached the main plaza with 
out any annoyance, but in moving from that place 
to some point beyond, they were attacked by the 
mob, stones and sticks being used. Several of the 
teamsters were wounded and the whole train driven 
from the city in double-quick time. Two wagons were 
lost in spite of the Mexican officers and soldiers who, 
it is said, did all in their power to protect our men and 
wagons even it is said killing some of the mob. 
Many of the Mexican women were engaged in this 
row which was undoubtedly an attempt at a revolution, the cry being heard throughout the crowd: 
" Death to Santa Anna! Death to the Yankees !" This 
ridiculous affair has again come near to terminate the 
negotiations, but I am told it is now adjusted and 
whatever we require is to be sent from the city to us. 
</p><p>
We are in a strange situation a conquering army 
on a hill overlooking an enemy s Capital, which is 
perfectly at our mercy, yet not permitted to enter it, 
and compelled to submit to all manner of insults from 
its corrupt inhabitants. I am much afraid that peace 
cannot be made, but this satisfaction remains to us, 
that the world must see that, though always victorious, we have ever extended the olive branch, always 
ready to sheathe the sword. 
</p><p>
I passed an exceedingly interesting hour this morning with Colonel Hitchcock in listening to the transla 
tions of many letters from a large mail coming from 
the Capital, which was captured on the twenty-second. 
They were from generals, aids, husbands, wives, sweet 
hearts, indeed, all classes. Many of them were written 
in a most beautiful style, all in a tone of utter heart 
broken despondency. Several stated that the troops 
opposed to us amounted to thirty-two thousand, that 
they were utterly routed and dispirited, and no longer 
able to oppose us. Some of them are admirable and 
accurate descriptions of the battles, evidently written 
by accomplished soldiers who well understand the 
subject. I recollect an expression in one written by 
an officer of high rank. Speaking of the assault at 
Contreras, he says: " When the rain and darkness 
came on at night I supposed the Americans would 
retire to sleep, but they were too astute to rest. In 
war the Yankees know no rest no fear." High 
compliments from an enemy. The letter is addressed 
to a Congressional deputy and calls upon him to come 
" to the funeral obsequies of his dishonored nation." 
In another the writer says: " All is lost, God has for 
saken us, the sentence of Belshazzar is written upon 
our walls, Mene, Mene tekel upharsin. They will 
all be published if Colonel Hitchcock ever succeeds in 
getting them to the United States. . . . 
</p><p>
This town, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tacubaya" rel="city">TACUBAYA</a>, is finely situated on the side 
and crest of a rugged hill, exceedingly irregular. At 
the highest point is a fine palace, now <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> s 
headquarters. The whole town is an incongruous 
mixture of palaces, luxurious gardens, ruins, hovels, 
and squalid poverty. The most exquisitely beautiful spot I have ever visited is a small garden of a 
wealthy merchant here. In its centre is a fountain 
throwing up its crystal jet high in the air, overhung 
by a magnificent cedar far surpassing any tree of the 
kind I have ever seen, at least three feet in diameter 
at the base, and its straight, smooth shaft in all the 
symmetry of an architectural column rising full forty 
feet without a limb. All round are the fruits, flowers, 
and vines of every clime growing luxuriantly in this 
eternal spring. At the extremity of the centre walk 
is a huge white ash full equal to the green monarch in 
the middle of this paradise. Growing side by side, 
their branches commingling, are apples, pears, quinces, 
figs, oranges, pomegranates, peaches, grapes, and other 
fruits, all growing in the space of half an acre of ground, 
all bearing all in the most flourishing health. 
Beneath, bordering some of the winding walks, are 
beds of strawberries, the ripe fruit looking most 
tempting. 
</p><p>
To the north, less than a mile from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tacubaya" rel="city">TACUBAYA</a>, lies 
Chapultepec, anciently the country residence of 
the Montezumas the cannon and troops on the 
walls plainly visible, while the palace around which 
the fortifications are built appears across the deep 
valley between us, as if a leap would place us in its 
marble halls. To the northeast, apparently at but a 
little greater distance, lies amid its lakes and marshes 
the boasted city of the Aztecs, its spires and domes, 
its walls and aqueducts, all plainly visible. Look 
round over the rich, broad valley of Mexico. What a 
glorious scene lies before us! I am now standing in 
the lofty belfry of this old Franciscan Monastery. 
In the centre of the valley is the reedy lake of Chalco, 
its waters shining through the long lines of the arbor 
vitae, ash, cypress, and other trees which border the 
broad causeways that cross its bosom in various directions, while around it and around us rise on every 
side the white haciendas of the wealthy owners of the 
soil, looking like lordly castles and all appears fair, 
rich, happy, and most beautiful. Encircling all this 
rise the lofty mountains, a frame to this most glorious 
picture, the shining summit of old Popocatepetl form 
ing the gilded ball at the top! How deceitful! " Tis 
distance lends enchantment to the view." Let us 
descend and examine more closely. Alas, how decay 
and neglect are stamped on everything around ! The 
fields abandoned and uncultivated; the stone walls 
broken and scattered; the hedges torn, un trimmed, 
and in many places uprooted and gone for rods; the 
long aqueducts and vast stone reservoirs broken and 
dry, or filled with green, slimy, aquatic plants and all 
manner of reptiles; while the white, aristocratic- 
looking haciendas are in ruins and uninhabited, the 
monuments of a more prosperous age. Sad evidences 
that with the monarchy departed the glory, wealth, 
and happiness of this fair domain. 
</p><p>
September 1. We are remaining quietly in our po 
sition here at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=tacubaya" rel="city">TACUBAYA</a>, awaiting the result of the 
negotiations. Ex-President Herrara is the chief of the 
Mexican Commission, and none of the members are 
Santa Anna s political friends. This increases the 
chance of a favorable result, as it takes from Santa 
Anna some of the responsibility, compelling the 
friends of these commissioners to unite with them in 
whatever course they may pursue. At headquarters 
the utmost confidence is felt that a peace will be made, 
and it surely will be if the Mexican president has sufficient power to effect it. The only fear is that he 
may not be able to overcome all the factions which are 
and will be opposed to him. His sincerity is sufficiently demonstrated by the fact that he has sent us, 
and is still sending us, all the supplies we require from 
the city. Over five hundred thousand dollars has 
already been received and more is still to come. 
</p><p>
We have a rumor that a mail has arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=puebla" rel="city">PUEBLA</a>, 
if so, I shall soon receive some of your delightful 
letters, shall again hear from my children. I wish I 
could be certain you will hear from me, but we are 
tolerably confident the last letters we sent from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=puebla" rel="city">PUEBLA</a> 
were carried to Santa Anna instead of to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a>. 
</p><p>
September 2. Everything remains in statu quo to 
day. The commissioners are in session and so far 
as can be ascertained from the remarks of Mr. Trist 
and Major Van Buren last evening, after they had 
adjourned, everything is progressing favorably. We 
have many rumors from the Capital, but they are 
so contradictory and sometimes so absurd that I 
scarcely listen to them. We are, however, certain 
that Santa Anna has collected from his scattered 
forces a large army and it is said has now over twenty 
thousand under arms in the city, keeping up a show 
of preparation for the war, which, however, gives us 
not the least uneasiness as we are confident of our 
ability to whip them at any time. Moreover, there 
will be no necessity of an assault as they will never 
suffer the Capital to be bombarded. 
</p><p>
I have said little of the Fifth or of any other regiment in the fight as I have confined my statements 
to such occurrences as came under my immediate observation. Colonel Clarke was wounded slightly in 
the early part of the action, Mclntosh  succeeding 
to the command of the brigade and Martin Scott 
to that of the regiment. It was much broken and I 
am told never acted in a body after Scott took the 
command. There seems to be much ill feeling exist 
ing hardly a shadow of harmony left in the regiment. Ruggles claims much glory for his conduct 
and has made a report, which has gone to head 
quarters, in which he claims to have captured the 
first gun taken at Churubusco. It is said, and I 
believe with truth, that the cannon was a thirty-two- 
pounder, broken down, spiked, and abandoned in the 
road by the enemy, that it was not fired and had been 
passed by many of our troops before Ruggles came 
up to it! Such is glory! McPhail, who is Martin 
Scott s toady, is highly spoken of by him, but the 
prevailing opinion in the regiment is that he behaved 
badly. In truth, there is much discord, all are quarrel 
ing about the honors, and I am thankful that I am 
detached from the regiment and have nothing to do 
with their envious misunderstandings. I keep my 
own counsel and listen to all their complaints without 
comment. As far as I am myself concerned I have 
nothing to say. If justice is not done me in the official 
reports, I shall suffer in silence. I cannot blow my 
own trumpet. I judge from the remarks of all who 
speak to me on the subject that I shall not be over 
looked. It is said the generals, too, utterly disagree 
in their reports, each claiming for their own commands 
the deeds done by other troops. How <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> 
can sift the truth from the whole mass of discrepancies 
I cannot conceive, indeed, I am induced to believe 
from what I have already heard that much injustice 
will be done by his report. Hints of its contents are 
constantly leaking out. With regard to one person 
there is no disagreement; all unite in the opinion that 
our chaplain, McCarty, deserves a wreath. He was 
under fire during the battle, pressing forward among 
the combatants, encouraging and exhorting all to 
deeds of gallantry, and it has been proposed that he 
be made a Brevet Bishop! 
</p><p>
I do not yet see any prospect of a safe mail to Vera 
Cruz, and I shall not send this until I am perfectly 
satisfied that it will not be captured, for rude as these 
memoranda are, they will interest you, and be a valu 
able reference for me in the future. Lieutenant Dent, 
on my application, has been today temporarily as 
signed to my company, and will have the military 
command of it for the present. Sergeants Updegraff 
and Archer have both been recommended for commissions. Updegraff will make a good officer and is 
a gentleman. The other I did not recommend, though 
he is a brave, honest man. Little Barney is quite 
sick, so I lose my cook, laundress, and servant, my 
" Caleb Quotem." I do not know what I shall do 
without him. By the bye, he desires that his respects 
be presented to " my lady," with assurances that 
there is plenty of " mustard " and that he will take 
care of the " captain." The market here is bad and 
everything horribly dear. ... It has cost me one 
dollar a day for provisions since my arrival. We hear 
that everything is quite cheap in the city but the mar 
ket men are all in a combination to cheat the Yankees, 
and our generals do not establish any market tariff as 
we all think they ought so we are compelled to submit 
or starve. 
</p><p>
September 7. Since the second, until yesterday, 
nothing occurred worthy of note, though I thought 
there were abundant signs that Santa Anna was only 
" humbugging " us, indeed, as my journal shows, I 
have thought from the beginning that it was only a 
scheme on his part to keep us out of the city and to 
gain time. It truly seemed wonderful to me that in 
the truce the immediate surrender of Chapultepec, 
Mexicalingo, and El Penon was not demanded it 
could not have been refused; the city itself must at 
once have given up ; they could not for some days after 
the battle of the twentieth have made any resistance. 
</p><p>
On the fifth it began to be rumored that the proffers 
made by Mr. Trist were rejected and the treaty vio 
lated; in fact, a week before that time I reported 
in writing to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a>, as I thought on sufficient 
evidence, that the enemy were violating the armistice 
by erecting and increasing their fortifications. But 
the general pronounced my informant, who was a resident of the city, a " liar." On the evening of the sixth, 
however, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> declared the truce terminated 
in consequence of the frequent violations of its articles 
by Santa Anna. We are now no more advanced than 
we were previous to the battle of the twentieth last. 
In the sixteen days during which he has been flattering 
us with the hopes of peace he has been actively collecting his scattered forces, and with all his energies 
preparing to renew the combat. He has now twenty- 
two thousand men under arms and the Capital placed 
in such a state of defence that the enemy loudly boasts 
we cannot take it. Fatal credulity! How awful are 
its consequences to us ! By it, the fruits of our glorious and incomparable victory are entirely thrown 
away. In the sixteen days our provisions and forage 
have been almost entirely exhausted; eight hundred 
of our men are sick, which added to about the same 
number put hors de combat by death and wounds 
leaves us nearly two thousand weaker than we were 
on the morning of the twentieth ultimo, and now, 
alas, we have all our fighting to do over again. 
</p><p>
In my opinion a much bloodier battle is to be fought 
than any which have preceded it. When will our 
rulers learn wisdom! How many times must they 
be gulled and deceived before they will learn to treat 
all Mexican promises with scorn! This morning a 
heavy column of the enemy were seen marching from 
the city by Chapultepec. Their right was established 
at a large building, said to be a foundry, something 
more than a mile from Chapultepec, and their left 
resting on that strong fortification. Their line is 
along an aqueduct and a deep ditch covered by bushes 
and trees bordering an extensive pasture and grain 
field an extremely strong position. 
</p><p>
I have just learned that the plan of attack is 
arranged. A forlorn hope of five hundred men commanded by Major G. Wright is to carry the foundry 
and blow it up. At the same time an attack from our 
artillery, the rest of the first division and Cadwalader s Brigade is to be made upon their line and 
Chapultepec, our battalion forming the reserve. This 
operation is to commence at three in the morning.
