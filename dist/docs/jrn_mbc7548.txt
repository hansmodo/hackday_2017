Mr. Hayne said his wife moaned over the hardness of the chaperones seats at St. Andrew's Hall at 
a Cecilia Ball. She was hopelessly deposited on one for hours. "And the walls are harder, my dear. What are your 
feelings to those of the poor old fellows leaning there, with their beautiful young wives waltzing as if they could never 
tire and in the arms of every man in the room. Watch their haggard, weary faces, the old boys, you know. At 
church I had to move my pew. The lovely Laura was too much for my boys. They all made eyes at her, and nudged 
each other and quarreled so, for she gave them glance for glance. Wink, blink, and snicker as they would, she liked 
it. I say, my dear, the old husbands have not exactly a bed of roses; their wives twirling in the arms of young 
men, they hugging the wall.

While we were at supper at the Haynes's, Wigfall was sent for to address a crowd before the Mills House piazza. 
Like James Fitz James when he visits Glen Alpin again, it is to be in the saddle, etc. So let Washington beware. 
We were sad that we could not hear the speaking. But the supper was a consolation pate de foie gras salad, biscuit 
glace and champagne frappe.

A ship was fired into yesterday, and went back to sea. Is that the first shot? How can one settle down to any 
thing ; one's heart is in one's mouth all the time. Any moment the cannon may open on us, the fleet come in.
