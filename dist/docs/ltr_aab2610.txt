I am much gratified, my dear sir, by your letter and notes. It is impossible for us to communicate freely, except through the intervention of counsel. I recommend to you to employ Mr. Randolph and Mr. Botts, and that you write a line to each of them this morning. They 
will not expect money, at least at present, and when I shall be discharged, I shall be able to furnish it. Write 
also to your friend Emmett, to come on forthwith. My trial is essentially yours; it will settle principles which 
will govern in both. The political character of Mr. Emmett will give him weight ; and it is greatly to be desired 
that a man of discernment and impartiality should witness the mode of these prosecutions and the extraordinary efforts and extraordinary means used to produce conviction, right or wrong.
