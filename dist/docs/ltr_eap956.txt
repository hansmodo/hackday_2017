Most Adored <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>:--I received your very welcome letter a few days ago and was perfectly delighted to hear from you. It was only 38 days from the day it was written till I received it. You say you will be home before cold weather. The sooner the better. It seems selfish in me, but I cannot advise you to stay. I want you to come home. Please, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>, do not put it off longer. Begin to settle up your affairs soon, for it will take a long time to get ready to leave a place where you have been three years.

Mr. Prizer and Miss Cope were married by the Rev. Cookman. They had quite a large wedding. Mother and Father were there. As Sarah Prizer and I are not good friends, of course I was not invited to the wedding. They sent me a card to call on them, but if it were not that Mr. Prizer had been such a kind friend to me and I respect him so much, I would never go to see them. I have not seen Mr. Prizer since he was married. He has been quite afflicted since, with the inflammatory rheumatism, and has been compelled to remain away from the office.

There could be no objections to my fixing a day for our wedding, but I don't think it's worth while. I will endeavor to be through with my sewing against you come home, and then we can set whatever time you think will be suitable. We can soon decide that matter.

Our Theodore says the moon is in the right quarter for marriages. Report says he is going to be married to Miss Hunter, but we don't believe it, for he spends too many evenings at home and keeps too good hours. He is always home before ten.

The contractors of the direct railroad from here to Philadelphia calculate having it in running order in twenty-three months. The depot is to be back of us, in Market Street.

Spring will soon be here, and I hope pleasant weather. Take good care of yourself, dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ech" rel="me">Enos</a>, and write when you can.
</p><p>
Most sincerely and devotedly,
</p><p>
