MY DEAREST HUSBAND, Peter returned safe with your dear letter, and 
cheered me with a favorable account of the prospects of your getting home in the 
stage. I was sorry you could not ride further in our carriage, as it might have spared you fatigue. 
</p><p>
In my dreams of last night, I saw you in your chamber, unable to move, from 
riding so far and so fast. I pray that an early letter from you may chase away the 
painful impression of this vision. I am still improving, and shall observe strictly 
what you say on the subject of the doctor's precepts. 
</p><p>
October 28. I have this moment received the letters you inclosed from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>. I rejoice to hear you are there, 
and shall await the next post with impatience ; by that, you will speak of yourself. The Marquis and Marchioness came 
to see me yesterday, with many other friends. I am getting well as fast as I 
can, for I have the reward in view of then seeing my beloved. Tell me if Mrs. Randolph is expected, and all the news you 
shall have time and patience to give me. I have written you every day since we 
parted, but am so shut up that I can say nothing to amuse ; when I begin to drive 
out, I hope to become a more interesting correspondent. Did you see the Bishop, 
or engage a place at school for Payne ? Farewell, until to-morrow, my best friend ; 
think of thy wife, who thinks and dreams of thee.
