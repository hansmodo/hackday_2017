My dear Brother, 
</p><p>
We have heard (though not from you) that a number of 
armed robbers have paid you a visit, and taken from the 
family their money, plate, &c. ; it is also said that they 
behaved towards our father, Peter, and Nancy, with more 
decency and respect than people of that class generally 
observe. I am very sensible of the distress which this 
misfortune must have occasioned ; my having, however, in 
two of my former letters, which I hope have arrived safe, 
desired you to draw upon me for one hundred pounds sterling, in two sets of bills of fifty pounds each, gives me 
much consolation ; should this not be adequate to your exigences, you may draw upon me for thirty pounds sterling 
more. While I have any thing, a share of it shall be 
appropriated to the wants of the family. I thank God that 
by means of economy, I shall be able to afford them some 
assistance from time to time, and in some measure mitigate 
the calamities brought upon them by the war, and the transmutation of their gold into paper. 
</p><p>
On the 25th of June last, Mr. Harrison, at Cadiz, shipped 
at my request, and on my account and risk, by the Black 
Prince, Captain John Robertson, bound from thence for 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, one bale marked I. Jay, to be delivered to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Robert Morris</a>, and containing 67 f Spanish yards of 
coarse cloth, and 70 1 yards of baize for lining. 
</p><p>
If this arrives safe, it will help to keep your servants 
warm next winter. A Spanish yard is somewhat less than 
an English one. Miss Katy Livingston writes me, that 
one little parcel of salt I sent you, was then safe in <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Morris</a>'s custody, and that she had by letter informed you 
of it. I have since sent another parcel of a dozen or fifteen bushels. I think you would do well to write to <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Morris</a> now and then, and enclose to him such of your 
letters for me as you may intend to go by vessels from 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
On considering the state of the family, I am really at a 
loss to see how the number of it can be considerably 
reduced. As to the old servants, who have expended 
their strength and youth for the family, they ought and 
must be taken good care of, while we have the means 
of doing it; common justice, and I may say gratitude, demands it. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole I believe it will be best, considering the 
age, infirmities, and various afflictions of our good old 
lather, not to press him upon these, nor indeed any other 
points that may not be very important, but by leaving his 
mind as much as possible undisturbed, and endeavouring 
daily to soothe and quirt his cares, to render the evening of 
his days as calm and composed as the complication of perplexities which surround him will permit. 
</p><p>
I am told Peggy behaved like a Roman matron, and in 
her conduct towards the robbers showed great firmness 
and presence of mind. Present to her my commendations 
on the occasion. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself that my father's fortitude did not forsake him, and therefore, that though he lost money, he did not 
lose health by those rude visiters. Your letter made me happy by assuring me that his strength continued as when 
I left him. God grant that I may find it the same on my return. I really regret Nancy's ill-health ; it should be 
better if my prayers and wishes could avail. You must endeavour to keep up each others spirits, and oppose misfortunes with manly firmness and cheerful resignation. 
</p><p>
We are all well. Remember us affectionately to all the 
family. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Frederick, 
</p><p>
Your very affectionate brother, 
</p><p>
