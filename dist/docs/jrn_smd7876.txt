Still no prospect of a lodging; so here we remain. I never before lived in a house without a balcony, 
and have only now found out how inconvenient it is. The whole establishment consists of two rooms on 
each side of a passage as wide as the front door ; and as it has a very low ceiling* with no opening, and no 
shade near, it is decidedly the warmest spot I ever inhabited. We all sleep on the floor and keep our 
clothes in our trunks except Lilly, who has an armoir without doors. Knives and forks for dinner 
to-day, though the table still consists of a single plank. The house really has a suffocating effect on 
me, there is such a close look about it. The front is fully a foot below the level of the street, while quite 
a flight of steps leads from the back door to the yard. In fact, the whole town consists of abrupt little 
mounds. It is rather a pretty place; but Heaven save me from the misery of living in it! Miriam is 
crazy to remain even advocates that dirty, bare, shutterless boarding-house where we passed the 
first night, from what attraction I cannot imagine. I am just as anxious to get into the country. I would 
hate the dull round of this little place ; I prefer solitude where I can do as I please without being 
observed. Here we are as well known by people we never before heard of as though we were fellow-citizens.
