                To Gen. William E.  Strong, in Chicago:

FARMINGTON AVENUE, HARTFORD.<br/>
Oct. 28, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1879">1879</a>.

GEN. WM. E. STRONG, CH'M,<br/>
     AND GENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE:
</p><p>
I have been hoping during several weeks that it might be my good fortune
to receive an invitation to be present on that great occasion in Chicago;
but now that my desire is accomplished my business matters have so shaped
themselves as to bar me from being so far from home in the first half of
November.  It is with supreme regret that I lost this chance, for I have
not had a thorough stirring up for some years, and I judged that if I
could be in the banqueting hall and see and hear the veterans of the Army
of the Tennessee at the moment that their old commander entered the room,
or rose in his place to speak, my system would get the kind of upheaval
it needs. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant's</a> progress across the continent is of the
marvelous nature of the returning Napoleon's progress from Grenoble to
Paris; and as the crowning spectacle in the one case was the meeting with
the Old Guard, so, likewise, the crowning spectacle in the other will be
our great captain's meeting with his Old Guard--and that is the very
climax which I wanted to witness.
</p><p>
Besides, I wanted to see the General again, any way, and renew the
acquaintance.  He would remember me, because I was the person who did not
ask him for an office.  However, I consume your time, and also wander
from the point--which is, to thank you for the courtesy of your
invitation, and yield up my seat at the table to some other guest who may
possibly grace it better, but will certainly not appreciate its
privileges more, than I should.
</p><p>
                              With great respect,<br/>
                                   I am, Gentlemen,<br/>
                              Very truly yours,<br/>
                                        S. L. CLEMENS.
</p><p>
Private:--I beg to apologize for my delay, gentlemen, but the card of
invitation went to Elmira, N. Y. and hence has only just now reached me.

     agreeing to speak, as the committee had requested.  Certainly there
     was something picturesque in the idea of the Missouri private who
     had been chased for a rainy fortnight through the swamps of Ralls
     County being selected now to join in welcome to his ancient enemy.]</i>
