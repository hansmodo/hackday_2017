Mr DEAR SIR: By the last mail I had the pleasure of receiving a letter 
from you. If I understand your letter, you appear to think a public expression of my opinion on the approaching election to be proper. I cannot 
think a measure of this nature necessary or proper. In other words, it appears to me highly improper, and could hardly fail to stamp the charge of 
intolerable arrogance upon me in indelible characters. But few men can 
ever expect to arrive at that height that would justify a step of that kind, 
much less an individual who lives in the most absolute retirement, and who 
has no ambition to emerge from it. I am perfectly reconciled to my situation, and would not willingly exchange it with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>. But my 
opinions upon the next presidential election are generally known. When 
Mr. Van Buren and Mr. Cambreleng made me a visit last April, I authorized them upon every proper occasion to make those opinions known. 
The vote of the State of Georgia will, as certainly as that of Tennessee, begiven to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a>, in opposition to Mr. Adams. The only difficulty 
that this State has upon that subject, is that, if Jackson should be elected, Calhoun will come into power. I confess I am not apprehensive of such a result. For writes to me, " Jackson ought to know, and, if 
he does not, he shall know, that, at the Calhoun caucus in Columbia, the 
term "Military Chieftain" was bandied about more flippantly than by H. Clay, and that the family friends of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> were most active in giving 
it currency;" and I know personally that Mr. Calhoun favored <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> 
pretensions until Mr. Clay declared for him. He well knew that Clay 
would not have declared for Adams, without it was well understood that he, 
Calhoun, was to be put down if Adams's influence could effect it. If he was 
not friendly to his election, why did he suffer his paper to be purchased up 
by Adams's printer, without making some stipulation in favor of Jackson? 
If you can ascertain that Calhoun will not be benefitted. by Jackson's election, 
you will do him a benefit by communicating the information to me. Make 
what use you please of this letter, and show it to whom you please.

I am, dear Sir, your friend 
</p><p>
And most obedient servant,
