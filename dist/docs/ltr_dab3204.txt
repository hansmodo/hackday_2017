DEAR GENERAL,
</p><p>
I have put off the assembling of the militia until 
the 4th of next month, to endeavour to procure a 
sufficient quantity of provision for them. But I fear it will not be in my power, as <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, who 
presides at the Board of Inspection, has ordered the 
Commissaries to stop purchasing ; and the Mingoes, in 
sundry parties, have been discovered on their march 
toward the inhabitants. Several persons have lately 
been killed and wounded in Westmoreland county, 
which will probably prevent my receiving any aid 
from the militia of that county. They have hired 
sixty men, who are now stationed upon their frontier. 
A Delaware Indian informed me this day, that two 
parties of warriors had just crossed the Ohio River, 
near Logstown and Chartier's Creek, which will, probably, by alarming and driving the inhabitants, prevent my getting the men from the other counties as 
I expected. The remaining Continentals are the cullings of our troops, and I cannot promise any thing 
clever from them. 
</p><p>
I have wrote to the artillery officer to hurry up 
the artillery and stores ; but I hear he is badly furnished with carriages and forage, which must prevent 
his marching with expedition. 
</p><p>
I think it is probable that the enemy are meditating an attack upon some of our posts, which, for 
want of sufficient garrisons and supplies, cannot make 
much resistance. I am preparing to receive them 
here, but the detachments to Fort Mclntosh, Holliday's Cave, Fort Henry, and Fort Armstrong, leave 
but a small garrison to defend this post. The Dela 
ware Indians continue their professions of friendship, 
and some of their warriors are now out with my 
scouts. But, as I have little or nothing to give them 
but good words and fair promises, I apprehend they 
will soon decline the service. I have the honor to be, with the highest sentiments of respect and esteem. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
