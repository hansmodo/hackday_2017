My Dear Sir:  I am very much obliged to you for your kind letter of
the 22d ult.  So many articles formerly belonging to me are scattered
over the country that I fear I have not time to devote to their
recovery.  I know no one in Buffalo whom I could ask to reclaim the
Bible in question.  If the lady who has it will use it, as I hope she
will, she will herself seek to restore it to the rightful owner.  I
will, therefore, leave the decision of the question to her and her
conscience.  I have read with great pleasure the poem you sent me,
and thank you sincerely for your interest in my behalf.  With great
respect,
</p><p>
                       Your obedient servant,
