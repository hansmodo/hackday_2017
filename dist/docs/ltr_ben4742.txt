I GREATLY approve the epithet which you give, in your 
letter of the 8th of June, to the new method of treating the 
small-pox, which you call the tonic or bracing method; I 
will take occasion from it to mention a practice to which I 
have accustomed myself. You know the cold bath has long 
been in vogue here as a tonic ; but the shock of the cold water 
has always appeared to me, generally speaking, as too 
violent, and I have found it much more agreeable to my 
constitution to bathe in another element, I mean cold air. 
With this view I rise almost every morning, and sit in my 
chamber without any clothes whatever, half an hour or an 
hour, according to the season, either reading or writing. 
This practice is not in the least painful, but, on the contrary, 
agreeable ; and, if I return to bed afterwards, before I dress 
myself, as sometimes happens, I make a supplement to my 
night's rest of one or two hours of the most pleasing sleep 
that can be imagined. I find no ill consequences whatever 
resulting from it, and that at least it does not injure my 
health, if it does not in fact contribute much to its preservation. I shall therefore call it for the future a footing or 
tonic bath. B. FRANKLIN.
