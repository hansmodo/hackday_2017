Mr DEAR SIR: Your letter of the 16th was received by Sunday's mail, 
together with its enclosure. I recollect having conversed with you at the 
time and place, and upon the subject, in that enclosure stated, but I have not 
a, distinct recollection of What I said to you, but I am certain there is 
error in your statement of that conversation to Mr. . I recollect distinctly what passed in the cabinet meeting, referred to in your letter to Mr. . 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun's</a> proposition in the cabinet was, that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a> should 
be punished in some form, or reprehended in some form; I am not positively 
certain which. As Mr. Calhoun did not propose to arrest General Jackson, 
I feel confident that I could not have made use of that word in my relation 
to you of the circumstances which transpired in the cabinet, as I have no 
recollection of ever having designedly misstated any transaction in my life, 
and most sincerely believe I never did. My apology for having disclosed, 
what passed in a cabinet meeting is this: In the summer after that meeting, 
an extract of a letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a> was published in a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a> paper, 
in which it was stated that I had proposed to arrest General Jackson, but 
that he was triumphantly defended by Mr. Calhoun and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>. This 
letter, I always believed, was written by Mr. Calhoun, or by his directions. 
It had the desired effect <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a> became extremely inimical to 
me, and friendly to Mr. Calhoun. In stating the arguments of Mr. Adams 
to induce <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Monroe</a> to support General Jackson's conduct throughout, 
adverting vo Mr. Monroe's apparent admission, that if a young officer had 
acted so he might be safely punished, Mr. Adams said, that if General Jackson 
had acted so, that if he was a subaltern officer, shooting was too good for 
him. This, however, was said with a view of driving Mr. Monroe to an 
unlimited support of what General Jackson had done, and not with an unfriendly view to the General. Indeed, my own views on the subject had 
undergone a material change after the cabinet had been convened. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> made some allusion to a letter the General had written to the 
President, who had forgotten that he had received such a letter, but said, if 
he had received such an one, he could find it; and went directly to his cabi 
net, and brought the letter out. In it <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague met">General Jackson</a> approved of the de 
termination of the Government to break up Amelia island and Galveztown, 
and gave it also as his opinion that the Floridas ought to be taken by the 
United States. He added, it might be a delicate matter for the Executive 
to decide; but if the President approved of it, he had only to give a hint 
to some confidential member of Congress, say Johnny Ray, and he would 
do it, and take the responsibility of it on himself. I asked the President if the 
letter had been answered. He replied, no; for that he had no recollection of 
having received it. I then said that I had no doubt that General Jackson, 
in taking <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pensacola" rel="city">Pensacola</a>, believed he was doing what the Executive wished
After that letter was produced, unanswered, I should have opposed the infliction of punishment upon the General, who had considered the silence of 
the President as a tacit consent; yet it was after this letter was produced and 
read, that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Calhoun</a> made his proposition to the cabinet for pvmishing 
the General. You may show this letter to Mr. Calhoun, if you please. 
With the foregoing corrections of what passed in the cabinet, your account 
of it to Mr. is correct. Indeed, there is but one inaccuracy in it, and 
one omission. What I have written beyond them is a mere amplification 
of what passed in the cabinet. I do not know that I ever hinted at the letter 
of the General to the President; yet that letter had a most important bearing 
upon the deliberations of the cabinet, at least in my mind, and possibly in the minds of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a> and the President; but neither expressed any 
opinion upon the subject. It seems it had none upon the mind of Mr. Calhoun, for it made no change in his conduct.

And most obedient servant,
