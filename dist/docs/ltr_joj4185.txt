Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have chosen for this letter a subject that is more within 
your province than in mine. " Quisque sua arte peritus." 
</p><p>
The 29th verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st Corinthians 
is deemed to be an obscure one. I understand it in a sense 
which satisfies me, but I find that the few commentators 
whom I have consulted, understand it in other senses. I 
will subjoin the verse, and explain what I conceive to be 
the meaning of it, in a short paraphrase. Tell me what 
you think of it. When you see Mr. Evarts, be pleased to 
present my best compliments to him. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your faithful and obedient servant, 
</p><p>

1 Cor. xv. 29. — " Else what shall they do who have been 
baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all 1 why are 
they then baptized for the dead ?" 
</p><p>
The apostle doubtless intended to include in this verse, 
an argument to support the doctrine he was endeavouring 
to establish. That sense of it, therefore, is probably the 
true one, which gives the most strength and fitness to the 
argument. 
</p><p>
His meaning will perhaps be more perceptible, if certain 
parts of the verse be transposed, as follows : 
</p><p>
Else what shall they do, who, if the dead rise not at all, 
have been baptized for the dead. Why are they then baptized for the dead 1 
</p><p>
As thus read, the converse of the proposition is plainly 
this, viz. That they are not baptized for the dead, if the 
dead are to rise : but that they are baptized for the dead, 
if the dead are not to rise. 
</p><p>
So that the question, whether they are baptized for the 
dead or not, depends on the answer to the question, whether 
the dead are to rise or not. 
</p><p>
PARAPHRASE. 
</p><p>
But Christ is risen, and he will certainly raise our dead 
bodies from the grave. If it were not so, what are believers, 
who, in a confident hope and expectation, and as an assurance 
of a resurrection, have been baptized, and thereby become 
professed disciples and followers of Christ, to do ? 
</p><p>
Baptism initiated them into his covenant and promise to 
revive and reunite their bodies with their souls after death, 
and bless them with everlasting life and happiness in & future 
state. If there is to be no such revival, no such reunion, 
no such future state, their baptism, and faith, and hopes in 
the gospel are vain and nugatory. What are they to do ? 
What can they do ? 
</p><p>
They who were baptized into Christ were baptized into 
his death ; they were buried with him by baptism into death ; 
they were planted together into the likeness of his death. 
And why ? Certainly for assurance that they should also 
be planted into the likeness of his resurrection. Divest 
baptism of its reference to a resurrection, and it will have 
no other remaining reference but the one to death and the 
dead. 
</p><p>
//"the dead rise not at all (as some among you say), then, 
and in that case, and on that supposition, all without exception who have been baptized, are in fact baptized for the 
dead, that is, for their own dead bodies, for their dust and 
ashes; for that is the only future state in which they will 
be and remain for ever. Why, or for what reason, or for 
what purpose then, or in that case, arc they baptized for 
their dead bodies — dead and never to rise again ? What 
effect can baptism, or promises, or covenants operate on, or 
for them, after they have passed into a state of utter and 
never-ending insensibility ? Is it for such a future state, 
that our bodies are baptized with water, and our souls with 
the Holy Ghost ? 
</p><p>
You know that I preach and declare to the Jews, and to 
the gentiles, that Christ is risen, and that he will raise the 
dead. Unless I was sincere in this, would I persist in 
preaching it at the risk of my life every hour ? 
</p><p>
If the dead are never to rise, what advantage or reward 
can I expect or receive, for the persecutions and sufferings 
which I willingly incur and endure, on account of my 
avowed and zealous adherence to Christ ? Did I believe 
that this was the only world in which I am to exist, would 
I not endeavour to find and enjoy all the good and all the 
gratifications which this world affords I It is natural for 
those who neither expect good nor evil beyond the grave, 
to say, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die." 
Nothing can be more manifest than that, if in this world 
only we have hope in Christ, we, his persecuted apostles 
and followers, are of all men most miserable. 
</p><p>
Be not deceived into doubts of a resurrection. You 
were not baptized for eternal sleep, but for endless life after 
death, and your baptism is a pledge to assure you of it. If 
you reject one of the assurances, or declarations, or promises 
of Christ as fallacious, how are you to rely on the rest ? 
Listen not to such teachers, lest their evil examples and 
communications seduce you into opinions and practices 
repugnant to the principles, institutions, and manners which 
are established and enjoined by the gospel.
