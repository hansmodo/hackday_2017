<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, October 23, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1794">1794</a>. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
On the 5th instant in the evening, twenty-eight days 
after our departure from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, we arrived in this place, 
and I now write you from our old station at Osborne's 
Hotel, in the Adclphi. 
</p><p>
We landed at Deal and came up from thence by land. 
The dispatches which had been delivered to me for Mr. Jay, 
and which were my principal inducement for coming hye, 
were so bulky that they could not be contained in a trunk 
which I could bring with me in the post chaise, and there 
fore I had the trunk that held them lashed on before, so as to 
have it immediately under my eyes. It was about seven in 
the evening, and of course quite dark, when we reached 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> Bridge. About a quarter of a mile on the other side 
of it, I thought I heard something fall, and instantly upon looking forward found the trunk, together with another 
which had been put with it, were both gone. My brother 
instantly alighted and fortunately found the trunk of papers 
directly under the carriage, the other was a few yards be 
hind, under the horses hoofs of another carriage which fol 
lowed us. We secured both in the chaise with us until we 
reached the house where we stopped, and upon coming to a 
light found that the ropes and leather straps which had 
held the trunks had all been cut away. 
</p><p>
I was sufficiently aware how far the felonious ingenuity 
was carried on this ingenious town, and from the moment of 
my landing had felt a great weight of anxiety on my mind 
with respect to my papers. I kept, therefore, a watch as 
strict as possible over them, and yet I cannot but attribute 
it to an extraordinary degree of good fortune that in the 
noise and bustle of a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> street in the darkness of the 
night, I was enabled to save the trunk which had fallen from 
a carriage upon the full drive over the pavements, and which 
in half a minute more would have been irretrievably gone. 
</p><p>
After such an accident I could not possibly sleep with 
Mr. Jay's dispatches in my possession. I therefore de 
livered them to him myself the same evening. I found he 
had been two or three days confined to his chamber by 
rheumatic complaints, but he has now I think entirely re 
covered from them. 
</p><p>
He has fully communicated to me the state of his negotiation here, and has done me the honor to consult me with respect to the treaty now in discussion between him and the 
Ministry here. It has been brought so nearly to a termination that I presume it will within three months be laid be 
fore the Senate for consideration. The terms are such as 
will not suit many people in America, and yet the stipulations on our part appear to me to be no more than honor and 
honesty dictate, and the satisfaction to be made by them 
almost as much (setting aside the further delay as to the 
delivery of the posts, I should say quite as much) as we are 
fairly entitled to require. The national honor will be maintained, the national interest will suffer infinitely less than it 
would by the most successful war we could wage ; and is it 
in the heart of an American to derive an objection from the 
consideration that by this treaty the national justice will be 
fully complied with and performed? 
</p><p>
I have not supposed myself competent to form a proper 
judgment upon a subject of this magnitude without longer 
time and more extensive information than I have been able 
to command. When Mr. Jay, therefore, condescended to 
take my opinion, I told him that as to the whole project, I 
felt myself inadequate to the decision from my own mind, 
and I could but assent to the idea in which he and Mr. Pinckney concurred, that it was better than War. As to the 
several articles they were freely canvassed by those two 
gentlemen for three days, during which I was present at 
their interviews, and suggested such ideas as occurred to me 
upon the subject. My observations were made with the 
diffidence which naturally arose from my situation, and were 
treated with all the attention that I would expect or desire. 
</p><p>
Upon the first occasion on which, as the servant of my 
country, I have been called to think and to speak, I am desirous to give you a full account of the manner in which I 
have conducted. Young as I am and unused to the station 
in which I am placed, my only hope is that the indiscretions 
of my novitiate may be few and unimportant. The confidence reposed in me by Mr. Jay on this occasion has been 
flattering in the highest degree, and I hope he will have no 
occasion to regret it. His kindness and civilities to my brother and me since our arrival, have been fully correspondent to the friendship which has so long subsisted between 
him and you, and to the benevolence which I have always 
experienced from him. We are also indebted to Mr. Pinckney for every possible attention and civility since our 
arrival. He has lately had the misfortune of losing his lady. 
</p><p>
When I asked you before I left America what I should 
do, if upon my arrival in Europe I should find no States General and no Stadtholder, the circumstance was nearer to the 
eventual fact than I expected. The successes of the French 
armies in every quarter have exceeded all the powers of 
calculation ; they are in full possession at this moment of all 
Flanders and Brabant ; they are besieging Nimeguen and Maestricht and it is admitted on all hands that nothing 
remains but a general inundation to keep them out of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>. Against this measure there appears to be a formida 
ble opposition on the part of the people. The patriotic 
party are again emerging from the silence of despair, and 
one or two of the Provinces have already declared for negotiating a separate peace. 
</p><p>
At <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> a petition, said to be signed by nine thousand persons, was lately presented to the magistrates in session, against the admission of their allied troops into the 
city and against the inundation. Mr. Van Staphorst and Mr. Visscher were two of the three deputies from the 
people who presented the petition. It was delivered in defiance of a law against petitions in times of danger, and I am informed that Mr. Van Staphorst is imprisoned in 
consequence of this procedure. Troops of cavalry have been introduced into the city and parade the streets. Cannon are placed at the Stadthouse, and attended with lighted 
matches, and the Stadtholder has declared, that any man who shall discover the smallest sign of opposition to the regular authority shall be punished with instant death. 
</p><p>
In this convulsive situation between the army of an invading enemy and those of allies equally terrible, the people 
in the Province of Holland are at this moment placed. The 
crisis cannot possibly be of long duration. The Stadt 
holder has been invested by the States General with a dictatorial power. His measures probably will be to receive 
the army of the Duke of York into <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, and to lay 
the country under water. But the decided inclination of a 
great majority of the people being opposed to this step, it 
becomes a question whether it will be practicable and upon 
the issue of the question the fate of the Netherlands is suspended. 
</p><p>
The King of Prussia negotiates a separate peace ; Spain 
and Sardinia in all probability must do the same; and the 
Emperor is so thoroughly exhausted that he is almost 
wholly disabled from continuing the war with any vigor. 
At the opening of the campaign Britain and France, the 
Rome and Carthage of modern times, will perhaps remain 
alone to terminate the present contest. 
</p><p>
You have long before this heard of the catastrophe of Robespierre in France, and of the pretence upon which he 
suffered. Since that time a party styling themselves the 
Moderates have hitherto maintained their ascendency in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> and in the Convention. They all join in loading the 
memory of Robespierre with every possible execration, and 
have transferred to him the appellation of the Tyrant, which 
had before been appropriated to the late King. The horrible 
cruelty which has been so destructive at Lyons, in la Vendee, and in every part of the Republic ; the sinking of thousands 
of boat loads in the Loire ; the shooting of thousands by 
pairs at Lyons and elsewhere, the murdering of thousands 
under the forms of law by the guillotine, all is heaped upon 
Robespierre, with as much apparent detestation as every 
friend to humanity has really felt at these transactions. 
A system of moderation has been pursued by the present 
ruling party. Very few have suffered by the guillotine. 
The commissioners in the several Departments have con 
ducted themselves with lenity and endeavored to soothe 
and conciliate. Great numbers have been liberated from 
prison. The Convention has ordered that those remaining 
under arrest shall be immediately tried or discharged ; 
the disposition for mercy seems even extending to the 
wretched emigrants themselves, and though always excepted from the terms of capitulation granted to the several 
garrisons taken by the French troops, yet in one or two 
late instances they have not been put to immediate death. 
</p><p>
But the violent party are far from being crushed. In the 
Convention it still struggles, and by the Jacobins and most 
of the popular Societies it is still supported. A rupture 
between the Convention and the Jacobins has widened so 
much that it must before long come to a crisis. Such is 
the succession of anarchical factions which alternately 
bear sway in the center, while at the borders all the armies 
of the Republic, with a combination of order and enthusiasm, of severe discipline and irresistible impetuosity, 
pass from victory to victory, and have almost laid the whole 
alliance of their enemies prostrate at the feet of the Convention. 
</p><p>
Britain however yet retains every appearance of continued hostility, and although the most determined partisans of the ministry venture to sigh openly for peace, yet 
no man of any description appears to expect it. The war 
to every outward appearance is still popular, and the ad 
ministration since the Duke of Portland's admission to it 
is said to be strong beyond all former example. 
</p><p>
But the reins of government have been drawn so tight 
here that it would not be surprising if they should break. 
Thirteen persons arc to be tried for high treason the next 
week. You will probably see in some of the late papers 
the indictment upon which they have this day (October 25) 
been arraigned. The trials are expected to take up a month 
and there is much more agitation in the public mind upon 
the subject than appears. Loyalty at this moment is strong 
and yet it is in terror. Opposition gnashes its teeth, but 
is silent or joins in the general cry. Suspicion, jealousy 
and a want of mutual confidence, betray themselves in the 
conduct and conversation of every one. These things are 
not heard, they are not seen, they can only be felt. In short 
the present state of society in this land of freedom has al 
most every mark of a severe despotism. But it is certainly 
an unnatural state of temper to this people and it cannot 
continue long. A gentleman * conversing with me yesterday upon the approaching trials said, The treason is violently constructive, but it will do for this time. I expect 
the prisoners will be found guilty. Hampden was found 
guilty, so were Russell and Sidney, so was Sacheverell, but 
it was remembered afterwards" I have heard nothing like 
this said by any Englishman (the gentleman I speak of is 
an American), but I have seen many who I believe think as much or more. 
</p><p>
As to the war, excepting their naval successes they have 
only shared in the defeats of their allies, who are now all 
upon the point of leaving them. France will probably 
have the terms of peace with them all at her own disposal, 
and will then turn all her attention towards the sea. At 
this moment there is said to be a fleet of twenty-seven ships 
of the line at sea from Brest, about 100 leagues west of Scilly ; 
ninety frigates have been built since the beginning of this 
year. They have ten thousand British seamen now prisoners in France, and they will not exchange a man of them. 
The deficiency of men here for the navy is of course prodigious, and even the fleet under Lord Howe is not half 
manned. It is however just gone to sea again, and another action, as terrible as that on the first of June, may be fought before the close of the year. 
</p><p>
But for the future in this war every advantage seems to 
be on the side of France. Their numbers are inexhaustible, 
and the loss of ten thousand men has no other effect than 
that of calling out myriads more. Everything that can be 
the subject of human possession belongs to the nation, and 
this maxim is most thoroughly reduced to practice. Of 
every species of property and of human life their prodigality 
exceeds the bounds of imagination itself. They have no 
commerce to lose. They have a most inveterate animosity 
against this nation, and above all they have to establish 
upon the sea a reputation to bear a parallel with that of 
their armies upon the land. 
</p><p>
On the other hand the resources of Britain are comparatively small. They will not want money. There does not 
appear the smallest suspicion of a deficiency on that score, 
and it is everywhere agreed that at this moment the Minister might command it to any amount. But their want of seamen is without a remedy, and must increase greatly even 
by the most brilliant victories. Their commerce suffers 
severely, and the moment they lose their naval superiority 
must be annihilated. Strongly as they are bent upon the 
success of the war, and inveterate as they always are against 
the French, they have not that enthusiasm which in France 
has levelled all the boundaries of private property, and put 
the whole mass of physical force in the nation into the 
hands of the government. They contend with an enemy 
whom repeated defeats will not discourage, but who would 
be irresistible after a single victory. In short, Sir, the situation of this country, external and internal, appears to be perilous, and its prospects gloomy in the extreme. 
</p><p>
But I have already spun my letter to an immeasurable 
length, and will ask for no more of your time now except 
to assure you that I remain, with every sentiment of duty 
and affection, your son. 
</p><p>
P.S. Instead of thirteen persons to be tried for high 
treason I find upon further inquiry only nine; and instead 
of twenty-seven ships of the line now at sea from Brest, 
there are but fourteen. I had this last fact from an American 
captain who fell in with them.
