<p> Dearest JP
<p> How&#8217;s my new stationary? Pretty swanky or what? Take a good look for you won&#8217;t get any more on it- it&#8217;s going to be rationed for letters that aren&#8217;t airmail. 
<p> Got your letter today- and I must say you seem to have changed a lot for the better and I like! Lord only knows whether I have or not- don&#8217;t think so- but just so you won&#8217;t think too hard on me for that Cleveland change of mind- I want to say that they didn&#8217;t care if we went but would rather we stayed here. I would rather stay here so why go? I can take things too- in fact, I&#8217;m getting hard boiled I&#8217;m afraid. Someone I just met last night looked at me and said I was plenty hard- in fact hard as nails! Also, that I&#8217;d be mean as hell to any man that married me. It&#8217;s made me think a bit and it&#8217;s sure funny to hit the nail on the head right off. For I sure would be. I&#8217;ve always known it though- but never had any one tell me so! It may have been a line- and he was on his 4th day of being drunk so I don&#8217;t know. One of Graham&#8217;s friends.
<p> So I&#8217;m doing alright huh? What&#8217;s a matter? Fraid I&#8217;ll quit writing? Well, I won&#8217;t- not when I get as sweet letters as this anyway- and I certainly don&#8217;t expect them all to be up to a certain standard either. After all, mine sure aren&#8217;t and everyone has gripes once in a while if they are human so never fear.
<p> Oh, I&#8217;m sorry, I must apologize again for opening your Christmas present right away, am I forgiven? Really- I&#8217;ve had so many compliments on it for it is lovely and thanks again. By the way, please don&#8217;t get me something in place of the [unintelligible] after all it was my fault it got stolen and you shouldn&#8217;t feel that it should be replaced, Please don&#8217;t! Remember one time when I told you how I felt about so many gifts? Well, of course I have changed my opinion some but at the same time I wish you wouldn&#8217;t. Get yourself something instead. Has my package- rather yours- arrived yet? I just sent it by plain mail and thought I mailed it in plenty of time. Really isn&#8217;t much but you wouldn&#8217;t help me any and I don&#8217;t know what you have, so- !
<p> Had a wonderful dinner yesterday! Really was perfect but I ate too much and was very miserable afterward. We all were in fact. I&#8217;m sure dead for sleep. I&#8217;m not going to work tomorrow and am taking Monday off so I can clean stuff and junk and know where things are for a change.
<p> Pop sent me some money for Christmas and said it was from &#8220;Pop , Sandy, Spike and Spot!&#8221; the three dogs! Also said there were five new kittens- seems sort of late, wonder if even the animal kingdom feels the effects of the war! 
<p> That&#8217;s all for now
<p> Love from Ruth
