SIR,
</p><p>
The general has received yours, and directs me to inform you that such
assistance will be granted as is necessary for the protection of the
country and your honour.
</p><p>
He desires that no expedition be set on foot till you hear further
from him. He has no objections to Colonel Littlefield's remaining with
you till the arrival of more officers.
</p><p>
Handcuffs will be sent you as soon as they can be made. If you have a
number of prisoners at any time to send up, let them be fastened right
and left hands, and the guard cut the strings of their breeches, and
there will be no danger of their making their escape, as they will be
obliged to hold them up continually with one hand.
</p><p>
Last evening Josiah Fowler made his escape from the provost; possibly
he may fall into the hands of your scouts or patrols. If he does,
please to take the best care of him.
</p><p>
The general will write you fully by the captain who will soon
re-enforce you. One hundred pair of shoes will be sent you. The map of
the country is herewith transmitted, for the purpose of taking a
sketch of it. You will please to do it as soon as possible, and send
it up by a careful hand. The general does not wish you ever to carry
it from your quarters.
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rip" rel="met">Richard Platt</a>, Aid-de-camp.
