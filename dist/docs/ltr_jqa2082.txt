The object of the consular office is the benefit of merchants 
and mariners in countries other than their own ; it is to 
procure facilities and conveniences for them that this institution is appropriated. The legislature will therefore 
necessarily consult their feelings and opinions, and I am afraid that they would consider consular powers rather as a 
burden upon them than as an advantage to them. The spirit of commerce is averse to every species of restraint, 
and it would probably consider in that light every power of any utility that could be given to a consul.

An increase of emoluments would meet with the same opposition. The system of economy in all public expenses 
is in general carried further with us than an enlightened interest would advise, and a generous compensation will not 
readily be obtained for the services of an office, which in the minds of our countrymen is of questionable utility. 
</p><p>
The consular appointments of the government have in 
several instances been unpopular, but the difficulty of filling 
every place well would not disappear by an augmentation 
of powers or of compensation. It would even be increased 
in proportion to them, upon the natural principle that the 
character of the officer should be confidential in proportion 
to the magnitude of the trust. To make the office an object 
of acceptance to American citizens qualified to fill it well, 
must be made very expensive, for there are many European 
ports where there is a great commerce with the United States, 
and where no American citizen qualified for such a station 
resides. In all such places, if the principle that a consul 
must be a citizen is established, the office alone must be 
made an inducement for a respectable American citizen to 
leave his country, and every thing that is precious and valu 
able annexed to that name, in order to fill it, or there must 
be no consul at the place.

The misfortune in this case is that almost all the arguments that can apply to the subject are two edged swords, 
that may be used on both sides of the question : for instance 
all the examples of misconduct mentioned in your letter 
might be adduced as reasons for not augmenting the authority 
or profits of the office. Your argument stands thus : some 
of the consuls betray their trust ; therefore increase the importance of the office and appoint men who will not betray 
the trust. But the opposite arguments : some of the consuls betray their trust; you cannot get confidential men 
for the office without incurring a heavier expense than the public utility of their services in it will warrant ; therefore 
do not make the office more important. If the powers already given are abused, do not give others, the abuse 
of which would be more pernicious. If the trifling compensation now given is yet undeserved, be careful not to increase it. ...
