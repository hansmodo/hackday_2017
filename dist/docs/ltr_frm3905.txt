DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
I have got thus far in my return from the Southward. I have been 
within eight miles of Bacon Bridge, and have had a hard march for no 
purpose. The General imagined the enemy was coming out, and is 
still of the opinion they will take the field soon ; but I think they will 
not without a reinforcement, which it seems they expect, as they have 
don e for six months past. I hope the flag schooner is sailed; if so, 
discharge Capt. Howell's crew and cutter. Col. Moultrie is to stay in 
<a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, and collect his regiment; he will be of service to you at 
least, will not keep you so much confined. I shall send Col. Maham 
for the horses of your corps as soon as I hear from you. I intend to 
leave you thirteen, but they must not be the best. I will send you 
arms as soon as I get them from the high hills of Santee. 
I am, yours, &c., 
</p><p>
