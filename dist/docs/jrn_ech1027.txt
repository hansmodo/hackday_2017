We are having delightful weather, the sun shining warm and clear from time of rising to setting without a passing cloud to dim his brightness. Yesterday we spread out our blankets and dried them well and covered the floor of our tent with pine twigs to raise us off the ground and render our beds softer and more comfortable. I read several chapters in the Bible.

This morning while at breakfast, Mr. Cox came up and informed me that two men were at work upon my claim. This surprised me very much, as I had been working upon it only two days before, myself, and they had no authority as my tools were left upon the lot, thereby fully complying with the regulations which require persons holding claims to work upon them
every five days and leave some tool upon them as evidence to every one that they are occupied. I immediately went down to the claim, determined to bring the matter before the alcalde if I could not settle it without. I told the gentlemen, who were all the way "from down Maine" as they informed me, that the lot was claimed by myself and that I had worked upon it. They agreed to give up the lot but wanted pay for the work they had done upon it. This I was not disposed to do, but as they had saved me some labor I helped them to dig a ditch through their adjoining lot and thus the matter was settled.

I then sunk a hole about five feet square and about four and a half in depth on the bank of the stream, but at that depth the water came in and prevented me from going any deeper. I commenced another hole on the opposite side, which I intend to finish tomorrow, and if possible, to dig something out of it.

While at work I saw a number of native Californians slay an ox. It was done in this wise: They first rode after him until they succeeded in fastening the lasso upon one fore leg. When this was done he became very furious and rushed at the horse, to which the lasso was fastened, several times. He was then surrounded by several men with lassoes endeavoring to catch him over the head. After rushing furiously upon them a number of times and throwing one of them head over heels down the hill, two of them caught hold of his tail and by means of the horse pulling one way and the men in the opposite direction, they had him fast long enough for one of them to fasten a loop around both his hind legs, when they threw him down, tied him and cut his throat. As soon as they had it dressed I went over and purchased the head with the skin on it for $1.25.
