Well <a href="results.php?tla=rte" rel="spouse">Ruth</a> I don't know about the first hundred years (I should live so long) but I do
hope that the first year was the hardest. if it was then all will be well again before
too many moons have passed.<br><br>

Today i heard a radio broadcast from Sunnyvale from the <a href="http://sunnyvale.ca.gov/voices/Hendy/hendy.html">Hendy Iron Works</a> and from the way
they talked Sunnyvale is far from the place where you and I went to high school. By the way
how would you like to spend a couple of days in the old joint again? I suppose that Vern Hall
is still there and may have two or three good looking English teachers around by now.</p>
<p>
Oh yes your last letter was dated Nov 11 so that postman must be slipping again. Soon I hope
to be closer to my mail address and then mail will reach me without all this delay.</p>

When you go to Cleveland be very careful about suspicious characters as I understand that <a href="http://www.bobhope.com/bob.htm" rel="none">Bob Hope</a>
came from there and you know how tricky he is.<br><br>

Where to you expect to be on Xmas I wish that i could be with you but since I cannot save a thought
for me and i will do the same where ever I may be at that time. Write to me whenever you have time
and in time i will receive it and be happy.<br><br>

Love<br>
