TO GENERAL LANE.

EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,<br/>
July 17 <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1863">1863</a>.
</p><p>
HON. S. H. LANE.
</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR:--Governor Carney has not asked to [have] General Blunt
removed, or interfered with, in his military operations. He has
asked that he, the Governor, be allowed to commission officers for
troops raised in Kansas, as other governors of loyal States do; and I
think he is right in this.
</p><p>
He has asked that General Blunt shall not take persons charged with
civil crimes out of the hands of the courts and turn them over to
mobs to be hung; and I think he is right in this also. He has asked
that General Ewing's department be extended to include all Kansas;
and I have not determined whether this is right or not.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=abl" rel="me">A. LINCOLN.</a>
