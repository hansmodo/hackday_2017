I have at this moment perused with delight thy letter, my darling husband, with 
its inclosures. To find you love me, have my child safe, and that my mother is well, 
seems to comprise all my happiness. The doctor has ordered me some drops, which 
I take dutifully. I walk about the room, and hope a few days more will enable me 
to ride, so that you may expect me to fly to you as soon ah ! I wish I might say 
how soon. Madame Pichon writes me an affectionate letter, and begs me to accept 
a pair of ear-rings for her sake. You no doubt have them, as they are not with the 
letter. I am punctual in delivering to Betsey all your commands, and she insists 
on adding a postscript to this which I am not to see. I have also a letter from the 
President, asking me to procure several articles for Mrs. Randolph, which I shall 
soon be able to do, by driving to the shop doors. There have been many callers to 
day, and pressing invitations. It is now past nine o clock, and I cease to write, 
only to dream of thee. Tell Mrs. Thornton I am havjhg the model of a bonnet 
made for her; the new ones are just coming in. Write soon to thy devoted
