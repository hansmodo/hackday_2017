Society-Hall, General Morris's, 23d May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1780">1780</a>.

MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met friend colleague">AARON</a>,
</p><p>
My patience is almost exhausted. I have been waiting for you this
month past. Here I am, a pensioner upon the bounty of my good friend
General Morris, and am likely to continue so, unless you are kind
enough to come and carry me away. This is the fifth or sixth letter I
have written you on the subject. What can be the reason of the great
delay in forwarding letters by the post? Your last was above a
fortnight old before it got to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=princeton" rel="city">Princeton</a>; and, upon inquiry, Daddy
Plumb informs me the riders are ordered to ride forty miles a day
during the season. Must I attribute it to the fatality which has
already separated us, and, I fear, is determined to put an eternal bar
to our junction? Such an event would blast all my hopes of future
happiness. My dear Aaron, I want words to express my pleasure in
anticipating the satisfaction of retiring from the cares of the world
with you, and living in all the simple elegance of ancient
philosophers. We should make a rapid improvement in every branch of
useful literature; and when we came to act our parts on the theatre of
the world, we might excite admiration, and, what would be infinitely
more pleasing to us, we should be better men and better citizens.
</p><p>
After Mr. Stockton returned from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, I communicated to him
my situation and my intentions. He approved of my determination to go
away, and gave me some advice, which you shall know when you see me.
Thus I have left Mr. Stockton without causing the least uneasiness,
and I am now ready to enter upon our old plan, which appears the most
consistent with our present views. As I said in all my letters to you
on the subject, I am here from a principle of economy; but it is
disagreeable to stay so long as a visitor, and I am therefore obliged
to request you to alter your intention about coming here, and set off
the moment you receive this. I have no horse, and depend entirely upon
you. Besides the time we lose by postponing our settlement, I have a
matter of great importance to us both to communicate to you, that has
no connexion with our studying, and which makes it necessary for me to
see you immediately.
</p><p>
Poor Mr. Stockton is incurable. He cannot survive the summer.
</p><p>
Yours,
</p><p>
