I learn that a motion was made today in the Senate by Senator Yulee of Florida to expel the editor of the Union from the privileged seats in the Senate, inconsequence of the publication in his paper of a communication signed "Vindicator" censuring the Senate for their rejection of the Ten Regiment bill, and that it had given rise to an animating and exciting debate in the Senate, but was undecided at the adjournment of the Senate today.
