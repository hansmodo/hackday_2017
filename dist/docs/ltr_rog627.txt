My good and kind friend - You will I am sure be glad to know that all things prospered here according to my wishes I saw the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jed" rel="contact met">President</a> this morning and he affords me every facility and and in carrying out my mischief. I shall leave here on Tuesday or Wednesday. Tuesday certainly as the [illegible name of ship] upon which I will go will sail the latter part of the week on Friday from Wilmington to Bermuda. Once I shall take out as much cotton as I can. I shall be very much engaged for the
remainder of my sojourn here in geting ready. I sincerely wish you were here to aid me in some other matters. I know how selfish this wish must appear, when I know how your heart has ached to get to your dear family--you have been so kind to me that I feel as if your family were almost old friends. Pray make them like me for it will bring great pleasure when I return to know them.
</p><p>
I will write again when I leave here and also from Wilmington for I have the vanity to suppose that you will take an interest in my movements.
</p><p>
I cannot tell you my friend how highly I appreciate your friendship and offer you my heartfelt congratulations on being [illegible] and true enjoyment of this society [illegible] to you.
</p><p>
Believe me always your true friend
