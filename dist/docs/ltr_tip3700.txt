Sir, 
</p><p>
You will doubtless, ere this reaches you, have been 
informed that Congress have been pleased to appoint 
me Quartermaster-General. This was so totally unexpected, that it will take me some days yet, before 
I can get ready to proceed to camp. In the mean 
time, I shall make some necessary arrangements for 
conducting the business of the department in this 
State, and the other States southward of it. The 
gentlemen concerned in the department with the army, will, I hope, cheerfully continue to exercise the 
duties of their respective offices until my arrival in 
camp, which shall be as speedily as possible. I have 
the honor to be, with the greatest respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
