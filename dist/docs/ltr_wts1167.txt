HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,

Dear Brother : Ever since my return from my trip in 
Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas, I have been so busy that 
I have neglected to write to you. We are now most 
comfortable in our new house, and I am settling down 
into a kind of routine that looks like old banking times. 
I see a great many people, and get any quantity of letters 
with all sorts of invitations, but I decline all save a few 
here in the city. I think I will go to see Henry Sherman x at his commencement at Dartmouth next spring, 
and that will carry me to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, where I expect to be 
besieged. Strange to say, I receive more strong feeling 
of favor from that quarter than any other, spite the 
attempt made to put me in antagonism to their special 
hobbies. I shall not go near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> this year, nor 
take part in the reorganization of the new army until 
ordered to do so officially. I have the report for the 
Committee on the conduct of the war nearly done, and 
will send it by a staff-officer to Mr. Wade before the 
meeting of Congress. 
</p><p>
It will contain much detailed and original matter 
which has never seen the light, and will make the great 
campaigns as clear as possible, being composed wholly 
of letters which passed at the time between me and all 
the officers above and below me. It is more voluminous 
than I intended, and I will curtail it all I can, but as it 
is now it is very interesting, I will also acompany it 
with a map which is very valuable, and I want it engraved on metal. I know Congress will appropriate for 
proper maps, and not insult us with such lithographs as 
have heretofore been customary. I may have to get you 
to help me in this, as I have expended vast labor on this 
map and want it done right. 
</p><p>
I notice that foreigners are very anxious to see me, 
and all who come here come to call. I shall be here all 
winter, and if you want anything I can do it. I hope 
you are sure of your re-election. I have many inquiries 
as to your prospects, and cannot answer them. I think 
you have more influence and reputation out of Ohio than 
any man of the State. . . . You observe that Mr. Johnson is drifting toward my terms to Johnston. He cannot help it, for there is no other solution. Any plan will 
have objections, but that least of all. 
</p><p>
Affectionately, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wts" rel="me">W. T. SHERMAN</a>.
