Dear General, 
</p><p>
Since my last, one man was killed by the Indians 
near the mouth of Cross Creek. I suppose this hath 
been done by some of the enemy's spies. The country has taken the alarm, and several hundred men 
are now in arms upon the frontier. I hope to be 
able to repel the enemy. The Maryland corps was 
stationed at a post on the frontier of Westmoreland 
county, and have in a body deserted and crossed the 
mountains. Indeed, I am apprehensive the other 
corps will soon follow their example, if their sufferings are not speedily attended to. 
</p><p>
I have sent spies up the Alleghany, with orders to 
proceed to Presque Isle, and further, if it is practicable, to discover the enemy, should they actually 
be on that route, and, if possible, to bring me a 
prisoner. Things here are in the utmost confusion ; 
some officers confessing me to be the Commanding 
Officer, and others. Colonel Gibson ; nor is it likely 
they will alter until your Excellency's pleasure is 
expressed, I have the honor to be, with the most 
sincere attachment and respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
