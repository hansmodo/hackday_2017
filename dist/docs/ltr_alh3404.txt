</p><p>
I have been duly honoured by your several favours of the 
25th, 27th, and 30th of July. The misfortune at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, has produced a very disagreeable alteration in our affairs, and has thrown a gloom upon the favourable prospect 
which the campaign previous to that event afforded. But I 
am in great hopes, the ill consequences of it will not continue 
to operate long, and that the jealousies and alarms which so 
sudden and unexpected an accident has occasioned in the 
minds of the people both of your state and to the eastward, 
will shortly subside, and give way to the more rational dictates of self-preservation and regard to the common good. 
In fact, the worst effect of that disaster is, that it has served 
to create those distrusts and apprehensions ; for if the matter were coolly and dispassionately considered, there would 
be found nothing so formidable in <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Mr. Burgoyne</a>, and the 
force under him, with all his successes, as to countenance 
the least languor or despondency, and experience would 
show that a tolerable degree of vigour in the states more 
immediately interested, would be sufficient to check his 
career, and perhaps convert the advantages he has gained 
into his ruin. But while people continue to view what has 
happened through the medium of supineness or fear, there is 
no saying to what length an enterprising genius may push 
his good fortune. I have the fullest confidence that no endeavours of the council will be omitted to bring your state 
(with the distresses of which I am sensibly affected,) to every 
effort it is capable of making in its present mutilated condition, and they may rely upon it no means in my power will 
be unemployed to co-operate with them in repelling the danger that threatens the state, and through it the continent. 
If I do not give as essential aid as might be wished to the 
northern army, it is not from want of inclination, nor from 
being too little impressed with the importance of doing it. 
It would be the height of impolicy to weaken ourselves too 
much here, in order to increase our strength there, and it must 
certainly be more difficult, as well as of greater moment, to 
control the main army of the enemy, than an inferior, and, I 
may say, dependent one ; for it is pretty obvious, if General 
Howe can be completely kept at bay, and prevented effecting any capital purposes, the successes of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>, 
whatever they may be, must be partial and temporary. 
Nothing that I can do shall be wanting to rouse the eastern states, and excite them to those exertions which the exigency of our affairs so urgently demands. I lament that they 
have not yet done more, that so few of their militia have 
come into the field, and that those few have been so precipitate in returning home at this critical period ; but I have, 
nevertheless, great reliance upon those states. I know they 
are capable of powerful efforts, and that their attachment to 
the cause, notwithstanding they may be a little tardy, will not 
allow them long to withhold their aid, at a time when their 
own safety, and that of a sister state, and, in a great measure, 
the safety of the continent, calls for their greatest zeal and 
activity. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself the presence of <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague met'>General Lincoln</a> in the Northern Department will have a happy 
effect upon them. Those gentlemen possess much of their 
confidence, particularly the latter, than whom there is, perhaps, no man from the state of Massachusetts, who enjoys 
more universal esteem and popularity. And in addition to 
that, they are both to be considered as very valuable officers. 
You intimate a wish that some assistance could be drawn 
from the southern states at this time. But while things remain in their present posture, and appearances, however 
illusory they may prove in the issue, afford the strongest reason to keep their force at home, to counteract the seeming 
intentions of General Howe, I could neither ask nor expect 
them to detach succours to the northern states, who are so 
well able to defend themselves against the force they now 
have to oppose. 
</p><p>
I hope an exaggerated idea of the enemy's numbers may 
have no injurious influence on our measures. There is no 
circumstance I am acquainted with that induces me to believe <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> can have more than five or six 
thousand men; and if the force left in Canada is so considerable as the information you send me makes it, he cannot have even so many. The representations of prisoners 
and deserters in this respect are of little validity ; their 
knowledge is always very limited, and their intentions, particularly the former, very often bad. 
</p><p>
Beyond what regards their own companies, little or no 
attention is due to what they say ; the number of regiments your informant mentions corresponds with other 
accounts ; but the number of men in each company he 
gives the establishment, is not, I am persuaded, their actual 
state. The enemy's army in Canada last campaign, though 
they suffered little by action, must have decreased materially by sickness and other casualties ; and if the recruits 
to them, both from England and Germany bore any proportion to those which have reinforced General Howe, the 
state of their regiments must be greatly inferior to what 
your information holds forth.
</p><p>
The appointment of <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a> to the government 
of your state, is an event that, in itself, gives me great pleasure, and very much abates the regret I should otherwise 
feel for the loss of his services in the military line. That 
gentleman's character is such, as will make him peculiarly 
useful at the head of your affairs, in a situation so alarming 
and interesting as that which you now experience.
