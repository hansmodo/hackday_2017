My Dear Brother : . . . I hear you have gone on to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and therefore I must go off without seeing 
you. I have been off the line of communication since 
leaving <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a>, save a few hours at Bridgeport, during which I had hardly time to put my official signature 
to papers demanding my hand. I have made a report of 
our movements up to the return to Bridgeport and enclose 
it with this, a copy which I brought here, and which you 
may keep, only, of course, under the confidence of absolute secrecy until the War Department thinks proper to 
make the original public. . . . 
</p><p>
I suppose you will read this report, and I invite 
attention to the part referring to the assault on Tunnel 
Hill. I know that Grant in his report will dwell on 
this same part. I was provoked that Meigs, looking at 
us from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chattanooga" rel="city">Chattanooga</a>,. should report me repulsed, and that 
Mr. Stanton should publish his letter as semi-official. 
Meigs apologized to me for using Thomas's name instead 
of mine throughout, which he charged to a copyist, but 
made no amends for the repulse. The whole philosophy of the battle was that I should get, by a dash, a position on the extremity of the Missionary Kidge, from 
which the enemy would be forced to drive me, or allow 
his depot at Chickamauga station to be in danger. I 
expected Bragg to attack me at daylight, but he did not, 
and to bring matters to a crisis quickly, as time was 
precious, for the sake of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aeb" rel="colleague met">Burnside</a> in East Tennessee, 
Grant ordered me to assume the offensive. My report 
contains the rest. Again, after the battle, Granger was 
ordered to push for Knoxville, but his movements were 
so slow that Grant, impatient, called on me, and my 
move was the most rapid of the war and/perfectly successful. I could have gone on after/Longstreet, but 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aeb" rel="colleague met">Burnside</a> ranked me, and it was his business, not mine. 
So I reinforced him all he asked, ami returned.

The Fifteenth Corps, now Logan/s, and Dodge's division of the Sixteenth Corps are now at work on the railroad from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a> to Decatur, land from Decatur to 
Stevenson, thus making a triangle of railroad which it 
is estimated will relieve the great difficulty of supplies 
which has paralyzed the Army of the Cumberland. This 
will take five weeks. I leave my headquarters at Huntsville, and go in person down the Mississippi to strike 
some lateral blows, to punish the country for allowing 
guerillas to attack the boats. I go on Friday to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>, and thence to Cairo, where with Admiral Porter 
I will concert measures to produce the result. I expect 
to send one expedition up the Yazoo, and go myself with 
another up Eed Eiver, levying contributions to make 
good losses to boats, and punish for deaths and wounds 
inflicted. I think we can make people feel that they 
must actually prevent guerillas from carrying out their 
threats that though we have the river, it will do us no 
good. My address will be <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a>, for a month, and 
Huntsville after. We can hardly fashion out the next 
campaign, but it looks as though we should have to move 
from the Tennessee Eiver. I should prefer to take 
Mobile and the Alabama as well as the Chattahoochee, 
and move east from Montgomery and Columbus, Miss.

I wish you would introduce a bill in Congress increasing the number of cadets on this basis one from each 
congressional district per annum. In districts not represented, vest the appointments in the Secretary of War 
out of boys not over eighteen in the armies in the field, 
to be selected in any manner that may be prescribed by 
law, or by the regulation of the President. This would 
hold out to young fellows the prospect of getting a 
cadetship. Last summer we were called on to recommend candidates, and I was amazed to find so many 
worthy applicants. All who came forward for examination preferred <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=west point" rel="city">West Point</a> to a commission. The great 
want of the army is good subordinate officers. The army 
is a good school, but <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=west point" rel="city">West Point</a> is better. It is useless 
to deny that a special preliminary education is necessary 
to the military officers, and the cheapest school is now at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=west point" rel="city">West Point</a> and is susceptible of infinite increase. . . .

I think the President's proclamation unwise. Knowing the temper of the South, I know that it but protracts 
the war by seeming to court peace. It to them looks 
like weakness. I tell them that as they cool off, we 
warm to the work. That we are just getting ready for 
the war, and I know the effect is better than to coax 
them to come back into the Union. The organization 
of a Civil Government but complicates the game. All 
the Southern States will need a pure military Government for years after resistance has ceased. You have 
noticed the debate in Richmond, on the President's 
proclamation. That is a true exhibit of the feeling 
South. Don't fall into the error that the masses think 
differently. Of course property-holding classes South 
deplore the devastation that marks the progress of their 
own and our armies, but the South is no longer consulted. 
The Army of the Confederacy is the South, and they 
still hope to worry us out. The moment we relax, they 
gain strength and confidence. We must hammer away 
and show such resistance, such bottom that even that 
slender hope will fail them. 
</p><p>
I still am opposed to all bounties. The draft pure and 
simple, annual, to fill vacancies in the ranks. Pay of 
men in the front increased to even forty^ dollars a month, 
and that of men at depots and to the rear diminished to 
a bare maintenance if not less. /'Four hundred dollars 
bounty is an absurd commentary -y^here two-thirds draw 
bounty and remain absent from their rank and are discharged for disability without hearing a shot. Deal 
with the army as you would if you were hiring men for 
special work. Pay those who do the work high; those 
who are sick, unfortunate, or shirking, pay little or nothing. The same of officers from the major-generaL-to 
lieutenant. The President must make vacancies for the 
rising officers, the " creations " of the war. I am willing 
to quit if a younger and better man can be found for my 
place. . . .

Your affectionate brother,
