MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I received your kind letter by Captain Story, of November 
iQth, and a subsequent one by Captain Falconer without date. 
</p><p>
I have received also the Indian and buckwheat meal, that 
they brought from you, with the apples, cranberries, and nuts, 
for all which I thank you. They all prove good, and the 
apples were particularly welcome to me and my friends, as 
there happens to be scarce any of any kind in England this 
year. We are much obliged to the captains, who are so good 
as to bring these things for us, without charging any thing 
for their trouble. 
</p><p>
I am much concerned for my dear sister's loss of her daughter. It was kind in you to write a letter of condolence. I 
have also written to her on the occasion. I am not determined about bringing Sally over with me, but am obliged to 
you for the kind manner in which you speak of it, and possibly I may conclude to do it. I am sorry you had so much 
trouble with that Nelson. By what is now said of her here, 
she did not deserve the notice you took of her, or that any 
credit should be given to her stories. I am afraid she has 
made mischief in my family by her falsehoods. I think 
your advice good, not to help any one to servants. I shall 
never be concerned in such business again; I never was 
lucky in it. 
</p><p>
My love to all our relations and friends, and to Mr. and 
Mrs. Duffield, and to Mrs. Redman. I am much pleased 
with her daughter's writing, particularly for its correctness. 
I am now, and have been all this winter, in very good health, 
thanks to God. I only once felt a little admonition, as if a 
fit of the gout would attack me, but it did not. Whether 
sick or well, I am ever, my dear Debby, your affectionate 
husband, B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. I forgot to tell you that a certain very great lady, 
the best woman in England, was graciously pleased to accept 
some of your nuts, and to say they were excellent. This is 
to yourself only.
