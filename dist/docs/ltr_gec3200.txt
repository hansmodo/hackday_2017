DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I was not honored with the receipt of your Excellency's letter of the 3d instant, before Friday last. I 
am truly sensible that the security of the North 
River is a matter of the utmost importance to the 
United States in the present war, and that the safety 
of this State in a more particular manner depends 
upon it. It gives me real concern, therefore, that so 
little has been yet done to effect it. Works we laid 
out, and began, to defend the chevaux-de-frise, and 
something was done towards finishing and sinking 
such of them as were not completed when the enemy 
came up the river; and these are the only steps that 
have hitherto been taken. 
</p><p>
When the enemy left the river, it was my opinion 
that as many of the troops from the Northern Department should be sent to reenforce the Grand Army 
under your Excellency's more immediate command, as 
could be possibly spared ; that no greater number 
should be left in this quarter than what would be 
barely sufficient to cover the country, which is more 
immediately exposed to the ravages of the enemy ; to 
amuse them from sending large reinforcements to 
General Howe ; and to carry on the necessary works 
for the security of the river. One brigade of Continental troops, with the militia then in service, and 
such of this State as I should be able to call out, I 
conceived fully sufficient for the purposes. Two small 
New Hampshire militia regiments, which were sent 
down from the northward by <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, about 
seventy Connecticut militia, and those of Colonel Dubois's, who escaped from Fort Montgomery, and a 
regiment of militia of this State, were assigned for 
the works. The rest of the troops, consisting of 
General Warner's brigade of militia (which arrived 
earliest), General Parsons's brigade, and some Connecticut militia, were drawn off to King's Street and 
the adjacent neighbourhood on the Sound, under the 
immediate command of <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>. 
</p><p>
It was late before the militia from the northward 
arrived, and they were worn out with the fatigues of 
the campaign and their long march hither. The time 
for which they were engaged in the service expired 
the 1st of this month, and of those of this State the 
15th; and while they were with us, the want of tools 
and materials was such as to prevent their being employed to any degree of advantage. Dubois's regiment are the only troops on the spot at present, 
which are by no means sufficient to mount the necessary guards. Of course the works are entirely 
neglected. 
</p><p>
The resolutions of Congress, of the 5th of November, for regaining the forts and passes on Hudson's 
River, and securing the communication thereof, vested 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> with such ample powers for drawing 
supplies of men and materials from New Jersey, and 
the different States eastward, that something essential 
might yet have been done towards the completion of 
this important business before the opening of the 
spring, would he have taken upon himself the direction of it. But, as I understand that gentleman pro 
poses taking his seat at the Board of War, agreeably 
to his late appointment, those resolutions, as they apply to him particularly, will lose their intended effect ; 
and, though I learn by a letter I received from <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>, accompanying that from your Excellency, 
that he is directed to turn his views in future to this 
object, yet, however capable he may be for the task, 
I fear he will fall short in the execution of it, unless 
he shall be able to command the same aids, at least, 
which <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> was empowered to do. 
</p><p>
I am clearly of the opinion, that a strong fortress 
ought to be erected either on the opposite side of 
the creek from where Fort Montgomery stood, or 
at <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, opposite Port Constitution. The latter I prefer, as the most defensible ground, and be 
cause the navigation of the river there is more difficult and uncertain, and the river something narrower 
than it is at the former place. A new chain should 
be procured, if possible, and with the boom, which is 
nearly completed, stretched across the river. This, 
with a floating battery or two, and some gun-boats, 
I am persuaded, would answer the purpose effectually; 
and in this 6 pinion I am confirmed, as the enemy 
chose to risk every thing for the reduction of Fort 
Montgomery, rather than to attempt passing it with 
their shipping, while in our possession. If <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a> 
should be the place fixed upon, it might be of 
great advantage to erect a small strong work on the 
high point on the opposite shore, a little above Fort 
Constitution. 
</p><p>
As to the management in this department, of which 
your Excellency desires my sentiments, I am con 
strained to say (but I wish it may be considered as in 
confidence) we have either been very unfortunate, or 
it has not been as wise as might be wished. Prudent 
management of our small force, in my humble opinion, would have saved the forts, though, perhaps, 
with the far less important loss of the Continental 
Village. By losing the forts, the Village fell, of course. 
It is true a few stores were moved from thence, and 
saved, but I dare say not of equal value with those 
lost at the forts, exclusive of the shipping. Besides, 
had we held the forts, we should have commanded 
the navigation of the river, and drove the enemy to 
the necessity of attempting to relieve Burgoyne (for 
it is evident that this was their intention) by land, 
in which case it might have been in our power, by 
calling the militia to our assistance, to have destroyed 
Clinton's whole army. Indeed, without opposition they 
could not have effected a march in season for the in 
tended purpose, and I am confident they never would 
have attempted it. 
</p><p>
I never considered <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, or the Village, posts 
of great importance, only as they stood connected 
with the defens of the river ; for, without the latter, 
the enemy could, by landing above, come in the rear of the former, in which case they must fall, of course. 
The event has fully proved this. Notwithstanding, 
the chief part of this department were kept idle at 
<a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> and the Village, while the forts were left 
without a sufficient number of men to carry on and 
complete the works, or defend them. If the shipping had been properly manned, and this was often solicited,, the Congress, at least, might have been saved ; 
and even after the loss of the forts, by a prudent 
disposition of the force in this quarter, which was 
soon greatly increased by the coming in of the militia, <a href='/results.php?city=kingston' rel='city'>Kingston</a> might have been saved, and the greater 
part of the mischief, committed by the enemy along 
the shores of the river, prevented. 
</p><p>
A constant intercourse, which has been permitted 
between the country and city, by flags, has, I fear, 
been very injurious, as well by frequently enabling 
the enemy to learn our strength, as otherwise, without 
our being able to derive similar advantages from such 
correspondence. I have heard that there has been a 
weekly exchange of newspapers with Governor Tryon, 
and that the printers, Gaine and London, are permit 
ted the like liberty. The latter I have no doubt of. 
An over share of complaisance and indulgence to the 
disaffected, (which, though arising from principles of 
benevolence and humanity, will always create jea 
lousies and unfavorable suspicions, especially among 
the common people, and often even reach the army,) 
should, therefore, be carefully avoided. In these respects, I cannot help thinking there has been a want 
of common prudence. I have taken the liberty of 
hinting my sentiments of these matters to General 
Putnam, and I would fain hope that there may be 
more circumspection used in future. 
</p><p>
The Legislature of this State is to meet at this 
place on the 5th of next month. The variety of important business to be prepared for their consideration, and other affairs of government, will employ so 
great a part of my time, that I should not be able 
to give that attention to the works for the security 
of the river, as their importance, and the short time 
in which they ought to be completed, require. But 
you may rest assured, Sir, that every leisure hour shall be faithfully devoted to them, and my advice 
and assistance shall not, for any consideration, be 
withheld from the person who shall be intrusted with 
the chief direction of them. I have the honor to be, 
with the most sincere esteem and respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,
