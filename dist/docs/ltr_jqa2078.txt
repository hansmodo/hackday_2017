TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE

No. 44. [EDMUND RANDOLPH]

THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, June 25, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
... I have now the honor of inclosing the translation of 
the plan for the convocation of a National Convention, which 
has been sent by the States General to the several Provincial 
Assemblies for their consideration. The probability seems to 
be that it will eventually be adopted, but the deliberations 
will be more or less deferred in the different provinces, and a 
considerable time will elapse before it will be put in execution. 
</p><p>
The principal objection that I have heard against it is, that it interposes another provisional government between 
the present and that of a regular constitution, that it multiplies revolutions beyond the line of necessity, and seems to 
prescribe changes merely for the sake of changing. 
</p><p>
This is not however generally considered an objection of 
much weight, nor is the plan itself a subject of much discussion. It is indeed impossible to conceive a people more 
indifferent to everything relating to theories of government than the Batavians. I should hazard nothing in saying 
that the law calling for the gold and silver of the citizens has been the subject of more animadversions in every town 
of the Republic, than the plan herewith inclosed has been, 
or ever will be, throughout the whole territory. The plan 
itself may perhaps give an adequate idea of the people for 
whom it is formed. It is the result of three months labor 
and intelligence of a committee appointed for the purpose, 
and it is distinguishable less perhaps for any luminous 
principles than for a minuteness of detail, which does not disdain even the building of benches for the voters in the primary assemblies. . . . 
</p><p>
June 26. The affair of the municipality of Rotterdam has not hitherto had consequences so unpleasant as was
apprehended, the demonstration of mutual opposition has, indeed, more than once assumed an alarming appearance, 
but hitherto has produced no distressing events. The Provincial assembly annulled the order that had been 
extorted from the municipality, and discharged from their arrest the magistrates of the former Regency, excepting 
only the high officer Van Staveren, whose arrest is continued, and the irritation of the people of Rotterdam against him is 
given as the reason for the measure. They made at the 
same time a calm, rational and judicious address to the 
people who had made the irregular demands, recommending 
temper and moderation to them, and conjuring them not to 
disgrace the fair and unblemished character of the revolution 
by acts of violence, even against the most obnoxious characters. They proposed, however, to appoint a Committee 
to examine into the conduct as well relative to concerns of 
politics as of finance of all the former regents, in order that 
those who had been the oppressors of the people should be 
compelled to make indemnity from their private fortunes. 
These measures, however, were far from being satisfactory 
to the popular society at Rotterdam. The secretary of the 
irregular assembly formally protested against the decree of 
the Provincial Assembly, and published his protest in the 
newspaper. On the 22d instant the people assembled again 
in considerable numbers. But the French commandant of 
the place, in concert with the municipality, having publicly 
declared that he should use all the force under his command 
against any attempt whatever to disturb the peace, and 
every demonstration of a determination to defend the municipality at all hazards against any further indignity being made, they finally dispersed without attempting any violence. 
</p><p>
June 30. I have this day received from the Greffier of 
the States General a card which mentions that the secretary 
of the Ambassador Extraordinary from the Republic at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> has just arrived, with the ratification by the National 
Convention of the treaty of friendship and alliance, signed 
at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a> on the 15 of May last, and inclosing two copies 
of the treaty. I send one of them herewith. 
</p><p>
On the twenty-third of this month the commission of 
eleven appointed by the Convention to prepare and present 
for discussion the organic laws of the proposed French 
constitution, made their report to the assembly. They have 
abandoned without ceremony the constitution of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1793">1793</a>, and 
substituted in its stead much more similar to those forms of 
government which are familiar to Americans. The assembly 
are to open the discussion of the plan on the 4th of July. 
</p><p>
The legislative body is proposed to consist of two parts, a 
council of 500 and a council of Elders to the number of 250, to 
be renewed by halves every two years. A landed property 
of some kind is made a qualification of eligibility. The 
Council of 250 has only a negative upon the laws proposed 
by the more numerous body. 
</p><p>
The executive power is to consist of a directory of five 
members, one of whom is to be renewed annually, and which 
is to be presided by the members alternately each for three 
months at a time. The legislative and executive powers 
are both to be surrounded with forms of solemnity, and to be 
guarded by an armed force. These are the principal circum 
stances which discover the prevalence of theoretic opinions 
which have been unfavorably reviewed at certain periods of 
the Revolution. The report was made by Boissy d Anglas, a member who has been very much distinguished of late, and 
whose intrepidity on a recent critical occasion has given 
him an extraordinary degree of popularity. It was received with great applause by the audience in the galleries, 
and appears to be equally satisfactory to the public in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>. 
I have the honor to be, &c. 
</p><p>
