                       To W. D. Howells, in Boston:
</p><p>
                                                  ELMIRA, Oct. 9 '79.
                                                  </p><p>
MY DEAR HOWELLS,--Since my return, the mail facilities have enabled Orion
to keep me informed as to his intentions.  Twenty-eight days ago it was
his purpose to complete a work aimed at religion, the preface to which he
had already written.  Afterward he began to sell off his furniture, with
the idea of hurrying to Leadville and tackling silver-mining--threw up
his law den and took in his sign.  Then he wrote to Chicago and St. Louis
newspapers asking for a situation as "paragrapher"--enclosing a taste of
his quality in the shape of two stanzas of "humorous rhymes."  By a later
mail on the same day he applied to New York and Hartford insurance
companies for copying to do.
</p><p>
However, it would take too long to detail all his projects.  They
comprise a removal to south-west Missouri; application for a reporter's
berth on a Keokuk paper; application for a compositor's berth on a St.
Louis paper; a re-hanging of his attorney's sign, "though it only creaks
and catches no flies;" but last night's letter informs me that he has
retackled the religious question, hired a distant den to write in,
applied to my mother for $50 to re-buy his furniture, which has advanced
in value since the sale--purposes buying $25 worth of books necessary to
his labors which he had previously been borrowing, and his first chapter
is already on its way to me for my decision as to whether it has enough
ungodliness in it or not.  Poor Orion!
</p><p>
Your letter struck me while I was meditating a project to beguile you,
and John Hay and Joe Twichell, into a descent upon Chicago which I dream
of making, to witness the re-union of the great Commanders of the Western
Army Corps on the 9th of next month.  My sluggish soul needs a fierce
upstirring, and if it would not get it when <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant</a> enters the meeting
place I must doubtless "lay" for the final resurrection.  Can you and Hay
go?  At the same time, confound it, I doubt if I can go myself, for this
book isn't done yet.  But I would give a heap to be there.  I mean to
heave some holiness into the Hartford primaries when I go back; and if
there was a solitary office in the land which majestic ignorance and
incapacity, coupled with purity of heart, could fill, I would run for it.
This naturally reminds me of Bret Harte--but let him pass.
</p><p>
We propose to leave here for New York Oct. 21, reaching Hartford 24th or
25th.  If, upon reflection, you Howellses find, you can stop over here on
your way, I wish you would do it, and telegraph me.  Getting pretty
hungry to see you.  I had an idea that this was your shortest way home,
but like as not my geography is crippled again--it usually is.
</p><p>
                                             Yrs ever
                                             </p><p>
                                                       MARK.

     <i>[Editor's note: The "Reunion of the Great Commanders," mentioned in the foregoing,
     was a welcome to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> after his journey around the world.
     Grant's trip had been one continuous ovation--a triumphal march.
     In '79 most of his old commanders were still alive, and they had
     planned to assemble in Chicago to do him honor.  A Presidential year
     was coming on, but if there was anything political in the project
     there were no surface indications.  Mark Twain, once a Confederate
     soldier, had long since been completely "desouthernized"--at least
     to the point where he felt that the sight of old comrades paying
     tribute to the Union commander would stir his blood as perhaps it
     had not been stirred, even in that earlier time, when that same
     commander had chased him through the Missouri swamps.  <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant</a>,
     indeed, had long since become a hero to Mark Twain, though it is
     highly unlikely that Clemens favored the idea of a third term.]</i>
