DEAR SIR 
</p><p>
When I was at Paris about 10 Days since, I was told that a 
Comet was then visible with a Tail of considerable Length. 
If it has not been yet observed or heard of here, perhaps this 
little Notice may be agreable to you. I returned but last 
Night. I hope you & yours are well, being very sincerely 
</p><p>
Your affectionate Friend 
& Servant 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

I think it was said to be in some Part of the Bull, & in its 
Progress towards the Sun. M. Monnier discovered & 
observed it.
