<a href='/results.php?year=1863'>1863</a>! Why I have hardly become accustomed to 
writing 62 yet! Where has this year gone? With 
all its troubles and anxieties, it is the shortest I ever 
spent! 61 and 62 together would hardly seem three 
hundred and sixty-five days to me. Well, let time 
fly. Every hour brings us nearer our freedom, and we 
are two years nearer peace now than we were when 
South Carolina seceded. That is one consolation. . . . 
I learn, to my unspeakable grief, that the State 
House is burned down.
