SIR, 
</p><p>
The reasons hinted in your Excellency's last favor 
are certainly of such weight as to prevent the flag-of-truce vessels, coming with stores, &c., for the Convention troops, from proceeding further than Hampton Road. Orders are, therefore, issued to-day, for 
vessels of our own to be ready at that place to convey the stores upwards to their destination, under 
the superintendence of proper Commissaries.

My last accounts from the South are unfavorable. 
Georgia is said to be in full possession of the enemy, 
and South Carolina in great danger. The number of 
disaffected there is said to be formidable, and the 
Creek Indians inclining against us. One thousand 
militia are ordered thither from our southern counties ; but a doubt is started whether they are by law 
obliged to march. I have also proposed a scheme to 
embody volunteers for this service; but I fear the 
length of the march, and a general scarcity of bread, 
which prevails in some parts of North Carolina and 
this State, may impede this service. About five hundred militia are ordered down the Tennessee River, 
to chastise some new settlements of renegade Cherokees that infest our south-western frontier, and prevent 
our navigation on that river, from which we began 
to hope for great advantages. Our militia have full 
possession of the Illinois, and the posts on the Wabash; and I am not without hopes that the same 
party may overawe the Indians as far as Detroit. 
They are independent of General McIntosh, whose 
numbers, although upwards of two thousand, I think 
could not make any great progress, on account, it is 
said, of the route they took, and the lateness of the 
season. 
</p><p>
The conquest of Illinois and Wabash was effected 
with less than two hundred men, who will soon be 
reenforced ; and, by holding posts on the back of the 
Indians, it is hoped may intimidate them. Forts 
Natchez and Morishac are again in the enemy's hands ; 
and from thence they infest and ruin our trade on 
the Mississippi, on which river the Spaniards wish to 
open a very interesting commerce with us. I have 
requested Congress to authorize the conquest of those 
two posts, as the possession of them will give a colorable pretence to retain all West Florida, when a 
treaty may "be opened, and, in the mean time, ruin 
our trade in that quarter, which would otherwise be 
so beneficial. I can get no answer to this application, although it is interesting to our back settlements, and not more than four hundred men required 
for the service. 
</p><p>
I beg pardon for intruding these several subjects 
upon you. If you find leisure to make any observations upon them, they will be highly acceptable. 
With every sentiment of regard and esteem, I am, 
dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant,
