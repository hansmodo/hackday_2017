<a rel='month origin' value='11'>November</a> <a rel='day origin' value='6'>6th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>]. Sally Hampton went to Richmond with the Rev. Mr. Martin. She arrived there on Wednesday. On 
Thursday her father, Wade Hampton, fought a great battle, but just did not win it a victory narrowly missed. 
Darkness supervened and impenetrable woods prevented that longed-for consummation. Preston Hampton rode 
recklessly into the hottest fire. His father sent his brother, Wade, to bring h,im back. Wade saw him reel in the saddle 
and galloped up to him, General Hampton following. As young W^ade reached him, Preston fell from his horse, and 
the one brother, stooping to raise the other, was himself shot down. Preston recognized his father, but died without 
speaking a word. Young Wade, though wounded, held his brother's head up. Tom Taylor and others hurried up. The 
General took his dead son in his arms, kissed him, and handed his body to Tom Taylor and his friends, bade them take 
care of Wade, and then rode back to his post. At the head of his troops in the thickest of the fray he directed the fight for 
the rest of the day. Until night he did not know young Wade's fate; that boy might be dead, too! Now, he says, 
no son of his must be in his command. When Wade recovers, he must join some other division. The agony of such a 
day, and the anxiety and the duties of the battle-field it is all more than a mere man can bear.

Another letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a>. She says: " I was dreadfully shocked at Preston Hampton's fate his untimely fate. I know nothing more touching in history than General Hampton's situation at the supremest moment of 
his misery, when he sent one son to save the other and saw both fall; and could not know for some moments whether 
both were not killed/

A thousand dollars have slipped through my fingers already this week. At the Commissary's I spent five hundred 
to-day for candles, sugar, and a lamp, etc. Tallow candles are bad enough, but of them there seems to be an end, 
too. Now we are restricted to smoky, terrabine lamps terrabine is a preparation of turpentine. When the chimney of the lamp cracks, as crack it will, we plaster up the place with paper, thick old letter-paper, preferring the 
highly glazed kind. In the hunt for paper queer old letters come to light.

<a href='/results.php?tla=wts' rel=''>Sherman</a>, in Atlanta, has left Thomas to take care of <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a>. <a href='/results.php?tla=jbh' rel='acquaintance met'>Hood</a> has thirty thousand men, Thomas forty thousand, and as many more to be had as he wants ; he has only to ring the bell and call for them. <a href='/results.php?tla=usg' rel=''>Grant</a> can get all that 
he wants, both for himself and for Thomas. All the world is open to them, while we are shut up in a bastile. We 
are at sea, and our boat has sprung a leak.
