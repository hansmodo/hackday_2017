<a rel='month origin' value='6'>June</a> <a rel='day origin' value='29'>29th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. Mrs. Preston, Mrs. Wigfall, Mary Hammy and I drove in a fine open carriage to see the Champ de Mars. It was a grand tableau out there. <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis</a> rode a beautiful gray horse, the Arab Edwin de Leon brought 
him from Egypt. His worst enemy will allow that he is a 
consummate rider, graceful and easy in the saddle, and Mr. Chesnut, who has talked horse with his father ever since he 
was born, owns that <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis</a> knows more about horses than any man he has met yet. <a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>General Lee</a> was there with 
him; also Joe Davis and Wigfall acting as his aides.

Poor Mr. Lamar has been brought from his camp paralysis or some sort of shock. Every woman in the house 
is ready to rush into the Florence Nightingale business. I think I will wait for a wounded man, to make my first effort 
as Sister of Charity. Mr. Lamar sent for me. As every body went, <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis</a> setting the example, so did I. Lamar 
will not die this time. Will men flatter and make -eyes, until their eyes close in death, at the ministering angels? 
He was the same old Lamar of the drawing-room.

It is pleasant at the President's table. My seat is next 
to Joe Davis, with Mr. Browne on the other side, and Mr. Mallory opposite. There is great constraint, however. As 
soon as I came I repeated what the North Carolina man said on the cars, that North Carolina had 20,000 men ready 
and they were kept back by <a href='/results.php?tla=lew' rel=''>Mr. Walker</a>, etc. The President caught something of what I was saying, and asked me 
to repeat it, which I did, although I was scared to death. "Madame, when you see that person tell him his statement 
is false. We are too anxious here for troops to refuse a man who offers himself, not to speak of 20,000 men." Silence ensued of the most profound.

Uncle H. gave me three hundred dollars for his daughter Mary's expenses, making four in all that I have of hers. 
He would pay me one hundred, which he said he owed my husband for a horse. I thought it an excuse to lend me 
money. I told him I had enough and to spare for all my needs until my Colonel came home from the wars.

Ben Allston, the Governor's son, is here came to see 
me ; does not show much of the wit of the Petigrus ; pleasant person, however. Mr. Brewster and Wigfall came at 
the same time. The former, chafing at Wigf all's anomalous position here, gave him fiery advice. Mr. Wigfall was 
calm and full of common sense. A brave man, and with out a thought of any necessity for displaying his temper, 
he said: " Brewster, at this time, before the country is strong and settled in her new career, it would be disastrous 
for us, the head men, to engage in a row among ourselves.

As I was brushing flies away and fanning the prostrate Lamar, I reported <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis's</a> conversation of the night 
before. " He is all right," said Mr. Lamar, " the fight had to come. We are men, not women. The quarrel had lasted 
long enough. We hate each other so, the fight had to come. 
Even Homer's heroes, after they had stormed and scolded enough, fought like brave men, long and well. If the athlete, Sumner, had stood on his manhood and training and struck back when Preston Brooks assailed him, Preston 
Brooks's blow need not have been the opening skirmish of the war. Sumner's country took up the fight because he 
did not. Sumner chose his own battle-field, and it was the worse for us. What an awful blunder that Preston 
Brooks business was ! : Lamar said Yankees did not fight for the fun of it ; they always made it pay or let it alone.

Met Mr. Lyon with news, indeed a man here in the midst of us, taken with <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln's</a> passports, etc., in his 
pocket a palpable spy. Mr. Lyon said he would be hanged in all human probability, that is. 
</p><p>
A letter from my husband written at Camp Pickens, and saying : "If you and Mrs. Preston can make up your 
minds to leave Richmond, and can come up to a nice little country house near Orange Court House, we could come to 
see you frequently while the army is stationed here. It would be a safe place for the present, near the scene of 
action, and directly in the line of news from all sides." So we go to Orange Court House.

Read the story of Soulouque, the Haytian man : he has wonderful interest just now. Slavery has to go, of course, 
and joy go with it. These Yankees may kill us and lay waste our land for a while, but conquer us never !
