My Dear Prizer:--Another week is ended, another week's work is over, and we are one week nearer the grave.

When your letter reached me, I received one from Panama, but who in the deuce it could be from I could not imagine. However, upon breaking the seal, judge my surprise to find a letter from Frederick E. Foster, dated ' Panama Herald office, July 3d, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1851">1851</a>.' It appears that he had started for California, but being seized there with a pecuniary disease such as I have felt on more than one occasion he was unable to proceed. To replenish his exhausted coffers, he wisely went to work sticking type and writing editorials. Fred has had some sharp lessons since he left the old Record office. Ditto of Christman.

But my voyage, what has it been? After a little Fourth of July excursion of eight months' duration, I find that I have drifted round Cape Horn and landed on the western shores of the Continent, in El Dorado, on a kind of half and half wild goose chase. Accursed gold.

    Ah, why was ruin so attractive made,<br/>
    Oh, why fond man so easily betrayed!

Think not by this that I am disheartened. Far be that from me. Persevere is the sentiment. I am only a little tired of our barbarous, semi-civilized mode of living. Can we ever look for a reunion of the four youthful spirits who entered the Record office a few years ago? If that cannot be, I hope to meet them one by one
some where on this terrestrial globe. Where will we be at the end of the next four years?

You must have had a splendid time during exhibition week, with Indians, pretty girls, etc. But some of the latter you have all the time, and the Indians you should see in their native costume, perfectly nude except a breechclout below the waist, at least the wild Indians here go in that state. I have seen numbers of them.

You say that Clint will be quite formidable with the ladies if he returns with 'a pocketful of rocks!' None of us has as yet gathered a very large 'pile,' but we expect to remain until we do make something, if that is forever. I am doing very well now, and shall continue as long as I can clear three or four dollars per day.

I hope Mr. Evans will be successful in receiving the nomination for the Senate. I think it would be of some benefit to you, either an increase of wages or a permanent interest in the establishment. I should like to have an interest in a paper like the Record. I now receive the West Chester papers middling regularly.
</p><p>
Haines, Atkins and Davis are all in this neighborhood. I should like to go home now, but I came here for pecuniary benefit. I shall remain here another year or so if all goes well as at present. Remember me to all my friends. Write me often.
</p><p>
As ever your friend,
</p><p>

Have you any notion of coming to California?
