My dear Marquis, 
</p><p>
The last letter that I have had the pleasure of receiving from you is dated the 3d instant. I have 
since that heard a thousand vague reports of your situation, and that of the enemy, but none of them satisfactory. I fear some of your letters have miscarried, 
as, from your usual punctuality, I am certain you must 
have written in that time. I hope your next will confirm the accounts, which I have this day received from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='co-worker'>General St. Clair</a>, that Lord Cornwallis had retreated 
to the south side of James River. 
</p><p>
The army moved out of their quarters a few days 
ago, and have taken their first position on this ground. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a>, with the van of the French 
army, will be at Newtown, forty-two miles from hence, 
this night. You are acquainted with our general plan. 
Particulars I dare not enter into, before I am assured from yourself, that there is no danger of any letters fulling among those clouds of light troops, which you tell now surrounded Lord Cornwallis's army. I enclose 
a paper, containing some very agreeable accounts from 
India. I hope, from the circumstance of a part of 
them being published by the East India House in 
London, that they are well founded. Be assured, my 
dear Marquis, that my anxiety to hear from you is 
increased by my sincere regard for you, and by the 
interest I take in every thing which concerns you. 
Believe me to be, most affectionately, &,c. 
</p>
