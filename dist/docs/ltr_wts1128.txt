Dear Brother : I am just in receipt of your letter and 
am glad the Secretary remembered my remark, that to 
accomplish the only purposes for which Kentucky can be 
used there should be a force here of 200,000 men. My 
force is ridiculously small and I think to [augment] it by 
driblets. Look at the fact we know the South is all 
arms and prepared and must have Kentucky ; for it they 
will struggle. They see us under-valuing their force. 
They have already invaded the state with five times my 
forces and are gradually preparing for an onset. I know 
their leaders and their designs, and feel that I am to be 
sacrificed. The Western part of the state is now in their 
possession. They have about 6000 men in the Valley of 
the Big Sandy, 6000 or 7000 at Cumberland Gap and 
Ford, and I doubt not at least 35,000 in front of me, 
with nothing between us but Green River, now fordable, 
and about 23 miles of intervening country. (Indiana is 
devoid of arms, so is Ohio and the North- West, and to 
my crying demand for arms they send me a few hundreds 
of condemned European muskets, whilst the people ask 
for rifles, i We have called on the Kentuckians to form 
regiments and they are responding slowly to be sure but 
when they come for arms I can only answer I have none, 
or such as they won't touch. I tell you, and warn you 
of the danger so far as my power goes. I cannot promise 
to prevent the enemy reaching the Ohio river at a hundred different points-j Our camps are full of their spies 
and the people here all prefer their Southern connections. ... I am compelled to distribute them [troops] 
on three weak lines all dependent on railroads which 
may at any moment be interrupted, also on telegraphs 
which are daily cut. A reverse to any one of these 
might be fatal to all, yet I cannot do otherwise. The 
forces up Sandy must be driven or threatened from the 
direction of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>. Those at Cumberland Gap from Dick 
Robinson, and those over Green River from here; this 
is the most important point and the most in danger. 
The Southern army wants it with its mills, foundries, 
shops, and all the affairs of a city, besides the control of 
the river. . . . Yours, 
</p><p>
