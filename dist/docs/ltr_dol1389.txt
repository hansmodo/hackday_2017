I have the happiness to assure you, my dear cousin, that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="spouse met">Mr. Madison</a> recovers ; 
for the last three weeks his fever has been so slight as to permit him to take bark 
every hour and with good effect. It is three weeks now I have nursed him, night 
and day, sometimes with despair ! but now that I see he will get well I feel as if 
I might die myself from fatigue. Adieu !

Ever yours,
