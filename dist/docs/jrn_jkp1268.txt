Col. Benton called again this morning and resumed the examination of that part of my message which I submitted to him on yesterday in relation to the war with Mexico. I had proposed in my draft to submit to Congress the propriety, at the same time that the war should be vigorously prosecuted, to establish a line of boundary securing to the United States a sufficient territory to afford indemnity for the expenses of the war, and to  our citizens who hold pecuniary demands against Mexico. I proposed, also, that a more permanent government should be provided by Congress over the conquered provinces than the temporary governments which had been established by our naval and military commanders according to the laws of war. Col. Benton thought these passages should be omitted, and submitted to me in writing the reasons for this opinion.
