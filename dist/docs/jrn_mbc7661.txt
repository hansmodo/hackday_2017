Think of Rice, Mr. Senator Rice, who sent us the buffalo-robes. I see from his place in the Senate that he 
speaks of us as savages, who put powder and whisky into soldiers canteens to make them mad with ferocity in the 
fight. No, never. We admire coolness here, because we lack it; we do not need to be fired by drink to be brave. 
My classical lore is small, indeed, but I faintly remember something of the Spartans who marched to the music of 
lutes. No drum and fife were needed to revive their fainting spirits. In that one thing we are Spartans.

The Wayside Hospital is duly established at the Columbia Station, where all the railroads meet. All honor to 
Mrs. Fisher and the other women who work there so faith fully ! The young girls of Columbia started this hospital. 
In the first winter of the war, moneyless soldiers, sick and wounded, suffered greatly when they had to lie over here 
because of faulty connections between trains. Rev. Mr. Martin, whose habit it was to meet trains and offer his aid 
to these unfortunates, suggested to the Young Ladies Hospital Association their opportunity ; straightway the blessed 
maidens provided a room where our poor fellows might have their wounds bound up and be refreshed. And now, 
the " Soldiers Rest " has grown into the Wayside Hospital, and older heads and hands relieve younger ones of the 
grimmer work and graver responsibilities. I am ready to help in every way, by subscription and otherwise, but too 
feeble in health to go there much.

Mrs. Browne heard a man say at the Congaree House, "We are breaking our heads against a stone wall. We are bound to be conquered. We can not keep it up much longer against so powerful a nation as the United States. Crowds of Irish, Dutch, and Scotch are pouring in to swell their armies. They are promised our lands, and they believe 
they will get them. Even if we are successful we can not live without Yankees." " Now," says Mrs. Browne, " I 
call that man a Yankee spy." To which I reply, " If he I were a spy, he would not dare show his hand so plainly." 
</p><p>
" To think," says Mrs. Browne, " that he is not taken up. <a href='/results.php?tla=wls' rel=''>Seward's</a> little bell would tinkle, a guard would come, 
and the Grand Inquisition of America would order that man put under arrest in the twinkling of an eye, if he had 
ventured to speak against Yankees in Yankee land."

General Preston said he had " the right to take up any one who was not in his right place and send him where he 
belonged" Then do take up my husband instantly. He is sadly out of his right place in this little Governor's Council." The general stared at me and slowly uttered in his most tragic tones, " If I could put him where I think he 
ought to be ! " This I immediately hailed as a high compliment and was duly ready with my thanks. Upon reflection, 
it is borne in upon me, that he might have been more explicit. He left too much to the imagination.

Then Mrs. Browne described the Prince of Wales, whose manners, it seems, differ from those of Mrs. , who arraigned us from morn to dewy eve, and upbraided us with our ill-bred manners and customs. The Prince, when he 
was here, conformed at once to whatever he saw was the way of those who entertained him. He closely imitated 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jeb' rel=''>President Buchanan's</a> way of doing things. He took off his gloves at once when he saw that the President wore 
none. He began by bowing to the people who were presented to him, but when he saw <a href='/results.php?tla=jeb' rel=''>Mr. Buchanan</a> shaking 
hands, he shook hands, too. When smoking affably with Browne on the White House piazza, he expressed his content with the fine cigars Browne had given him. The President said : I was keeping some excellent ones for you, but 
Browne has got ahead of me." Long after <a href='/results.php?tla=jeb' rel=''>Mr. Buchanan</a> had gone to bed, the Prince ran into his room in a jolly, 
boyish way, and said : <a href='/results.php?tla=jeb' rel=''>Mr. Buchanan</a>, I have come for the fine cigars you have for me.

As I walked up to the Prestons , along a beautiful shaded back street, a carriage passed with Governor Means 
in it. As soon as he saw me he threw himself half out and 
kissed both hands to me again and again. It was a whole-souled greeting, as the saying is, and I returned it with my 
whole heart, too. " Good-by," he cried, and I responded Good-by." I may never see him again. I am not sure that I did not shed a few tears.

General Preston and Mr. Chesnut were seated on the piazza of the Hampton house as I walked in. I opened my 
batteries upon them in this scornful style : " You cold, formal, solemn, overly-polite creatures, weighed down by your 
own dignity. You will never know the rapture of such a sad farewell as John Means and I have just interchanged. 
He was in a hack, I proceeded to relate, and I was on the sidewalk. He was on his way to the Avar, poor fellow. The 
hackman drove steadily along in the middle of the street; but for our gray hairs I do not know what he might have 
thought of us. John Means did not suppress his feelings at an unexpected meeting with an old friend, and a good 
cry did me good. It is a life of terror and foreboding we lead. My heart is in my mouth half the time. But you 
two, under no possible circumstances could you forget your manners."

Read Russell's India all day. Saintly folks those English when their blood is up. Sepoys and blacks we do not 
expect anything better from, but what an example of Christian patience and humanity the white " angels " from the 
West set them.

The beautiful Jewess, Rachel Lyons, was here to-day. She flattered Paul Hayne audaciously, and he threw back the ball.

To-day I saw the Rowena to this Rebecca, when Mrs. Edward Barnwell called. She is the purest type of AngloSaxon exquisitely beautiful, cold, quiet, calm, lady-like, fair as a lily, with the blackest and longest eyelashes, and 
her eyes so light in color some one said " they were the hue of cologne and water." At any rate, she has a patent 
right to them; there are no more like them to be had. The effect is startling, but lovely beyond words.

Blanton Duncan told us a story of Morgan in Kentucky. Morgan walked into a court where they were trying some 
Secessionists. The Judge was about to pronounce sentence, but Morgan rose, and begged that he might be allowed to 
call some witnesses. The Judge asked who were his witnesses. " My name is John Morgan, and my witnesses are 
1,400 Confederate soldiers.

Mrs. Izard witnessed two instances of patriotism in the caste called " Sandhill tackeys." One forlorn, chill, and 
fever-freckled creature, yellow, dirty, and dry as a nut, was selling peaches at ten cents a dozen. Soldiers collected 
around her cart. She took the cover off and cried, " Eat away. Eat your fill. I never charge our soldiers any 
thing." They tried to make her take pay, but when she steadily refused it, they cheered her madly and said: 
" Sleep in peace. Now we will fight for you and keep off the Yankees. Another poor Sandhill man refused to sell 
his cows, and gave them to the hospital.
