SIR, 
</p><p>
I have received your Excellency's favor of the 14th 
instant, this day, and that of the 4th, a few days 
since. 
</p><p>
It would give me pleasure to consent to let three troops of Jersey horse enter into the Continental service till the opening of the next campaign, as it 
would not only give me an opportunity of obliging 
your Excellency, but would be of service to the troops 
in acquiring skill and experience, which they would 
afterwards introduce into our other squadrons. But, 
from our present situation, I think we could not spare 
more than one. 
</p><p>
With your request of the 14th I shall comply, as 
far as possible, and endeavour to procure, to-morrow,a resolution of both Houses to authorize the President and Council of Safety to impress wagons for a 
limited time. But these,, Sir, are very temporary expedients. It is impossible for this State to cure the 
blunders of those whose business it is to provide the 
army ; and, considering what New Jersey has suffered 
by the war, I am pretty certain it cannot hold out 
another year, if the rest will not furnish their pro 
portionable share of provisions ; and, for my own part, 
though I would rather spend the remainder of my 
days in a wigwam at Lake Erie, than be the most 
splendid vassal of any arbitrary prince on earth, I 
am so discouraged by our public mismanagement, and 
the additional load of business thrown upon me by 
the villany of those who pursue nothing but accumulating fortunes to the ruin of their country, that I 
almost sink under it. I do not say this, Sir, to discourage you from applying to me at any time for 
any thing that is in my power to do, assuring you 
that it always gives me particular pleasure to contribute in the least to alleviate that burden of yours, to 
which mine does not deserve to be compared. 
</p><p>
I shall pursue the plan, pointed out by the Committee of Congress, for procuring horses. I am, with 
the greatest esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most humble servant, 
</p><p>
