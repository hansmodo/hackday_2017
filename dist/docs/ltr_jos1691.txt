UNITED STATES SENATE CHAMBER, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, March 1, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1868">1868</a>.

Dear Brother : Your letter of the 25th is received. I 
need not say to you that the new events transpiring here 
are narrowly watched by me. So far as I am concerned, 
I mean to give Johnson a fair and impartial trial, and to 
decide nothing until required to do so, and after full 
argument. I regard him as a foolish and stubborn man, 
doing even right things in a wrong way, and in a position where the evil that he does is immensely increased 
by his manner of doing it. He clearly designed to have 
first Grant, and then you, involved in Lorenzo Thomas' 
position, and in this he is actuated by his recent revolt 
against Stanton. How easy it would have been, if he 
had followed your advice, to have made Stanton anxious 
to resign, or what is worse, to have made his position 
ridiculous. By his infernal folly we are drifting into 
turbulent waters. The only way is to keep cool and act 
conscientiously. I congratulate you on your lucky extrication. I do not anticipate civil war, for our proceeding is unquestionably lawful, and if the judgment is 
against the President, his term is just as clearly out as if 
the 4th of March, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1869">1869</a>, was come. The result, if he is convicted, would cast the undivided responsibility of reconstruction upon the Republican party, and would unquestionably secure the full admission of all the States by 
^July next, and avoid the dangerous questions that may 
otherwise arise out of the Southern vote in the Presidential election. It is now clear that Grant will be a candidate, and his election seems quite as clear. The action 
of North Carolina removed the last doubt of his nomination. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
