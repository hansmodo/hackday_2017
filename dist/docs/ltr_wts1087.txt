My Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
The peninsula of Florida is of the latest geological formation, one mass of sand, with few rocks of the softest consistency, and, were it not for its delightful climate, would 
be as barren as the deserts of Africa. It is cut up by 
innumerable rivers, streams, and rivulets, which, watering the soil, nourish a rank growth of weeds and grass, 
which, continually decomposing, gives a rich soil, and 
gives rise in time to a heavy growth of live oak, palmetto, 
and scrub of every kind. These are the dreaded hummocks, the stronghold of the Indians, where he builds his 
hut, and has pumpkin and corn fields. The stream furnishes him with abundance of fish and alligators, the 
palmetto its cabbage. The thick growth conceals his 
little fire and hut, secures his escape, enables him to 
creep within a few yards of the deer or turkey feeding 
on the border, and drive his copper-headed, barbed arrow 
through the vital part. In a word, the deep streams, 
bordered by the dense hummock, have enabled the Indians 
thus far to elude the pursuit of our army. 
</p><p>
The remainder of the country is so very level that 
water will not flow off, but collects in ponds until absorbed by the sand or evaporated. These ponds are met 
at every few yards, sometimes miles in extent and but 
few inches in depth, at other places narrow and boggy. 
All else is pine barren, and of course monotonous. 
</p><p>
As to the history of the war, the same as all our 
Indian wars. A treaty for the removal is formed by a 
few who represent themselves as the whole; the time 
comes, and none present themselves. The Government 
orders force to be used ; the troops in the territory commence, but are so few that they all get massacred. The 
cowardly inhabitants, instead of rallying, desert their 
homes and sound the alarm-call for assistance. An army 
supposed to be strong enough is sent, seeks and encounters the enemy at a place selected by the latter, gets 
a few hundred killed. The Indians retreat, scatter, and 
are safe. This may be repeated ad infinitum. The best 
officer is selected to direct the affairs of the army, 
comes to Florida, exposes himself, does all he can, gets 
abused by all, more than likely breaks down his constitution, and is glad enough to get out of the scrape. 
Treaties, truces, and armistices have been and are still 
being tried, with what success is notorious. The present 
mode of conducting things is to dispose the troops at 
fixed points, and require them to scout and scour the 
country in their vicinity, about as good a plan as 
could be adopted, and one which would terminate the 
war if small columns of a hundred or a hundred and 
fifty men were to make excursions into the interior. 
We have from this post thoroughly expelled the Indians 
from this section of the territory, and have had the good 
luck to kill some and capture others, besides destroying 
and capturing boats, canoes, etc. The same has been 
done below and throughout that district where war 
prevails. 
</p><p>
In the west, there is peace. General A is buying them up, and, what is to be wondered at, has 
learned wisdom by experience. You doubtless know 
that he was most egregiously hoaxed last fall by them, 
but now he places all who come in under a strong guard, 
so they can't get off this time. Some natter themselves 
that there is hope of the war's ending this summer, but 
I think there is no probability, as they have burnt their 
fields and hunting-grounds to the west and northwest of 
us, and Sam Jones and Coacoocher are still out, and have 
not the least notion of coming in whilst they are so strong. 
</p><p>
We have just returned from a very pleasant scout, 
having been eight days out, examining several streams 
that empty south of us, without, however, accomplishing 
anything or seeing any sights except those left by a hunting party some ten or twelve days previous. We went 
to Jupiter, famous for the grab by General Jesup ; from 
this place we went out to the battle-ground on the Locha 
Hatchee, where the Indians made a stand against General 
Jesup in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1838">1838</a>. It was a dense hummock on the stream 
called Locha Hatchee, where the army was to pass on 
the way to Jupiter. The trees were riddled with balls, 
and several of our men, who had been at the battle, 
pointed out the trees behind which Captain Such-a-one 
and Lieutenant Such, etc., etc., stood; the limb over 
which our men crossed to get at the enemy; how the 
general got his spectacles smashed by a ball, etc., etc. ; 
how the volunteer militia, as usual, were seized with a 
panic, gathered together like sheep, presenting a sure 
target for the Indians, which of course was not allowed 
to pass unheeded. Your affectionate brother,
