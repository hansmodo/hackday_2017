MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
WE lodged at Monroe's, in Marlborough, on Wednesday night ; at Hitchcock's, in Brookfield, Thursday 
night ; at David Bull's, in <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, Friday night, and 
at Lovejoy's, in Stratford, last night. I have been to 
hear sound orthodox Calvinism from Mr. Stebbins, 
this morning. 
</p><p>
At <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a> I saw Mr. Adet's note, in folio, to our 
Secretary of State, and I find it an instrument well calculated to reconcile me to private life. It will purify 
me from all envy of <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, or Mr. Pinckney, or <a href='/results.php?tla=aab' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Burr</a>, or Mr. any body who may be chosen President or Vice President. Although, however, I think 
the moment a dangerous one, I am not scared. Fear 
takes no hold of me and makes no approaches to me 
that I perceive, and if my country makes just claims 
upon me, I will be as I ever have been, prompt to 
share fates and fortunes with her. I dread not a war 
with France or England, if either forces it upon us, 
but will make no aggression upon either with my free 
will, without just and necessary cause and provocation. In all events of peace or war, I think prices 
must fall considerably before spring, lands, labor, pro 
visions and all. 
</p><p>
We have had so cold a journey thai I fear our 
stone wall stands still. If it does, however, I sup 
pose manure, or ploughing, or cutting and carting 
wood, will furnish employment enough. 
</p><p>
Nothing mortifies me more than to think how the 
English will be gratified at this French flight. John 
Bull will exult and shrug his shoulders like a French 
man, and I fear, show us some cunning, insidious 
kind of kindness upon the occasion. I should dread 
his kindness as much as French severity, but will be 
the dupe of neither. If I have looked with any ac 
curacy into the hearts of my fellow citizens, the 
French will find, as the English have found, that feelings may be stirred which they never expected to find 
there, and that, perhaps, the American people them 
selves are not sensible are within them. 
</p><p>
I shall write you from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. This cold weather makes me regret the loss of my bed and fireside, and especially the companion and delight of both. 
</p><p>
