Sir, 
</p><p>
As it is understood that the bill for fortifying the ports and harbours has passed into a law, I beg leave respectfully to lay before you the following 
thoughts upon the manner of executing this business. The operation of the Federal Government upon the State Governors and State officers, it is well known, 
has been, in general, rather irksome than otherwise, 
as it has tended to lessen their patronage and influence, and perhaps, in their opinion, of course somewhat to impair their dignity, when compared with 
their situation under the Confederation. The Governors are Commanders-in-chief of the militia of their 
respective States, and, as such, were the last year called upon, in the name of the President of the United States, to perform certain unpleasant duties 
relative to the preservation of our neutrality. 
</p><p>
These observations are made with this view, that it would most probably be a conciliatory and grateful measure to them, as Commanders of the militia, 
to be the Agents of the United States, in a certain degree, of the proposed fortifications. For instance, the Engineers might be desired to consult and take 
the opinions of the Governors upon the points most proper to be fortified, and to report to them the reasons on which their opinions should be founded, which 
opinions the Governors might confirm or reject, and transmit the result to the Secretary of War, in order to be submitted to the President of the United 
States. The Governors might also be required to appoint some suitable person to superintend the erection of the works, the keeping of the accounts, &c., 
and also of the mounting of such cannon as are to be mounted in, or furnished by, the respective States. 
</p><p>
By an arrangement of this sort, it is conceived that the Governors would be kindly brought to act by system to support the General Government, and that, 
unless something of this nature shall be devised, they might be displeased and disgusted. Some Agents must be appointed. The Governors are on the spot. 
and well acquainted with characters, and really possess higher responsibility than any other individuals. 
It may, therefore, perhaps be expedient, in an economical as well as political view, to request their assistance on this occasion. Whether these ideas be 
well founded, or not, is respectfully submitted. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
