Dear Brother: 
</p><p>
I am just back from Little Rock, have read the 
message and all the reports which seem satisfactory. 
Grant's report is all I ask, but no one ever has and may 
not agree with me as to the very great importance of the 
march north from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=savannah" rel="city">Savannah</a>. The march to the sea 
seems to have captivated everybody, whereas it was 
child's play compared with the other. All well with me. 
I will write soon.
