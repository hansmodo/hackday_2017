<i>biograper's note</i><p>[City Point was an important strategic point on the James where this
river is joined by the Appomattox. Here General Grant had headquarters
until the end of the campaign against Lee. The campaign against Atlanta
under General Sherman lasted from May 6th to September 2d, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1864">1864</a>, when
the city was evacuated by Hood. The loss of Atlanta was a severe blow
to the South.]</p><hr>

DEAR FATHER:
</p><p>
Your last letter is just received. Before you receive this it is
probable Beverly Simpson will be in service if he comes in at all. If
he does enlist, however, after you receive this tell him to ask to be
assigned to a regiment now with the Army of the Potomac. If he is
already in service have him write to me and I will assign him to some
duty either with me or where it will be equally pleasant for him.
</p><p>
Your theory about delays, either with <a href="/results.php?tla=wts" rel="co-worker met">Sherman</a> or myself, was not
correct. Our movements were co-operative but after starting each one
has done all that he felt himself able to do. The country has been
deceived about the size of our armies and also as to the number of the
enemy. We have been contending against forces nearly equal to our own,
moreover always on the defensive and strongly intrenched.--Richmond
will fall as Atlanta has done and the rebellion will be suppressed in
spite of rebel resistance and Northern countenance and support.
</p><p>
Julia and children are in Philadelphia. If I can get a house there, I
will make that my home. Julia is very desirous that Jennie should make
her home with us if she will, and if she will not do that, at least
spend the fall and winter with us.
</p>
ULYSSES.
