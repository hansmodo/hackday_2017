DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I this moment received a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> at 
Sorel, dated at 4 o clock yesterday evening, informing me that 
a body of the King's troops and a number of ships were between him and Three Rivers, and that he soon expected to be 
attacked. I have sent every man that could be spared to his 
assistance, but am fearful he will be obliged to abandon his 
post. If the enemy land on that side, I am fearful they will endeavour to possess themselves of <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a> and St. John s. 
If they come upon this side (on which they are at present), 
we must evacuate this town. Some days since the sick and 
baggage have been removed to St. John s. I am now removing  a parcel of goods I have seized for the use of the army. 
I expect to have all over this evening. I shall retain only 
four or five hundred men to garrison the place, until I receive 
orders to leave it, or am obliged to quit it by superior force. 
Out of upwards of eight thousand men in this country, not five 
thousand effectives can be mustered. The smallpox has broke 
and divided the army in such a manner that it is almost 
ruined. 
</p><p>
Our want of almost every necessary for the army, and repeated misfortunes and losses, have greatly dispirited the troops. 
Our enemies are daily increasing, and our friends deserting us. 
Under these discouragements and obstacles, with a powerful army 
against us, well disciplined, and wanting in no one article to 
carry on their operations, it will be a miracle, if we keep the 
country. My only expectation is to secure our retreat to St. 
John's or the Isle-aux-Noix, where it will doubtless be thought 
necessary to make a stand ; for which purpose all the bateaux 
and vessels on your side the Lake, that can be spared, should 
be sent over. Our gondolas we shall be obliged to destroy. 
Others ought immediately to be taken in hand to secure the Lake. The enemy, I am well informed, have brought a number with them, framed and done to put up in a short time. 
The want of a little attention in time has lost us this fine 
country. I hope for better things on your side, and that, in 
the rotation of fortune, something better will turn up for us 
here. In every vicissitude of fortune, I am, with great esteem 
and affection, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
