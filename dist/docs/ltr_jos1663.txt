Dear Brother : Your letter of Aug. 13, with enclosures, 
was received. I have read carefully your general orders 
enclosed and also your order on the employment of 
negroes. I see no objection to the latter except the doubt 
and delay caused by postponing the pay of negroes until 
the courts determine their freedom. As the act securing 
their freedom is a military rule, you ought to presume 
their freedom until the contrary is known and pay them 
accordingly. . . . 
</p><p>
You can form no conception at the change of opinion 
here as to the Negro Question. Men of all parties who 
now appreciate the magnitude of the contest and who are 
determined to preserve the unity of the government at all 
hazards, agree that we must seek the aid and make it the 
interests of the negroes to help us. Nothing but our 
party divisions and our natural prejudice of caste has 
kept us from using them as allies in the war, to be used 
for all purposes in which they can advance the cause of 
the country. Obedience and protection must go together. 
When rebels take up arms, not only refuse obedience but 
resist our force, they have no right to ask protection in 
any way. And especially that protection should not 
extend to a local right inconsistent with the general 
spirit of our laws and the existence of which has been 
from the beginning the chief element of discord in the 
country. I am prepared for one to meet the broad issue 
of universal emancipation. . . . 
</p><p>
By the way, the only criticism I notice of your management in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a> is your leniency to the rebels. I 
enclose you an extract. I take it that most of these complaints are groundless, but you can see from it the point 
upon which public opinion rests. The energy and bitterness which they have infused into the contest must be 
met with energy and determination. . . . 
</p><p>
Such is not only the lesson of history, the dictate of 
policy, but it is the general popular sentiment. I know 
you care very little for the latter. . . . 
</p><p>
It is sometimes passionate, hasty and intemperate, but 
after a little fluctuation it settles very near the true line. 
You notice that Fremont, Butler, Mitchell, Turchin and 
Cochran are popular, while Buell, Thomas, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gbm" rel="colleague met">McClellan</a> 
and others are not. It is not for military merit, for most 
persons concede the inferiority in many respects of the 
officers first named, but it is because these officers agree 
with and act upon the popular idea. . . . 
</p><p>
I want to visit you in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a> and if possible go see 
the 64th and 65th. If it is possible or advisable, let me 
know and give me directions how to get there. It is but 
right that I should see the regiments I organized, and 
besides I should like to see you if I should not incommode you and interfere with your public duties. . . . 
</p><p>
Since my return I have spent most of my time in my 
Library. I have always felt that my knowledge of 
American politics was rather the superficial view of the 
politician and not accurate enough for the position 
assigned me. I therefore read and study more and speak 
less than usual. . . . 
</p><p>
We all wait with intense anxiety the events impending in Virginia. We all fear results for a month to 
come. Now is the chance for the rebels. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours,
