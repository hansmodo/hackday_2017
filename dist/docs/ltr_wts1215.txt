HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES,

Dear Brother : . . . No matter how unwise were my 
conditions with Johnston they were secret, and his [Stanton's] divulgence was a betrayal of me; and Stanton 
knew it. At all events, he himself made so much 
clamor that history is not perfect unless the matter be 
wholly explained, and I think I have done it fairly. 1

... I believe, had I submitted to Stanton's and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a>'s insults of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1865">1865</a>, I should have been swept aside 
like any other piece of war rubbish at the reorganization 
of the army. . . . 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately,
