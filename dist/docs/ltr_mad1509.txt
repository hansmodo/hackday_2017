DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 14th instant came to hand on 
thursday. A proposition was made a few days ago for this 
State to empower Congress to carry into effect the imposts, as 
soon as twelve States should make themselves parties to it. It 
was rejected on the following grounds: 1. That it would present a disagreeable aspect of our affairs to foreign Nations. 2. 
That it might lead to other combinations of lesserv.umbers of 
the States. 3. That it would render Rhode Island an inlet for 
clandestine trade. 4. That it would sour her temper still 
further, at a crisis when her concurrence in some general and 
'radical amendment of the Confederation may be invited by 
Congress. 5. That the chance is almost infinitely against a 
union of twelve States on such new ground, and consequently 
the experiment would be only a fresh display of the jarring 
policy of the States, and afford a fresh triumph and irritation 
to Rhode Island.

The act empowering Congress to surrender Citizens of this 
State to the Sovereign demanding them, for certain crimes committed within his jurisdiction, has passed. Congress are to 
judge whether the crimes be such as according to the Law of 
Nations warrant such demand, as well as whether the fact be 
duly proven. Concurrent provision is made for punishing such 
offences by our own laws, in case no such demand be made to 
or be not admitted by Congress, and legal proof can be had. 
The latter law extends to offences against the Indians. As 
these tribes do not observ.the law of Nations, it was supposed 
neither necessary nor proper to give up citizens to them. The 
act is not suspended on the concurrence of any other State, it 
being judged favorable to the interest of this though no other 
should follow the example, and a fit branch of the federal prerogative. The Bill for Assize Courts has passed the Senate 
without any material amendment, is enrolled, and waits only to 
be examined by the Committee and signed by the Speakers. 
The General Assessment, on the question for engrossing it, was 
yesterday carried by 44 against 42. To-day its third reading 
was put off till November next, by 45 against 37, or thereabouts, and it is to be printed for consideration of the people. 
Much business is still on the table, but we shall probably rise 
about New-year's day.

I am, dear sir, with sincere regard, your friend and serv.
