Sir, 
</p><p>
I have duly received the private letter which you 
did me the honor to write me, of the 4th instant. 
</p><p>
It is to be lamented that our system is such as 
still to leave the public peace of the Union at the 
mercy of each State Government. This is not only 
the case as it regards direct interferences, but as it 
regards the inability of the National Government, in 
many particulars, to take those direct measures for 
carrying into execution its views and engagements, 
which exigencies require. For example, a party comes 
from a county of Virginia into Pennsylvania, and 
wantonly murders some friendly Indians. The National Government, instead of having power to apprehend the murderers and bring them to justice, is 
obliged to make a representation to that of Pennsylvania ; that of Pennsylvania, again, is to make a requisition of that of Virginia. And whether the murderers shall be brought to justice at all, must depend 
upon the particular policy, and energy, and good disposition of two State Governments, and the efficacy 
of the provisions of their respective laws. And the 
security of other States, and the money of all, are at 
the discretion of one. These things require a remedy; 
but when it will come, God knows. 
</p><p>
From present appearances, a pretty general Indian 
war is not a little to be apprehended. But there is 
now nothing for it, but to encounter it with vigor; 
and thus far in my department the provisions are 
adequate. I have the honor to remain, with the truest and most respectful attachment, Sir, 
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
