This forenoon Mr. White, late editor of the Herald, with his lady vamosed for Stockton in the stage. I printed five hundred tickets for candidates for election to the assembly, charging five dollars for my services. As soon as this job was finished, learning that a Methodist preacher was holding services in a neighboring tent, I joyfully proceeded to hear the sermon. The tent was filled with monte tables and benches (having been formerly occupied as a gambling house).

I arrived early and took my seat, very few having then assembled. In a few minutes two clergymen, one a young man and the other quite grey, made their appearance. In a quarter of an hour, while the first hymn
was sung, passers-by dropped in until a good congregation was assembled. Some rough-looking, long-bearded fellows dropped in out of curiosity; others nice, tidy, and clean, to worship; some had white shirts, some check, some red flannel; but all bore a haughty, proud, self-reliance in their countenances, and all carried their bowie knives and revolvers in their belts. We listened to a very good sermon and then dispersed.

In the evening a Locofoco meeting was held at which the speakers criminated and blackguarded each other until it almost broke up in a row. I tried my luck tonight; for the first time since leaving San Francisco, at roulette and won $5.25.
