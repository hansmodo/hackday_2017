CAMP WASHINGTON, 
April 6, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>. 
</p><p>
My last was closed on the twenty-eighth ultimo. 
Before now reports of our glorious success here with 
glowing accounts of the ceremonies of the surrender 
on the morning of the twenty-ninth are speeding their 
way to Washington and the world, and it would be 
useless for me to attempt a repetition of what you 
will find detailed so much better in the newspapers. 
However, as the " Magnanimous Mexican Army " 
moved out of the city, we marched in. My company 
of the Fifth and an artillery company moved off to 
the southeast corner of the town to occupy Fort St. 
lago where the first flag of our country which ever 
floated over the walls of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a> was raised by 
Major Martin Scott who was in command. 
</p><p>
As it was run up we fired a national salute from the 
twenty-four-pounders which garnished the fort. The 
navy followed with a tremendous roar of artillery 
from every gun in the fleet.

Colonel Bel ton raised a flag and fired a salute from 
San Juan D Ulloa, as did the officer in command at 
Fort Concepcion at the opposite corner of the town.
