Sir: I have just received your note by Captain Hall, requesting, in the name of <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague">Captain Fremont</a>, that one of the medical officers of the Portsmouth might be ordered to his command. 
However happy, sir, I should feel in complying with the wishes of <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague">Captain Fremont</a> in this respect, there are reasons why, in my view, it would be improper to detach one of them for an 
indefinite period of time from the ship ; but be pleased with my respectful regards to <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague">Captain Fremont</a> to assure him of my readiness to send one my medical officers to his camp, wherever 
that may be, at anytime he may require his services, and also, that I will receive such of my sick 
or wounded countrymen, or others under his command, as shall stand in need of accommodation and medical attendance on board the Portsmouth. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, very respectfully, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
(Signed) <a href="/results.php?tla=jbm" rel="me">Jno. B. Montgomery</a>, 
</p><p>
Commanding U. S. Ship Portsmouth.

To Lieutenant A. H. Gillespie, Sausalito.
