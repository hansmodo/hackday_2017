DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
When I last had the honor of writing to your Excellency, the enemy had not extended their operations beyond their place of arms on Wappoo Neck. 
On the 29th ultimo they crossed Ashley River, in 
force, one mile above the ferry. The next day they 
advanced to Gibbes's, a convenient landing, about two 
miles from town, having previously -collected a number of boats at the opposite shore, for the purpose of 
crossing their heavy artillery and stores. My battalion of light infantry, posted there to prevent a surprise or too sudden approach of the enemy, was 
ordered not to engage seriously, but skirmish with 
advanced parties, retiring slowly and orderly towards 
town, as there was no object in maintaining any advanced post, and the advantages of a serious affair 
were all on the side of the enemy. 
</p><p>
On the night of the 1st instant, the enemy broke 
ground, and have been working slowly ever since. I 
scarcely know how to denominate what they have 
executed hitherto. It consists of several redoubts, 
with a covered communication from right to left, 
which is still unfinished. Their nearest work is an 
inclosed battery on their left, at about the distance 
of six hundred yards, which indus me to believe, 
that they intend the line in question for a first parallel, although some parts of it are rather too remote. 
Our shells and shot have disquieted them, and interrupted their operations; but <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a>, sensible 
of the value of these articles in a siege, economizes 
them as much as possible. Fatigue parties are constantly employed in improving our works. The whole 
front of our lines, within the abatis, is armed with 
wolf-traps. All this affords an excellent defence 
against storm, but must finally yield to a perseverance in regular approaches, which appears to be Clinton's present plan, unless we can work under his fire 
as fast as he can, and afford time for the arrival of 
your Excellency. 
</p><p>
Our obstructions in Cooper River are completed ; 
which gives a prospect of our maintaining a communication with the country, and hitherto prevents 
the accomplishment of the investiture. Since the 
arrival of General Woodford, <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a> will 
have it in his power to execute his plan of establishing the necessary posts for this purpose, on the eastern shore of the river. Colonel Malmedy is to take 
command of the troops destined for that service. 
</p><p>
The enemy's squadron of seven armed ships, three of which are two-deckers, and two transports, availed 
itself of a brisk southern breeze to pass Fort Moultrie yesterday afternoon. The Admiral's ship led the 
van, and escaped without apparent injury; the frigate which followed her. had her fore topmast carried 
away ; a large transport, in the rear of the whole, 
ran aground, and, after receiving some shot from Sullivan's Island, was fired and abandoned by her crew. 
The remainder are now anchored near the ruins of 
Fort Johnson, out of the reach of our cannon. 
</p><p>
My notice of the present opportunity was so sudden, that I have not been able to make atonement 
for my last hurried letter. Helving upon your Excellency's goodness, I have preferred writing, at any 
rate, to total silence, and losing an occasion of repeating the assurances of attachment and veneration, 
with which I have the honor to be, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's faithful Aid, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">JOHN LAURENS</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I beg to be respectfully presented to Mrs. 
<a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>. The reason above mentioned makes me 
trouble your Excellency to present my love to the 
family, as I shall not be able to write to any of 
them.
