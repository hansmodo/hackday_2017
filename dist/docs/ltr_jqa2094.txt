</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
After a detention of twenty days at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=helvoetsluys" rel="city">Helvoetsluys</a>, and a 
pleasant passage of twenty-four hours from thence to Margate, I arrived here on the morning of the nth instant. The 
state of the business on which I came will be known to you 
before the receipt of this letter. 
</p><p>
An English paper that I saw at Rotterdam on the day of 
my departure from the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a> gave me the first information 
of Mr. Randolph's resignation. On my arrival here I found 
a story of its supposed occasion, for which I fear there is too 
much foundation, though I think it must have received high 
aggravations from those who make little scruple of divulg 
ing it. At present I can only suspend my judgment upon 
the degree of misconduct chargeable on him, and still hope 
that he was never influenced by motives more criminal than 
those of a misguided party spirit. I shall reserve for a future letter some observations relative to the means of influence used by a foreign power in the United States, and 
confine myself in this to such observations as have occurred to me on the state of affairs in those parts of Europe the most interesting to our country. 
</p><p>
The new French legislature assumed its functions on the 27th of last month. No account of any very important 
transaction by them has yet reached this country. The members of the Executive directory are Larevelliere-Le-peaux, Letourneur, Rewbell, Barras and Carnot. The 
last was chosen to replace Sieyes, who was in the first appointment by a small majority and declined. 
</p><p>
Carnot was a member of Robespierre's Committee of Public Safety, and I think the only one remaining alive who 
has not been under arrest by order of the Convention, a fate which he very narrowly escaped not more than four months 
ago. He was then spared as was said on account of his military merit, as the design of the campaign which terminated in the conquest of the Netherlands is attributed to him. 
</p><p>
The fluctuation of fortunes and reputations is equally remarkable in the choice of the other members, and even in the consideration of persons who were not chosen. 
</p><p>
Boissy d Anglas, Cambaceres, Lanjuinais, Henry Lariviere, the demi-gods of the month of June, are out of the 
question. The reason is that they were not forward in support of the decree of reelection which produced the late convulsion, 
and the most recent services are the only ones remembered. 
</p><p>
If the tone of the Directory can be anticipated by any 
consideration of the character of its members, it will not be 
remarkable for stability or harmony. The only man whose 
personal character can give him any pretensions to power, 
the only one whose conduct has a system for its basis, Sieves, 
refused the seat that was offered him. It was a place he said 
which required that its holder should possess the general 
confidence, and no man could be more unfit for it than him, 
against whom all parties without exception since the be 
ginning of the Revolution had pointed as a mark. 
</p><p>
Did Sieyes imagine that any other man in France possessed the general confidence, or ever could possess it more 
than three months together? No, for independent of his experience it is not understanding or sagacity that are his 
deficiencies. Could he be serious when he represented him self as having been the special mark of all the successive 
factions? he? Sieyes? the only man of note whom 
every successive faction has spared. The only man extant, 
who from the day when the first Constituent Assembly met 
to the present, has been openly or unseen concerned in the 
most important affairs. The man whose mere existence at this day is a standing miracle, and amounts to proof that 
there are no universalities in nature, and that everything has an exception? No, no. He certainly knew better. 
</p><p>
But he was determined to refuse, and some reason he must give. This was a very good one to profess, it contained an 
eulogium of himself without offending others. It had a natural tendency to increase his influence with those who 
believed his assertion, if any such there were ; and as to those who did not believe him, it may be supposed they were very 
indifferent whether he spoke the truth or not. 
</p><p>
From my arresting your attention so long and repeatedly 
upon the motions of this one man, I hope you will not think 
I give him an importance that he does not deserve. To 
speak my mind freely, I consider him as the main spring of 
the French external policy. I believe, further, that his policy 
as respects the United States is of a tendency as pernicious 
to them, as if it had been invented in the councils of the Prince of Darkness. 
</p><p>
In the present instance he avoids a station of show as he has always uniformly done; he remains in the Council of 
five hundred, and will be satisfied with having the great portion of executive management really in his hands. He is so 
much of a metaphysician that he values the substance more than the appearance of power, and he secures to himself the 
advantage of protection from the most imminent hazards that may attend new Revolutions. 
</p><p>
The new Legislature did not assemble under the fairest 
auspices that could be wished. A civil war in the heart of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> but a few days before stifled in blood, a paper currency 
depreciated to the lowest extreme of sufferance, an expense of more than an hundred daily millions to support, and de 
feat, a word of which they had almost lost the use, attending their armies. Internal discord can scarcely be mentioned 
as one of their distresses, because it has become their ordinary state, and its evils have lost their horror in their frequency ; 
but dissension with their new allies may be added to the list of the embarrassments under which they have yet the courage 
to retain a compulsive hold of the public helm. 
</p><p>
I remain &c.
