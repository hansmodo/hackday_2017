Dear General, 
</p><p>
By a variety of intelligence, from various quarters 
(all which agree) the enemy intend to make an attempt on the fleet and army of our great and good 
ally at this place. I have called for the neighbouring militia of Massachusetts, and the whole of this 
State. I have also requested the Council of Massachusetts to send all the three months' militia this 
way, except those of the counties of Hampshire and 
Berkshire. Whilst these are collecting, with the advice of the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis</a>, I shall call on <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague met'>Governor Trumbull</a> to send one thousand militia from the nearest 
towns of Connecticut, to rendezvous at Greenwich. I 
have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wih" rel="me">William Heath</a>.

P. S. The fleet off the harbour, from their first 
appearance, have kept nearly the same station, to the 
eastward of Block Island.
