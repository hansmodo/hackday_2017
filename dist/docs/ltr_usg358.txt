MY DEAR MR. CRAMER:
</p><p>
Your letter of the 31st of May is just received. I should have written
to you within a day or two to inform you of a slight change of plan,
which will bring me into Copenhagen from ten days to two weeks later
than I wrote you I should be there, even if I had not received your
letter. To save retracing my steps, as I should be obliged to do by the
routes laid out in my last letter, I now intend to go from The Hague to
Berlin and visit a few of the German cities before going to Denmark.
From Copenhagen I shall go by water to Norway, thence to Sweden, St.
Petersburg, Moscow, and to Vienna.
</p><p>
I shall be very glad indeed to see Mary and the children and hope they
may be back by the time I reach Copenhagen, about from the fifth to the
tenth of July.
</p><p>
Jesse sails from Liverpool to-morrow for home. He has been very
homesick for some time.
</p><p>
With best regards of Mrs. Grant and myself, I am,
</p><p>
Very truly,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.
