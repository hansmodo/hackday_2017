 <p>
 To Th. Nast, in Morristown, N. J.:
 </p><p>
HARTFORD, Nov. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1872">1872</a>.
</p><p>
Nast, you more than any other man have won a prodigious victory for
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant</a>--I mean, rather, for civilization and progress.  Those pictures
were simply marvelous, and if any man in the land has a right to hold his
head up and be honestly proud of his share in this year's vast events
that man is unquestionably yourself.  We all do sincerely honor you, and
are proud of you.
</p>
MARK TWAIN.
