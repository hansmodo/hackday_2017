Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your favour of the 15th ult., with the packets mentioned 
in it, arrived in good order. I regret your long silence, 
though I am strongly inclined to rejoice in the cause of it : 
a lit of the gout, it is said, often prolongs life. 
</p><p>
Affairs here begin to wear a better aspect. I am promised 3,000,000 rials, that is, 150,000 dollars, which, though 
inadequate to the demands upon me, is still a great consolation, especially as men who are at the pains of planting 
and watering trees, seldom let them perish for want of a 
few drops extraordinary. 
</p><p>
I scarcely know how to desire you to make further advances on account of our salary, four months of which is 
now due, and yet I find myself under a necessity of doing 
it. My expenses here, notwithstanding the most rigid 
economy, are very great. 
</p><p>
Since writing the above, I have had the pleasure of receiving yours of the 27th January, and sincerely congratulate you on your recovery. The amount of my bill 
on you shall, agreeable to your request, be considered as 
part of the 25,000 dollars. Your reckoning, as to our 
salaries, corresponds with mine, though we have been 
losers by the exchange. 
</p><p>
As to the residue of the 25,000 dollars, my drafts shall 
be entirely regulated by my necessities, and I shall be 
happy if they permit me to leave a considerable proportion 
of that sum in your hands. I shall be constrained, however, 
to call for a part of that sum shortly ; but whether by a bill, 
or by means of the marquis,* is uncertain. As to that 
gentleman's complaint of my reserve towards him, I could 
make many remarks, which, though proper for your perusal, 
ought not to go further. 
</p><p>
A few days after my arrival here, a person, whom I was 
told was the marquis, was introduced to me. He said he 
came to pay me a visit by order of Mr. Grand. I did not 
then know I was indebted to that gentleman for a letter of 
recommendation to the marquis, it not having come to my 
hands. This singularity struck me, though I appeared not 
to observe it. The civilities usual on such occasions 
passed between us, and at parting the marquis gave me a 
general invitation to dine with him whenever I should find 
it convenient. I returned his visit, but as general invitations from strangers pass with us for mere matters of compliment, I declined doing myself the honour of dining with 
him. Interchanges of visits were continued, and the general invitation to dine once or twice repeated. In this line 
my connexion with the marquis remained, until I received 
the offer of the king's responsibility for a loan, &c. Several 
reasons induced me to think it expedient to consult the 
marquis as to the manner of making this offer useful to us. 
I waited upon him for that purpose. He told me he could 
not intermeddle in these affairs without instructions from the 
court; but was nevertheless very civil, and expressed a 
desire of doing me services, &c. As he declined entering 
into particulars, I did not press it ; nor had my ideas of 
his importance risen so high as to reconcile me to the extraordinary and unnecessary measure of applying to the 
court for the instructions in question. I did not, however, 
let him know my sentiments or intentions on the subject. 
It seems he had heard of Mr. Grand having been desired 
by you to make inquiries for money for me, and he advised me to write to him on the subject, which I accordingly did.In his answer of the 21st October, he says, "I am very 
unhappy to hear you are not benefited on the spot by the 
facility tendered to you by the court of Spain, so much 
more so that the nature of circumstances here does not 
admit of the least hope of success. Too many attempts, 
all vainless, have already been made for the good of your 
credit ; adding any more to the numberwould be destructive 
to it entirely, at this particular juncture chiefly when our 
government is about raising a sum of money much more 
enticing and advantageous in its conditions. This perplexing situation suggested me an idea I communicated to Dr. 
Franklin," &c. 
</p><p>
" Meanwhile it is highly important to avail yourself of the 
favourable disposition of the court of Spain, and get it to 
authorize and charge the marquis to help you in your 
finance business. He writes me that without orders he 
cannot take it upon himself. It will be better for your excellency not to consult him before making the application 
to government," &c. 
</p><p>
You, my good friend, have seen and thought too much 
of men and things to need any of my remarks on this 
letter. I replied to it on the 1st November as follows : 
</p><p>
" Sir, 
</p><p>
" I have had the honour of receiving your letter of the 
21st October last. I had flattered myself that a loan on 
reasonable terms and adequate security might have been 
effected for the United States in France ; but as that court 
is raising money on conditions more advantageous and 
agreeable, I am not surprised at our having little prospect 
of success. 
</p><p>
" The hint you gave <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a> was a good one, and I 
hopo will be productive of good consequences. 
</p><p>
"Your obliging advice relative to the marquis, shall meet 
with all the attention due to its importance ; and if that 
measure should, on further consideration, appear expedient, 
it shall be pursued in the manner you recommend. 
</p><p>
The marquis repeating his general invitation about this 
time, I dined with him. He received and entertained me 
very politely. We parted, to appearances, pleased with 
each other ; but he has not been at my house since, though 
a great many visits in my debt. 
</p><p>
Ever since my arrival, I have been particularly cautious 
to avoid offending any person of any rank ; to endeavour to 
please all, without becoming the property or sycophant of 
any. My disagreeable situation was not unknown to him, 
but the inferences he drew from it proved fallacious. I 
never find myself less disposed to humility, or improper 
compliances, than when fortune frowns. I have uniformly 
been very civil, though not confidential, to the marquis, nor 
has any thing harsh ever passed between us. He is a man 
of business, abilities, and observation, and (what is of much 
importance here) of money. He keeps the most, and 
indeed only, hospitable house here, and persons of the first 
rank and fashion are found at his table. His consequence 
at court is unequal to his desires, and I think to his capacity 
of being useful. In a word, he has a good share of sagacity, 
ambition, and pride. I think it probable that we shall yet 
be on more familiar terms ; for though I will never court, I 
shall with pleasure cultivate his acquaintance. 
</p><p>
The Count de Montmorin continues very friendly. I 
believe him to be an able minister, and well attached to 
our cause. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Jay desires me to make her compliments to you. 
I am, dear sir, with sincere attachment and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
