My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
M. de Laforest called just now, while I was at the Minister s, to inform me that he will probably leave Paris tomor 
row morning. I, therefore, write this as an introduction to 
you, and proceed to give a hasty sketch of the form in which 
the business now stands. 
</p><p>
A Commission is named, (the appointments not yet gone 
through the forms,) to consist of four persons. The Minister 
is M. Fauchet, Secretary of the Executive Council, a young 
man of about three and thirty, whom I have not yet seen, but 
he is said to possess genius and information. The Secretary 
of Legation is M. Leblanc, a man of about fifty, and who 
was lately at the head of the Police Department in this city. 
Him also I am, as yet, unacquainted with ; but he is mentioned to me as a prudent, sensible man. 
</p><p>
M. de Laforest goes out as Consul General, and M. Petrie, 
his friend and companion, as Consul in the port of Philadelphia. These two will undoubtedly draw together, and will 
probably sway the conduct of the Commission ; for the Minister is to take no important steps without being previously 
authorised by the Board. 
</p><p>
I understand that a kind of etiquette has been established, 
by which the Consuls, as not being properly diplomatic characters, are not received or invited with the Minister, and I 
perceive that there is a strong wish to enjoy the exterior 
respect of office, as well as the solid authority. I cannot 
pretend to judge, nor even to guess how far anything of this 
sort consists with the general rules, which you may have 
found it proper to establish ; but, I think, I can perceive that 
the two Consuls expect to govern the Commission by two 
means ; one, their greater knowledge of our country, laws, 
and inhabitants ; the other, a persuasion to be inculcated on 
the Minister and Secretary, that they enjoy the confidence of our government. Perhaps a little vanity may also be for 
something in the business ; but your judgment will well discern motives, and, therefore, I only give hints. 
</p><p>
I think that M. de Laforest and his friend, being men of 
understanding, will endeavor to keep things in a line of prudence and propriety ; therefore, being uncertain, at present, 
as to the personal characters of the other two, it seems to be 
well that the Board is to be kept steady by the anchors we 
are acquainted with, and as the others unfold themselves, it 
will appear what reliance can be placed on them. 
</p><p>
The Minister, in the conference I had with him just now, 
has again reiterated the assurance, that he and the other members of this government have the most sincere desire to be on 
the most cordial terms with us, and I am the more disposed 
to believe in their assurances, because America is the only 
source, from whence supplies of provisions can be drawn to 
feed this city, on which so much depends. The coming 
winter will be, I believe, dreadful, and the spring, should the 
war continue, must open with partial scarcities, if not general 
want. To the sufferings, unavoidable from many other 
causes, no small addition will be made by the laws limiting 
prices, enforced by the iron hand of necessity. I am, &c.
