My Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
I have nothing new at all here ; am still expecting to 
be sent away in the spring, but where to is hard to tell. 
I ask no imprudent questions of the authorities at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, but leave them to act as the good of the service 
to them may seem fit. 
</p><p>
We have had a bitter cold winter. The river closed in 
December, and is now closed, not actually frozen over, 
but the floating cakes lodge in a narrow part, about 
eighty miles down the river, called a gorge ; these cakes 
freeze together, and serve as a dam to all the ice up 
stream. Our mails have been entirely interrupted. I 
subscribe to a daily <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> paper, but never receive 
them except occasionally twenty or thirty arrive at once. 
</p><p>
There are the usual clamors against the administration, and all confess that the mails are worse than ever 
before. 
</p><p>
Write me from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> the political news, and 
again let me advise you to shun politics like poison, 
except it advance you in the profession of the law. 
Affectionately your brother, 
</p><p>
