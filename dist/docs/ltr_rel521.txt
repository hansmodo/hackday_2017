My Darling Daughters:  I have just received your joint letter of
October 24th from 'Clydale.'  It was very cheering to me, and the
affection and sympathy you expressed were very grateful to my feelings.
I wish indeed I could see you, be with you, and never again part from
you.  God only can give me that happiness.  I pray for it night and
day.  But my prayers I know are not worthy to be heard.  I received
your former letter in western Virginia, but had no opportunity to
reply to it.  I enjoyed it, nevertheless.  I am glad you do not wait
to hear from me, as that would deprive me of the pleasure of hearing
from you often.  I am so pressed with business.  I am much pleased at
your description of Stratford and your visit.  It is endeared to me
by many recollections, and it has been always a great desire of my
life to be able to purchase it.  Now that we have no other home, and
the one we so loved has been foully polluted, the desire is stronger
with me than ever.  The horse-chestnut you mention in the garden was
planted by my mother.  I am sorry the vault is so dilapidated.  You
did not mention the spring, on of the objects of my earliest
recollections.  I am very glad, my precious Agnes, that you have become
so early a riser.  It is a good habit, and in these times for mighty
works advantage should be taken of every hour.  I much regretted
being obliged to come from Richmond without seeing your poor mother....
This is my second visit to Savannah.  I have been down the coast to
Amelia Island to examine the defenses.  They are poor indeed, and I
have laid off work enough to employ our people a month.  I hope our
enemy will be polite enough to wait for us.  It is difficult to get
our people to realise their position....  Good-bye, my dear daughters.

                         Your affectionate father,
