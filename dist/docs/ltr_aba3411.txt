MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
Can my dear sister realize that it is near eleven 
months since I left her ? To me it seems incredible ; more like a dream than a reality. Yet it 
ought to appear the longest ten months of my life, 
if I were to measure the time by the variety of objects which have occupied my attention ; but, amidst 
them all, my heart returns, like the dove of Noah, 
and rests only in my native land. I never thought 
myself so selfish a being as since I have become a 
traveller ; for, although I see nature around me in 
a much higher state of cultivation than our own 
country can boast, and elegance of taste and manners in a thousand forms, I cannot feel interested in 
them ; it is in vain for me, that here 
</p><p>
" kind Nature wakes her genial power, 
Suckles each herb, and nurtures every flower." 
</p><p>
'T is true the garden yields a rich profusion ; but 
they are neither plants of my hand, nor children of 
my care. I have bought a little bird lately, and I 
really think I feel more attached to that, than to any 
object out of my own family, animate or inanimate. 
Yet I do not consider myself in the predicament of 
a poor fellow, who, not having a house in which to 
put his head, took up his abode in the stable of a 
gentleman ; but, though so very poor, he kept a 
dog, with whom he daily divided the small portion 
of food which he earned. Upon being asked why, 
when he found it so difficult to live himself, he still 
kept a dog ; " What," says the poor fellow, 
" part with my dog ! Why, whom should I have to 
love me then ? " You can never feel the force of 
this reply, unless you were to go into a foreign 
country without being able to speak the language of 
it. I could not have believed, if I had not experienced it, how strong the love of country is in the 
human mind. Strangers from all parts of the country, who visit us, feel more nearly allied than the 
most intimate acquaintance I have in Europe. Before this will reach you, you will have learnt our 
destination to England. Whether it will prove a 
more agreeable situation than the present, will depend much upon the state of politics. We must 
first go to Holland to arrange our affairs there, and 
to take leave of that Court. I shall wish to be moving as soon as my family lessens, it will be so lonesome. We have as much company in a formal way 
as our revenues will admit ; and <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='friend met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, with 
one or two Americans, visits us in the social, friendlv way. I shall really regret to leave <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='friend met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> : he is one of the choice ones of the earth. On 
Thursday, I dine with him at his house. On Sunday, he is to dine here. On Monday, we all dine 
with the Marquis ; and on Thursday we dine with 
the Swedish Ambassador, one of the most agreeable 
men, and the politest gentleman I have met with. 
He lives like a prince. I know you love to know 
all my movements, which makes me so particular to you. 
</p><p>
I have many affairs upon me at present. What 
with my son's going away, my own adjustments for 
a final leave of this country, many things must pass 
through my hands ; but I am the less anxious to 
write, as your nephew will tell you all about us. 
You will think I ought to have written you more 
now ; but I am almost sick of my pen, and I know 
you will see what I write to others. I will not, 
however, close until the day before he quits the house. 
</p><p>
10 May. 
</p><p>
To-morrow morning my son takes his departure 
for America, and we go next week to England. I 
have nothing further to add, than my regards to 
Mr. Cranch, and a desire that you would let me 
hear from you by every opportunity. I shall lose 
part, and the greatest part of American intelligence 
by quitting France ; for no person is so well informed from all the States as the Marquis de la Fayette. 
He has established a correspondence in all the States, 
and has the newspapers from every quarter. 
</p><p>
Adieu. 
</p><p>
A. A.
