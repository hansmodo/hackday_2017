My dear Dr 
</p><p>
After a severe affair of yesterday, principally with 
artillery, with six thousand of the best Mexican troops 
we succeeded after a continued contest of five hours in 
driving the enemy from his position & occupying the 
same laying on our arms ; at day light he was still in 
sight, apparently disposed to renew the contest, but on our making the 
arrangements for doing so he retired on the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoros" rel="city">Matamoros</a> road & took a 
strong position at this place, & awaited the attack which we commenced 
at about four o clock P. M. & after a severe contest of two hours a close 
quarters we succeeded in gaining a complete victory, dispersing them in 
every direction taking their artillery, baggage or means of transportation, a 
number of standards &c, with a great loss of killed, wounded & prisoners, 
one of the first is a Gen of artillery, & among the latter is Gen Lavega 
one of the most accomplished officers of their army ; the war I have no 
doubt is completely brought to a close on this side the Rio Grande ; the 
enemy who escaped having recrossed said river So brilliant an achievement could not be expected without heavy loss on our side, we have 
many killed & wounded among the former is Mr Inge of the dragoons, 
Cockran of the fourth Infy. & Chadbourn of the 8th  among the latter 
is Col Mclntosh Pain Capt Hooe L&lt; Gates Jordon Selden & Burbank & some others besides many n c d officers 8 & privates My 
orders was to make free use of the bayonet, which was done as far as it 
be, or as the enemy would permit I have escaped alth I was as much 
exposed as any one on the ground The fort was safe, but Majr 
Brown9 died to-day from a severe injury he rec d from a shell ; which has 
thrown a gloom over the whole affair My respects to Dr Wells, 10 
Munroe, 11 & Saunders, & I may say any other inquiring friends
