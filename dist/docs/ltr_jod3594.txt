MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YESTERDAY I attended the dedication of a temple. 
The Presbyterian congregation in Market street have 
taken down their old meeting house and erected a 
new one in the same place, much larger, higher, 
more light, airy and elegant. They assembled in it 
for the first time yesterday, when Dr. Ewing preached 
in the morning, and Dr. Blair in the afternoon. 
</p><p>
I recollected with pleasure, upon this occasion, the 
course of sermons delivered in rotation by the ministers of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> in the new church in Brattle street, and 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> got nothing by the comparison. Dr. 
Blair, however, entertained us with an elegant and 
sublime discourse, in which, among other good things, 
he gave Tom Paine a hearty reprobation. 
</p><p>
I dined at Mr. O's. All well. I hope to receive a 
line to-day. A journal or diurnal register of farming 
would be very, very refreshing and entertaining. 
O ! the tedious solitude that awaits me for three or 
four months amidst the noise, smoke, wealth, luxury, 
eloquence, learning, wit and wisdom, of this proud 
city and our venerable Congress ! To me, one week 
of domestic felicity and rural amusement would be 
worth it all.
