My Dear Brother: I have not written you for some 
time as I knew you were so well occupied and hoped by 
this time you have attained the goal of your present 
movements, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=atlanta" rel="city">Atlanta</a>. We all feel that upon Grant and 
you, and the armies under your command, the fate of this 
country depends. If you are successful, it is ardently 
hoped that peace may soon follow with a restored union. 
If you fail, the wisest .can hope for nothing but a long 
train of disasters and the strife of factious. All our 
people cling to the hope of success, and seem perfectly 
willing to submit to taxation, bad administration, and 
every ill short of disunion. Whether it is the result of 
education, the constant warnings of the early Southern 
statesman, or the reason of the thing, everybody here 
dreads the breaking up of the union as the beginning of 
anarchy. The very thing they fight for in the South is 
for them, and for us, the worst calamity. What can be 
more terrible than the fate of Kentucky and Missouri. 
A man cannot go to bed at night, except in fear of the 
knife and torch. This lawlessness will extend all over 
the country if we do not have military success. All the 
clamor the Copperheads can make about/ personal liberty 
doesn't affect the people, if they can /only see security 
and success. Bad precedents in time of war will easily 
be corrected by peace. But the anarchy of unsuccessful 
war will reduce us to a pitiable state, in which we shall 
easily fall victims to demagogism or tyranny. Every 
one feels that you have done your part nobly. Grant 
has not had such success. No doubt he has done as well 
as any one could with his resources and such adversaries. 
Still he has not taken Richmond, and I fear will not this 
campaign. . . . 
</p><p>
I congratulate you on the ability and success of your 
campaign. I see many officers, and they all speak of it, 
not only as a success but as a scientific success, evincing 
abilities of a high order. I found on a short visit to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a> that you were very popular there. I saw 
Anderson, Swords, Dunn, and a host of others, all of 
whom entertained great kindness for you. . . . 
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
