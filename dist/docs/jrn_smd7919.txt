Monday Dr. Woods and Mr. Van Ingen stopped, 
just from their regiment in Kentucky and on their 
way home, and I begged so hard to see the Doctor, 
and promised so faithfully to retire if I suffered too 
much, that Mrs. Badger yielded, like an angel, and 
I carried my point. The Doctor! We looked in vain 
at each other; I for my dandy friend in irreproachable broadcloth, immaculate shirt bosoms and perfect boots; he for the brusque, impulsive girl who 
in ordinary circumstances would have run dancing 
into the parlor, would have given him half-glad, half-indifferent greeting, and then found either occasion 
to laugh at him or would have turned elsewhere for 
amusement. We looked, I say, in vain. Before me 
stood my pattern of neatness in a rough uniform of 
brown homespun. A dark flannel shirt replaced the 
snowy cambric one, and there was neither cravat nor 
collar to mark the boundary line between his dark 
face and the still darker material. And the dear 
little boots! O ye gods and little fishes! they were 
clumsy, and mud-spattered! If my mouth twitched 
with laughter as I silently commented, the Doctor's 
did not! I, who always danced on my way, came in 
lying back on my pillows, and wheeled in by a servant. The Doctor's sympathy was really touching, 
and poor consolation he gave when he heard the story. "You will recover, to a certain extent; but 
will feel it more or less all your life."

I am the ruin of all these puns; the gentlemen will 
hate me; I must learn to ignore their conundrums 
until they answer them themselves, and to wait 
patiently for the pun instead of catching it and 
laughing before it is half-spoken. Why can't I do 
as the others do? There was Mr. Van Ingen with 
his constant stream of them, that I anticipated 
several times. He said to me, "HI were asked what 
town in Louisiana I would rather be in this evening, 
what would my answer be?" I should have looked 
perfectly innocent, and politely inquisitive; but I 
did neither. I saw the answer instantly, and 
laughed. "Ah, you have guessed! I can see it in 
your eyes!" he said. Of course I had, but I told him 
I was afraid to say it, for fear he might think I was 
flattering myself. Then we both laughed. The 
place he referred to was Bayou, Sarah. . . .

Yesterday, being a beautiful day, I was carried down in honor of Christmas, to meet Captain Fenner 
and Mr. Duggan who were to dine with us. The cars had brought Miriam a beautiful little set of collars 
and cuffs from Dellie, and the oddest, sweetest little set for me, from Morgan, for our Christmas gift. It is all Lilly. . . . 
</p><p>
We had an exquisite Christmas gift the night 
before, a magnificent serenade, a compliment from 
Colonel Breaux. It very singularly happened that 
Miriam, Anna, and Ned Badger were sitting up in 
the parlor, watching alone for Christmas, when the 
band burst forth at the steps, and startled them into 
a stampede upstairs. But Gibbes, who came with 
the serenaders, caught them and brought them 
back into the parlor, where there were only eight 
gentlemen ; and in this novel, unheard-of style, only 
these two girls, with Gibbes to play propriety, entertained all these people at midnight while the band 
played without. . . .

I commenced writing to-day expressly to speak 
of our pleasant Christmas; yet it seems as though 
I would write about anything except that, since I 
have not come to it yet. Perhaps it is because I feel 
I could not do it justice. At least, I can say who 
was there. At sunset came Captain Bradford and 
Mr. Conn, the first stalking in with all the assurance 
which a handsome face and fine person can lend, the 
second following with all the timidity of a first 
appearance. . . . Again, after a long pause, the door 
swung open, and enter Mr. Halsey, who bows and 
takes the seat on the other side of me, and Mr. Bradford, of Colonel Allen memory, once more returned 
to his regiment, who laughs, shakes hands all around, 
and looks as happy as a schoolboy just come home 
for the holidays, who has never-ending visions of plumcakes, puddings, and other sweet things. While 
all goes on merrily, another rap comes, and enter Santa Claus, dressed in the old uniform of the Mexican War, with a tremendous cocked hat, and preposterous beard of false hair, which effectually conceal the face, and but for the mass of tangled short 
curls no one could guess that the individual was Bud. It was a device of the General's, which took 
us all by surprise. Santa Claus passes slowly around the circle, and pausing before each lady, draws from 
his basket a cake which he presents with a bow, while to each gentleman he presents a wineglass 
replenished from a most suspicious-looking black bottle which also reposes there. Leaving us all 
wonder and laughter, Santa Claus retires with a basket much lighter than it had been at his entrance. . . . Then follow refreshments, and more and more talk and laughter, until the clock strikes 
twelve, when all these ghosts bid a hearty good night and retire.
