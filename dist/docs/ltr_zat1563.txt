My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your two lengthy & interesting letters of the 2o th & 24th  ult ac 
companied by a number of extracts cut from various n. papers on the 
subject of my letter to Majr Gen Gaines, written last fall which alth not 
intended for publication, he though proper to turn it over to some one 
who had it published, in the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">N. York</a> Express, without my consent, 
which would not have been given had I been consulted, but as it has 
been done there is now no recalling it, & of course I will leave the propriety to be discussed as regards my agency in the matter, as well as my 
culpability or otherwise in the transaction ; as well as the attacks made on 
me by order, in congress about the capitulation of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>, for all of 
which you have my sincere thanks. The various assaults give me but 
little concern, alth it has brought on me a reprimand from the president, 
in addition to a sharpt one from the Secretary of War, about the impropriety of writing the letter in question, blowing me as he supposed up 
with impunity, which he would hardly have ventured to have done to the 
extent he carried it, had he not supposed that by striping me of the 
greater portion of my com d that I was powerless & therefore dare not 
defend myself against his attacks which have been carried on under cover 
against me for the last five months or more ; but he will find himself 
somewhat mistaken, & I have no doubt when he gets my reply to his 
abusive & contemptable letter, he will regret the course he has pursued. 
I observe great hopes are entertained by the party in power, that my 
correspondence about transportation &c will not bear the light, & when 
ever published will break me down ; but I say let them give it to the 
public without garbling, & I shall have nothing to fear or regret. 
</p><p>
I am satisfied that Scott, Marcy & Co. have been more anxious to 
break me down, than they have been to break down Santa Anna, & the 
Mexicans, for never was an officer left so completely bound hand & foot 
under all the circumstances of the case, at the mercy of the enemy, after 
the most uncourteous, & I may say insulting course having been pursued 
toward me, by the party referred to ; but through the blessings of divine 
providence I have disappointed their expectations if not defeated their 
nefarious schemes ; & feel proud however in knowing that by pursuing 
the course I did, that I saved the honor of the country, & our glorious 
flag from trailing in the dust ; had I left the country as many of my 
warmest friends advised me to have at once done on the rec 1 of Scotts 
outrageous order at Victoria, there would not at this moment have been 
any portion of the country on this side the Rio Grande in our posses 
sion, except <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoros" rel="city">Matamoros</a>. This & every other place above that, must 
have been abandoned or the garrison have fallen into the hands of the 
enemy ;~had I left at the time referred to the battle of Buena Vista never 
would have been fought ; & had that not been fought & won, Santa 
Anna would have swept the whole country we had conquered in this portion of Mexico. If Scott had left me five hundred or one thousand 
regular Infr the Mexican army would have been completely broken 
down, & the whole of their artillery & baggage taken or destroyed ; as it 
was we were barely able to maintain ourselves. The volunteers behaved 
nobly which the number of their killed & wounded will bear witness to. 
How the country will act on the occasion time must determine, but it 
seems to me that the friends of those who fell on that occasion should 
hold meetings in the several states & call on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">the President</a> to remove 
Marcy from his present position as being entirely incompetent to the 
situation ; as well as to send Scott back to Washington but it is possible 
things may be so artfully managed as to bring popular opinion to bear 
on me for not killing or capturing Santa Anna & the whole of his army. 
I think Finlay was overly anxious to get back to his family, & it 
seems to me it would have been much more creditable to him had he 
remained & gone on duty at some post where he could have been sta 
tionary for a time at least ; but he was constantly complaining of ill 
health so much so as to incapacitate him for duty ; so I thought it as 
well to permit him at once to leave. I understand that Jarvis & Turner 
have both so managed matters with or through Col Curtis then in com d at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a> to get sent out of the country with despatches the first to 
Washington to let the dep t know the perilous situation the army under 
my com d was in & the latter to apprise them of the repulse of the enemy 
at Buena Vista. So it seems that the medical dep c appear to be peculiarly 
fitted for carrying expresses. As I learn the Surg n Gen come out in the 
steamer <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York" rel="city">N. York</a> I hope you had an interview with him, & arranged 
matters to your satisfaction ; if not that you are prepared to leave, on 
the leave of absence which you must have rec d from my h d quarters, ere 
now. As Jarvis & Turner have left the country the only alternative 
will be for you to hire a citizen surgeon to relieve you. I left Saltillo 
on the 8th  & arrived here on the 9th & found the communications between this & <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a> entirely cut off which is not yet entirely restored 
as the enemy are carrying on an active war against our wagon trains & 
expresses some of which have been cut off & destroyed, so many as to 
have caused a great panic among the volunteers or many of them, so that 
large escorts must accompany every train & even then they have not succeeded in getting through in safety ; but I hope as soon as some two or 
three of the new regt 8 arrive security as well as confidence will be given 
& restored to persons & property passing the Rio Grande & this place.

The remarks of Scott to Waggaman that he supposed I had a 
larger force of regulars, than was the case, & that he did not intend to 
have so completely striped me of that description of force, is untrue, as 
he had the monthly returns before him, which were regularly made out, 
& transmitted for his as well as for the information of others to the 
adj 1 Gen of the army. I rec d a letter from Betty who with Dick was in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a>, dated the 2O th ult in which she says all were well in Baton 
Rouge a few days before she wrote ; also that she would return home in 
a day or two. 
</p><p>
Unless you are fortunate enough to see Lawson at Brasos, you can 
hardly expect to do so in Washington even admitting you have to go 
East, as I presume he will hardly leave the army he is now with before 
the close of the campaign ; Betty speaks of meeting him in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a>. 
I have no idea that John will succeed in getting an appointment ; his 
relationship to me forbids any such expectation. I regret to hear of Col 
Taylors bad spirits, & have written him but once since the battle of 
Buena Vista, & then very briefly merely informing him of my safety, & 
the result, for two reasons, one that I looked for him here as he stated 
he would leave <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoros" rel="city">Matamoros</a> for this place as soon as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> left 
Brasos Island, and secondly I can hard find time to write a sintence for 
morning to night without interruption from some one, so much so as 
frequently almost to come to the determination to give up except to my 
family all private correspondence ; for I frequently am at a loss to know, 
where I left off, or where to commence a sentence. I yet hope from the 
feelings which are now manifested toward me by the authorities in Washington, in conjunction with some letters I have addressed to the Secy of 
War, that I would be recalled or superseded in the com d in a few weeks 
which will afford me the opportunity to return to Louisean, which by no 
means will be an unacceptable arrangement ; & I truly hope my expectations may be realized. The attacks in the papers give me no concern 
nor shall I notice any of them, but continue to pursue the " even tenor 
of my way " without turning to the right or left to pleas any one. It 
would afford me much real pleasure to learn that you had been assigned 
to a desirable station somewhere ; but should you fail in this & find 
affairs to take such a course as in your opinion to make it necessary for 
you to leave the service, look well to it before doing so, so that you may 
not hereafter have cause to regret it. My love to dear Ann & the 
children when you see or write them, as it is possible you may leave 
before this reaches Fort Polk if so I presume as a matter of course, you 
will leave directions for your letters to be forwarded ; also my love to 
Bob, & wishing you & yours continued health happiness & prosperity 
I remain truly your 
</p><p>
