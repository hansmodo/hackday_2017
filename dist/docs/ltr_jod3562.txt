MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
I HAVE been so diligent on the road, and so much interrupted by company at the taverns, that this is the 
first time I have been able to get an opportunity to 
write to you. We arrived at this house last night 
(Saturday), shall rest here to-day, and go into New 
York to-morrow. At <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, the manufacturers 
presented me with a piece of broadcloth for a suit of 
clothes. At New Haven, the corporation presented 
me with the freedom of the city. At both these towns 
the gentlemen came out to meet us, and went out 
with us. At Horseneck, we were met by Major Pintard and Captain Mandeville, with a party of horse 
from the State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and there is to be much parade on Monday. Before this, I presume the 
printers in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> have inserted in their gazettes the 
debates of the House of Representatives, which are 
conducted with open galleries. This measure, by 
making the debates public, will establish the national 
government or break the confederation. I can conceive of no medium between these extremes. By the 
specimens that I have seen, they go on with great 
spirit in preparing the impost, which is a favorable 
omen.

My love to the children, and duty to my mother, &c.
