GENERAL MONTGOMERY TO MAJOR PRESTON.

SIR, 
</p><p>
The advanced season of the year will not admit of your proposal. I do assure you, upon the honor of a gentleman, that 
what the prisoner has informed you of is true, as far as has 
come to my knowledge. However, if it wants further confirmation, Mr. Depane, of <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, who is also my prisoner, will, I 
believe, give you the same intelligence. 
</p><p>
Having now acquitted my conscience, I must, to save time 
and prevent trouble, acquaint you, if you do not surrender this 
day, it will be unnecessary to make any future proposals. The garrison shall be prisoners of war without the honors of 
and I cannot insure the officers their baggage. Should you wish 
to send an officer to Mr. Depane, who is on board the sloop, you 
have my permission. Captain Stewart carries an order for that 
purpose. Should you still be inclined to persist in a useless 
defence, you will immediately fire a cannon without shot, as a 
signal. I am, &c., 
</p><p>
