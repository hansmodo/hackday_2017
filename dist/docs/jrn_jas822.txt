Doctor Marsh sent an Express with information of Fremonts Difficulties with Castro. Capt. Fremont was blockaded near Monterey by Castro and his Troopes, and refused him to proceed to the South through the Country on the Coste, etc. The foreign Residents wanted to assist Fremont, but he refused their aid.
