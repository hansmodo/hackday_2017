Sir, 
</p><p>
I imagine your Excellency has been informed that, 
in consequence of the resolution of Congress for 
granting commissions to Aids-de-camp appointed under the former establishment, I have obtained one of 
Lieutenant-Colonel in the army of the United States, 
bearing rank since the 1st of March <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 
</p><p>
It is become necessary to me to apply to your 
Excellency to know in what manner j'-ou foresee you 
will be able to employ me in the ensuing campaign. 
I am ready to enter into activity whenever you 
think proper, though I am not anxious to do it till 
the army take the field, as, before that period, I perceive no object. Unconnected as I am with any regiment, I can have no other command than in a 
light corps, and I flatter myself my pretensions to 
this are good. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency knows I have been in actual service since the beginning of <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. I began in the 
line; and had I continued there, I ought, in justice, to 
have been more advanced in rank than I now am. 
I believe my conduct, in the different capacities in 
which I have acted, has appeared to the officers of 
the army in general such as to merit their confidence 
and esteem; and I cannot suppose them to be so ungenerous as not to see me with pleasure put into a 
situation still to exercise the disposition I have always had of being useful to the United States. 
</p><p>
I mention these things only to show that I do not 
apprehend the same difficulties can exist in my case 
(which is peculiar), that have opposed the appointment to commands, of some other officers not belono-ing to what is called the line. Though the light 
infantry is chiefly formed, yet being detached to the 
southward, I take it for granted there will be a vanguard by detachment formed for this army. I have 
the honor to be, very respectfully, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
