You will be astonished, my dear father, at the news I am on the point of giving you: it has cost me far more than I can express not to
consult you. My respect and affection for you, as well as my great confidence in you, must convince you of the truth of this assertion;
but my word was given, and you would not have esteemed me had I broken it; the step I am now taking will at least prove to you, I hope, the
goodness of my intentions. I have found a peculiar opportunity of distinguishing myself, and of learning a soldier's trade: I am a
general officer in the army of the United States of America. The frankness of my conduct, and my zeal in their service, have completely
won their confidence. I have done, on my side, all I could do for them, and their interest will ever be dearer to me than my own. In short, my
dear father, I am at this moment in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, anxiously awaiting letters from my friends; upon receiving them, I shall set off from hence, and,
without stopping at Paris, I shall embark in a vessel that I have myself purchased and chartered. My travelling companions are the Baron de Kalb, 
a very distinguished officer, brigadier in the King's service, and major-general, as well as myself, in the United States' army; and
some other excellent officers, who have kindly consented to share the chances of my fate. I rejoice at having found such a glorious
opportunity of occupying myself, and of acquiring knowledge. I am conscious that I am making an immense sacrifice, and that to quit my
family, my friends, and you, my dearest father, costs me more than it could do any other person,--because I love you all far more tenderly
than any other person ever loved his friends. But this voyage will not be a very long one; we see every day far longer journeys taken for
amusement only; and I hope also to return more worthy of all those who are kind enough to regret my absence. Adieu, my dear father, I hope I
shall soon see you again. Retain your affection for me; I ardently desire to merit it--nay, I do merit it already, from my warm affection
towards you, and from the respect that, during the remainder of his life, will be felt for you by,
</p><p>
Your affectionate son,
</p><p>

I have arrived, for one moment, at Paris, my dear father, and have only time to bid you again farewell. I intended writing to my uncle
and to Madame de Lusignem, but I am in such haste that I must request you to present to them my respectful regards.
