Dear Brother : I have kept the general run of you during your trip, and therefore know what a fine reception 
you had on the coast. 
</p><p>
It is a fatiguing trip, and no wonder that Lizzie is 
worn out by it. I have spent the summer very quietly 
and pleasantly, most of the time at home. I did my 
share of the work in the canvas at Ohio and Indiana, but 
it was a languid one. I am getting tired of the ceaseless 
struggle of political life, and above all dread the contest 
next summer, when, if I am a candidate, I shall have to 
encounter the combined opposition of every Democrat 
and of every Federal office-holder in Ohio. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately, 
</p><p>
