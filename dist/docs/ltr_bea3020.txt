Camp, before <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city origin'>Quebec</a>, <a rel="day origin" value="12">12</a> <a rel="month origin" value="1">January</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776" rel="origin">1776</a>. 
GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
Since writing the inclosed, <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague met'>General Wooster</a> has acquainted me 
he cannot leave <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, but has sent down Colonel Clinton, to 
whom I shall resign the command, until my wound will permit my 
doing duty, which my surgeon thinks will be four or six weeks. 
Colonel Clinton acquaints me we cannot expect more than two 
hundred men from <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. I have put on foot the raising a 
regiment of three or four hundred Canadians, which I make no 
doubt of effecting. They are to have the same pay and to be 
under the same regulations as the Continental forces. I make 
no doubt the exigency of our affairs will justify the step I have 
taken (though without authority for so doing), and that it will 
be approved of by the Honorable Continental Congress. I am, 
&c., <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>.
