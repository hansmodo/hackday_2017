MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have been near a fortnight before <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, at the head of upwards of eight hundred men ; a force, you will say, not very 
adequate to the business in hand. But we must make the best of it. It is all I could get. I have been so used to struggle with difficulties, that I expect them of course. 
</p><p>
I hope the troops will be sent down as soon as possible, for 
should we fail in our first attempt, a second or a third may do 
the business, before relief can arrive to the garrison. Possession 
of the town, and that speedily, I hold of the highest consequence. 
The enemy are expending the ammunition most liberally ; and I 
fear the Canadians will not relish a union with the Colonies, till 
they see the whole country in our hands, and defended by such 
a force as may relieve them from the apprehensions of again 
falling under the ministerial lash. Were it not for these reasons, 
I should have been inclined to a blockade, till towards the first 
of April, by which time the garrison would probably be much 
distressed for provisions and wood. 
</p><p>
With anxious wishes for the recovery of your health, and best 
respects to your family, if you be returned home, I am, my 
dear Sir, your very affectionate and obliged, humble servant, 
</p><p>
