Dear Brother : . . . Belknap has acted badly by me 
ever since he reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. . . . 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> promised me often to arrange and 
divide our functions, but he never did, but left the 
Secretary to do all those things of which he himself, as 
General, had complained to Stanton. I don't think I 
ever used the expression often imputed to me of saying 
that the Secretary of War is only a clerk to the President. It is the opinion of many lawyers that the Secretary of War himself has no right to issue a military 
order to officers and soldiers that his office is civil 
etc., etc. The President is constitutional commanderin-chief, and when the Secretary issues his order he 
ought to recite the fact; whereas orders are issued by 
the Adjutant-General by order of the Secretary of War. 
This is done daily, and I cannot command unless orders 
come through me, which they do not, but go straight to 
the party concerned. This is the real question at issue 
between us. Congress ought to clearly define the relation between the Secretary of War and a General of the 
army. It is not the case now, but the Secretary of 
War exercises all the functions of the CommanderGeneral under a decision of the Attorney-General. . . .

Yours, etc.,
