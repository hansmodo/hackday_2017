My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your several letters of the 29 th ult & 4th ins have just reached me 
with your correspondence with Majr J. which agreeable to your wishes 
was destroyed as soon as read ; the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a> Journals &c came to hand 
at the same time for all of which accept my best thanks 
</p><p>
It was truly gratifying to me to learn that you Ann & the children, 
as well as Mrs Taylor & Betty continued to enjoy good health, which I 
sincerely hope will continue to be the case ; as they have I suppose ere 
now all reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Pascagoula" rel="city">Pascagoula</a>, I feel pretty easy as regards their health, & 
other matters. I hope they will get on without difficulty, accidents or 
misfortunes of any kind or description. My greatest fears are for you, 
being apprehensive that yellow fever in a malignant form may be brought 
to the Barracks from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a>, as there must now be a great deal of 
intercours between the two places or it may originate in New Orleans, & 
extend to the Barracks, or even at the latter place ; all that I can say on 
the subject is, that I hope you will by great caution escape that & all other 
diseases 
</p><p>
I truly regretted to hear of the difficulty between you and the Majr 
of the 3 d Infy as I conceive it was unnecessary on your part to have any 
with him ; I look on him more as a child or an old woman than in any 
other light & while I would from self respect as well as respect for the 
service treat the Majr with the courtesy due to his rank, but nothing more, 
byond which my course towards him would be as th there was no such 
being in existance & those who were so weak & contempt as as to be 
governed & influenced by him ; nothing short of his pulling my hair, or 
putting his fingers in my eyes would induce me to notice him. I do not 
feel dishonored by any airs his good lady may put on however ill they 
may become her, or can me or mine be honored by any attention from 
him or his The proper course is to let such people pass as if they 
were not in existance, or never would be

I was truly gratified to hear that Dick had so much improved in health, 
& with proper care hope he will very soon be entirely well. I am how 
ever very much vexed he should have passed through <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> without 
calling at the Barracks to see you his sister & the children, & offered his 
services to conduct them to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Pascagoula" rel="city">Pascagoula</a>, or any where else, Ann or the 
girls might have wished to have gone. In my last I mentioned that 
Mr Conrad had proposed accompaning Mrs T. & Betty across the Lake, 
& was pleased to learn from you that he had done so, as they could not 
have had a better escort & would saveyou the trouble of going over with 
them. I think it would have done better if Mrs T deferred her visit 
to about the middle of the present month, & remained to the middle of 
Nov r her return to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baton Rouge" rel="city">B. Rouge</a> ought to be regulated by the health at that place 
</p><p>
Finlay is in an unfortunate predicament & I do not regret his not 
coming here 
</p><p>
I feel much indebted to Gen Broke for his kindness to you and particularly so for his very kind offer to accompany Mr s Taylor & Betty 
across the Lake and beg you to offer him my thanks for the same ; at the 
same time I am gratified there was no necessity for his doing so 
</p><p>
Since I wrote you nothing has occurred here worth mentioning ; the 
last official information we had here from the other column was by the 
way of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a>, which was contained in the Picayune of the y th ins t 
I have put or ordered between two & three thousand troops to that line; 
unless negotiations are going on & even pretty well advanced, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> 
must be ere this in the City of Mexico, which if he can hold onto & keep 
his communications open with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Vera Cruz" rel="city">Vera Cruz</a>, & peace does not grow out of 
it, there is no telling when this unfortunate war will end ; should it not do 
so before the next meeting of Congress I hope the active operations will 
stopped, & we will take a line that we would accept by a treaty, occupy 
it, & withdraw our forces beyond it, acting entirely on the defensive with 
the exception of blocking their ports, if it is not deemed expedient to 
keep possession of them. I am glad you hear frequently from John & 
most truly & sincerely do I hope he may do well. Rob & the girls ought 
to be at school some where, but as to the proper place, I am unable to 
determine on 
</p><p>
I presume I may be considered pretty fairly committed for the presidency ; but will rejoice should some one else be taken up for said office, 
between now & holding the election for that office, as I would quit the 
field as candidate for the same, with as much pleasure as I would leave 
Mexico So far as I can judge I do not believe my Signal letter is calculated to do me much injury, & will like my letter to Gen Gaines, be a 
seven days wonder when it will be forgotten 
</p><p>
Please remember me most affectionately to Ann & the chidren when 
you write & wishing you all continued health happiness & prosperity I 
remain your Friend

Truly
