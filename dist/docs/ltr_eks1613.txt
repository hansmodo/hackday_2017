STEAMBOAT " ROUGH AND READY," 
JUST BELOW THE MOUTH OF THE SAN JUAN, 
January 22, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>. 
</p><p>
On the morning of the eighth we but little dreamed 
of being ordered to leave <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a>, where you have 
learned from my letters we were pleasantly quartered. 
I certainly was nearly domesticated in the family of 
Don Ramoon Flores. After dinner I had lain down 
upon my counter to take a siesta and had hardly Composed myself, when to my surprise my friend, Lieu 
tenant A of the Dragoons, roused me with the 
cry: " Up! you will be on the march in an hour." 
He had just arrived from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a> with dispatches 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a>, and though his lips were sealed 
by the General s orders, I heard enough to convince 
me we were to go to the coast. Major Staniford 
came to my quarters immediately after, briefly order 
ing before he put spurs to his horse: "Have your 
company ready to march in thirty minutes." Our 
preparations were soon made, and I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a> where 
I had been almost two months, with more regret than 
I should any other place where I have been in Mexico. 
The inhabitants had rapidly gained confidence in the 
regulars and were much alarmed when they found we 
were about leaving them to the mercy of the volunteers, of whom they have the utmost dread, and by 
whom they are generally treated with the utmost 
barbarity. I have kept a sort of diary since I left the 
city of fountains, and although it contains nothing 
of much interest, I will transcribe it for you. 
</p><p>
January g. Our regiment under Major Staniford 
left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a> about one in the afternoon, preceded by 
the artillery battalion under Brevet Lieutenant- 
Colonel Childs, which started at seven in the morning 
with Duncan s light artillery. Three companies of 
the Sixth Infantry were encamped five miles from 
town. We passed them and bivouacked after dark 
on a creek thirteen miles from the city. This stream 
with other rivulets rises in the springs around <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a> 
forming the head waters of the San Juan. The night 
was dark, the clouds threatened rain, which fell before 
morning in torrents, the first shower in two months. 
Many of the officers, relying on the uniform dryness 
of the weather, neglected to pitch their tents. I, how 
ever, believing that everything in Mexico is deceptive, 
pitched mine in which Lieutenants Rossell, Farelly, 
and myself spread our blankets, and would have slept 
comfortably if Butler s volunteers had not made so 
much noise that the poppy god took flight till after 
midnight. Reveille was beaten before four o clock, 
but at a still earlier hour the rain drove several of my 
brother officers to my tent for shelter, and their complaints and jokes broke my rest for the residue of the 
night. They were " dimnition, damp, cold, disagree 
able bodies," and my liquor case suffered a fearful 
diminution in warming up their shivering clay. 
</p><p>
January 10. At six, though still dark, we began 
our march and at ten in the morning reached the little 
village of Los Muertes. This small town which, when 
we passed before, was filled with smiling inhabitants, 
now presented a sad picture of the desolation produced 
by war. The people were all gone, not one left, driven 
off by the volunteers, the houses in ruins, the shade 
trees girdled or cut down, and the ground strewed by 
the carcasses of dead horses and mules. It was a dark, 
drizzling day and was altogether a sad, desolate scene. 
The little river was alone unchanged. Its clear waters 
rippled over their gravelly bed with the same cheerful 
sound. At half-past eleven we arrived at the famous 
pass of Los Muertes the dividing line between the 
Departments of Coahuilla and New Leon. At one 
we encamped at Riconada. Here two months ago 
was a beautiful village, but all is now as at Los Muertes 
marked by the desolating hand of war. It rained 
nearly all the afternoon but we had plenty of wood, 
a rare thing in Mexico, and our bright blazing camp 
fires soon made us all comparatively comfortable. 
The three companies of the Sixth overtook us here, 
and the artillery battalions are but a short distance 
in advance. I find my pony s back very sore, and 
shall be compelled to foot it tomorrow. . . . 
</p><p>
January n. Struck our tents and marched at 
six. It was a cold day, the ground frozen for ten 
miles. General Worth overtook us at twelve, and we 
encamped four miles from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> at three o clock, 
having marched a distance estimated at twenty- 
six miles. A very fatiguing day, most of the men 
footsore. The Second Dragoons passed us about 
five o clock. 
</p><p>
January 12. We were en route by break of day, 
preceded by the artillery battalion which we passed 
last evening. Our road was not only interesting from 
the sublime scenery on either hand, but it passed 
directly through the battle fields of the twenty-first, 
twenty-second, and twenty-third of September, leaving Fort Soldado which was carried by the Fifth at 
the point of the bayonet on our right, and the Bishop s 
palace in the storming of which they assisted on the 
left. As I marched over this ground on the flank of 
my company I was struck by the remarks of the old 
soldiers as they pointed out to the recruits the places 
where remarkable events had occurred during the 
battles. Passed through <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> and halted at 
Walnut Springs about eleven in the morning. Since 
we left for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a>, the burial places of those who fell 
at the storming of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> have been handsomely 
enclosed in walls of cut stone surrounding an area of a 
few rods. There are two of them, in one are the offi 
cers, in the other lie the bones of the enlisted men. 
Each has in the centre of the front wall a square 
column surmounted by a heavy cross. Here is also 
a cross at the head of each grave on which the name 
of the occupant is rudely carved. After a short halt 
at Walnut Springs we proceeded on our march and 
encamped near the village of San Francisco, having 
made thirteen miles. 
</p><p>
January ij. Crossed the San Juan two miles from 
Marina which town we passed at twelve noon, and 
encamped at a small stream, Agua Negra, the entire 
distance variously estimated from eighteen to twenty- 
two miles. The day was hot and much detention arose 
from bad places in the road at one of which the staff 
wagon was upset. 
</p><p>
January 14. Our march began at the usual hour, 
we passed Ramos and encamped before twelve noon 
on a small brook near Papa Gallos, having made but 
nine miles. We were halted thus early because we 
heard that the streams and springs were dry, so that 
the first water we shall find is twenty miles from this 
place. 
</p><p>
January 15. Marched two hours before sunrise. 
Twelve miles from our starting place we crossed the 
Arroyo Mujares (Woman s Creek) where two months 
since there was a fine spring and plenty of water, but 
we found it dry and toiled on six miles farther to 
Carrista before we found any good water. The weather 
oppressively hot, the road dusty and very rough. In 
the morning the Sixth Infantry overtook us and I 
was surprised to see Adam Miller, a drummer in one 
of the companies. I discharged him in June with 
more than two hundred dollars in his possession and 
started him for home (Rochester). He spent his 
money and re-enlisted, the fool ! We reached our 
camp at Cerralvo about four o clock, having marched 
twenty-five miles. . . . Cerralvo is a beautiful Mexican town on a clear swift stream which finds its source 
in some large springs about a mile distant. Near are 
some rich old silver mines which have not been worked 
recently. We, however, saw signs in the mountains 
which convinced us that the miners have begun their 
labors again. 
</p><p>
January 16. Left Cerralvo before sunrise, marched 
twelve miles to Punta Aguada, the headquarters of 
the famous Ranchero chief, Canales. The town contained several hundred inhabitants before the war, 
but they have all been driven off by the volunteers. 
It is situated on a small stream which is crossed 
at our encampment by a dam beautifully built of 
cut stone and Roman cement. The entire division 
encamps together tonight. 
</p><p>
January 17. Left camp at half -past five and were 
halted before twelve on the same stream at which we 
encamped last night, having marched sixteen miles. 
This stream at Punta Aguada is called Agua Largo 
and is the Alamo on which stands Mier, near its junction with the Rio Grande. Next day we marched 
through Mier and encamped five miles beyond on the 
banks of the Rio Grande. We heard today, January 
18, that we were to descend the river from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a> 
in boats and I hope it may prove true. Mier is the 
scene of the famous Texan battle, I believe the only 
one on record in which a victorious army surrendered 
to the vanquished, in the moment of success, which 
was actually the case on the occasion to which I 
allude. I have just taken a refreshing bath in the 
river and feel like a new man. I picked from the 
margin a beautiful little daisy in blossom. . . . Our 
encampment is near an extensive hacienda. When 
we passed before there were evidences of more virtue 
and comfort than is usual in a Mexican settlement. 
Now their houses and fences are broken, their cattle 
and flocks destroyed by the troops who have passed, 
and an old man has just told me that to complete 
their misery, the Comanches recently assailed them 
taking what little they had left, and carrying off some 
of their women and children into endless captivity. 
Before morning, January 19, we had a regular norther. 
The wind pierced us to the very marrow but notwith 
standing the weather our reveille was beaten at half- 
past two and we broke up our encampment and 
marched before five. The morning was as dark as 
possible, and how we got along over our wild path 
for more than an hour, I cannot tell, for actually a 
man couldn t see his file leader. We, however, 
stumbled along until after daybreak, blindly groping 
our way through the drifting sand. We reached 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a> about eleven in the morning and made our 
encampment on the barren, dusty plain amid the filth 
and dust of the old camping grounds. We have made 
a remarkable march. It will not be ten days until 
one o clock since we left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Saltillo" rel="city">Saltillo</a>, two hundred miles 
distant. Why has this rapid march been made ? is the 
question in every one s mouth. No one knows, but 
all believe that an army is rapidly concentrating at 
the mouth of the river, which with the troops at 
Tampico under <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">General Scott</a> are to attempt the 
capture of San Juan D Ulloa. Our camp is the most 
watched place imaginable, the storm continues unabated and the filthy debris of numerous previous 
camps ground to dust is whirling about us; it is really 
insupportable ! I wish I was " to hum." 
</p><p>
January 20 and 21 . We are still lying in camp wait 
ing for a boat to take us down the river. The last 
artillery battalion and Marcy s company of our regiment have embarked this evening. The talk is all of 
peace in camp this evening. It is said the Mexican 
Congress are disposed to accept our terms, and General 
Scott before he left said that if a peace was concluded, 
the Fifth would go back to their old Lake Stations. 
I place but little faith in any of it it promises too 
much happiness to be true. 
</p><p>
January 22. At reveille we found our boat, the 
" Rough and Ready," had arrived and we prepared 
to embark. At two in the afternoon we were paddling 
down stream all congratulating ourselves on our good 
quarters and on our escape from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a>, certainly 
the most filthy and disgusting place on this dirty 
earth. The twenty-third and twenty-fourth we still 
continued down the river with no incidents of importance, often bringing up with a terrible crash on a 
sand bar or bumping our nose in some short turn 
against the shore. This evening as usual we tied up 
at a wood yard where we remain until morning. 
There is an extensive hacienda at this place, and the 
young officers collected the Sefioras for a ball. The 
dance continued until eleven o clock. We reached 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a> January 25 about three o clock. . . . We 
are all anxious to hear what Congress are doing, 
hoping they will pass the bill for a " retired " list for 
" worn out " officers and that they will not pass the 
bill increasing the number of regiments, as a reduction must follow a peace. We are lying by, a few 
miles from the spot selected for our encampment, 
which is about forty miles by water from the mouth. 
The river is exceedingly crooked, in one place after 
having gone sixty miles you are only three miles from 
the starting point. The entire distance from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=camargo" rel="city">Camargo</a> 
to the mouth is estimated at four hundred and fifty 
miles by water, while by land it is less than two hundred. Tonight all doubt as to our destination is 
removed we are to go to Vera Cruz. 
</p><p>
January 26. I feel very much indisposed to write 
even the few lines required for my diary. An ugly 
norther is blowing and I am tired and sick, my tent 
is cold and it is half-past ten at night. If, however, 
I suffer myself to neglect my diary once, I should soon 
give it up entirely. We got up steam and ran down 
to our camping ground, landed at eight in the morn 
ing, and made our camp on the left of the Fourth 
Infantry, the artillery battalion on the extreme right 
and the Sixth and Eighth Infantry will encamp on 
our left when they arrive. We found a mail for us 
here. . . . We hear of the probable passage of several 
army bills, such as the Retired List, Extra Major, 
Increase by Ten Regiments, etc., and all are now 
speculating upon the promotions, but nothing can 
be determined until we see the laws. My friends here 
are of the opinion that both Marcy and myself will 
be brevetted. I will not, however, permit myself to 
form any expectations which may result in disappointment. We shall probably remain here some two 
or three weeks, and I trust shall hear something 
definite before we embark for our campaign at Vera 
Cruz. 
</p><p>
Our ground here is admirably adapted for an encampment. It is a plain on the United States side of 
the river, covered by a short close grass and there s 
an abundance of wood.
