</p><p>
Dear Brother: . . . We have several posts of the 
Grand Army here, one of which, Frank Blair Post Xo 1. 
invited me to assist in the dedication of their new hall. I 
could not well decline, and attended. The hall was well 
filled, but it is against the customs and rules for reporters 
to be present. I saw none, but there must have been two 
at least who reported what little I had to say differently. Still my speech was most imperfect and condensed, emphasizing what I said of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jed rel="adversary">Jeff. Davis</a>, and 
induced somewhat by the regular speaker of the evening, who preceded me. 
</p><p>
I congratulated them upon having secured so good a 
hall in so good a neighborhood; said that I was glad to 
see the interest manifested ; that it was well for old soldiers thus to meet to interchange the memories of the 
war, and to impress its lessons on the rising generation; 
that I noticed a tendency to gloss over the old names 
and facts; that it was not a "war among the States," a 
war of "secession," but a "conspiracy" up to the firing 
on Sumter, and a "Rebellion" afterwards; that, whilst 
in Louisiana long before <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=abl" rel="colleague met">Mr. Lincoln</a> was inaugurated, I saw evidences of the "conspiracy," among them 
the letter written in January by Slidell and Benjamin, 
then United States Senators under the oath, written 
on paper dated "United States Senate," etc., addressed 
to T. 0. Moore, Governor of Louisiana, to seize the 
United States Arsenal at Baton Kouge ; that afterwards, 
during the progress of the war, I had seen letters of 
Mr. Davis a chest full at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=jackson" rel="city">Jackson</a>, Miss., sent to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> proving such " conspiracy, " and subsequently I had seen a letter of Mr. Davis showing that 
he was not sincere in his doctrine of secession, for when 
some of the States of the Confederacy, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1865">1865</a>, talked 
of " separate State action," another name for " secession," 
he, as President of the Confederacy, would resist it, even 
if he had to turn <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel rel="">Lee</a>'s army against it. I did see such 
a letter, or its copy, in a captured letter-book at Ealeigh, 
just about as the war was closing. 
</p><p>
Mr. Davis, in a card addressed to the " Republican " 
of this city, published by it and generally copied, pronounced this false, calls on me to produce the identical 
letter, or to stand convicted of being a slanderer. Of 
course I cannot for an instant allow Mr. Davis to call 
on me for any specific document, or to enter up judgment on the statement of a newspaper. Still, I believe 
the truth of my statement can be established. I will 
not answer Mr. Davis direct, nor will I publish anything over my signature, but I will collect evidence to 
make good my statement. The particular letter shown 
me at Raleigh may be in the public archives at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, as I am sure that the box or chest was sent 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=jackson" rel="city">Jackson</a>, Miss. ; but I apprehend that the papers 
gathered at Fayetteville, Raleigh, and Chapel Hill University were of those taken in hand by my two adjutants, Generals Sawyer and Rochester, brought to St. 
Louis, assorted and arranged as part of the records of 
the "Division of the Missouri," and sent to Chicago at 
the time General Sheridan relieved me. These records 
were consumed in the great fire of Chicago, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1871">1871</a>, but of 
the existence of such a letter I have not a particle of 
doubt. Of course I cannot recall the words, but the 
general purport was such as to recall to my mind the old 
fable of the Farmer and the Ox: "It makes all the 
difference in the world whether your bull gores my ox 
or mine yours." 
</p><p>
I have made some inquiries of Col. R. N. Scott, in 
charge of the Rebellion Records, Union and Confederate, 
and if the correspondence between Mr. Davis and the 
State Governors is among these records, Mr. Davis will 
have his letter. I am not the custodian of the records 
of the war, which fill many buildings in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. 
As to Davis' opinions at that date, January and February, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1865">1865</a>, I can, I think, obtain secondary proof, being 
promised an original letter from Thad. Stevens 1 to 
Herschel V. Johnson, captured and still retained by a 
sergeant in the Union Army. 
</p><p>
As to the "conspiracy," the proof is overwhelming. 
As to Davis' opinions in the winter of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1864">1864</a>-65, I am 
equally satisfied, but may not be able to prove by his 
own handwriting. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
