SIR : As a letter from me, after so long a suspension of our correspondence, will probably be as little welcome 
as expected, I anticipate, on inditing it, only such attention on your part to its object as your reflections may 
deem consonant to your interest. I proceed accordingly, without further preamble, to apprise you, that having 
long since despaired of all indemnity from <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Mr. Burr</a> for 
my losses, by the confederacy in which I was associated with you and him, I count upon a partial reimbursement 
from you upon grounds and motives which it is the object of this letter to develop and recall to your recollection. Having mentioned <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Mr. Burr</a>, I wish you, sir, to observe, that I shall never more consider a reference to 
his honor, good faith, or resources in any other light than as a scandal to any man offering it who is not already 
sunk as low as himself. You will therefore feel, I hope, as little disposed to speak, at this day, of his intentions 
as of his means to indemnify his friends. It is on you, sir, that as regards myself, devolves this duty. The 
heroic offer you made to co-operate with your person and fortune in our common enterprise, gave you, in my estimation, a color of claim to that succession in empire you 
boasted you would win by better titles your deeds of merit in council or the field. For examples of these 
exploits, I anxiously invoked the season of their achievement; but I confess, sir, I attached a more interesting 
value to the tender you so nobly pledged of your whole property to forward and support our expedition, together 
with your special assurances to me of reimbursement for all contingent losses of a pecuniary nature I might individually suffer. These considerations, sir, as they involved me on your responsibility, naturally refer me to you for the acquittal of it, and possessing such ample 
powers to discharge it, I flatter myself I shall be able to induce you to the full exercise of them. To this end I 
now apprise you, that the period has arrived in which I feel myself warranted to tell you, that in virtue of your 
oral and written assurances to guarantee me against all injuries to my property by reason of my participation 
in the confederacy of <a href="/results.php?year=1806">1806</a>, I finally determined to embark with you, and have thereby sustained damage to the amount of $50,000, of which sum I now demand $15,000, 
payable at New Orleans or <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, in August next. 
The respective sums you have paid already in part discharge of your written obligation, I believe, $12,500, 
together with the $15,000 now required, will leave a balance of $22,500, which you may, if you please, adjust 
by your obligation, on receipt of which, if required, I will dismiss my demand against <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Mr. Burr</a> by suit in <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
Here, sir, you perceive is a demand instituted on the guarantee of the good faith of a gentleman, who can 
never plead specially thereto but out of a court of honor. Within that jurisdiction, he must acquiesce or rely on the 
general issue. Your adjusting this affair in the manner proposed, I would, at a certain period of our acquaintance, have suffered no man to question ; but the cruel, cold-blooded indifference with which you have so many 
years beheld a distressed family, in vain endeavoring to collect some fragment of the property embarked and 
wrecked in the voyage you had insured, without acquitting the debt of your guarantee such a demeanor, sir, 
naturally obliges me, as a further and final result of all my labors and deliberations that relate to you to submit 
to your reflections, other motives of action besides those already offered. These are certainly of a character and 
complexion I regret it should be my lot to exhibit to the public. To you, however, it belongs to say whether they 
shall remain shrouded within the sanctuary of your own breast, or stalk forth the heralds of the private treason and public perjury they will proclaim infallibly to the honest Democratic electors of South Carolina, who would thence remove you from the chair of their assembly with 
a different kind of zeal from that through which they placed you in it. Yes, sir, I submit it to your discretion, 
to keep concealed from your friends and from your country that led you to take part in our confederacy, which 
you pledged yourself to me to back with all your property, worth, as you stated, 200,000 guineas, to join and 
support us at !N~ew Orleans, at the head of 2,000 to 3,000 men, to leave with me, besides your oral and written guarantee of indemnity for all my losses, a private cipher, the inscrutable vehicle of our correspondence ; afterward, to commit the shabby treason of deserting from your parent by affinity, and your sovereign in expectancy ; 
and then, finally, in your -letters to your Governor, to vilify your father-in-law, and perpetrate an open perjury 
by publicly denying all privity or connection with his views or projects. Assuredly, sir, a picture of this kind, 
on which I have occasionally worked during the last four years, can not, you must imagine, be viewed by your 
Democratic friends with less horror than a death's head in a phantasmagoria ; and yet, after all my labors, I feel 
no wish to exhibit it to vindicate my character in associating with <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Mr. Burr</a> and yourself in the judgment of the mobility of the low people, or to appease the impotent 
vindictiveness of <a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel="">Mr. Jefferson</a> and his miserable partisans. The fact is, I have survived all the labors of body 
and mind imposed upon me by the evil genius of<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel=""> Jefferson</a> and of <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague kin">Burr</a>, except the remaining one of exposing both. 
</p><p>
But I must bequeath to my children and friends a memorial of that honor, loyalty and courage, to which 
you and I made our first offerings on entering into the association, but which you did not follow with me in 
the expedition ; such a remembrance, containing sketches of <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Mr. Burr</a>'s cabinet and correspondence with myself and other associates ; the history of my interviews and consultations with <a href="/results.php?tla=joa" rel="">Mr. Alston</a>, relative to <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Mr. Burr's</a> designs upon "New Orleans and Mexico, with ample 
references to letters and other rare and original documents, that will be lodged in Charleston or <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, for the inspection of the curious, the whole, sir, is now ready for the press, but shall not be sent away for publication until you shall have failed to announce your compliance with the engagements of honor herein required of you, by forwarding a credit for $15,000, payable as 
before mentioned, and accompanied with your obligation, or some other equivalent proposal, for adjusting the 
balance. Now, sir, to conclude, you may gather from what you have read, that I hold myself bound by no 
obligations of secrecy to any one who has broken faith with me, provided the disclosure work no injury to an innocent third person. That you may have full notice, I 
have no objection, in apprising you of the nature and design of the proposed publication ; but to give you an 
opportunity of keeping it out of view, by discharging the debt of honor you have contracted, whereby, in doing an act of justice, you will prevent the necessity of my 
selling to the public that detail of infamy and falsehood which you should exclusively purchase; that your past 
experience of my principles and temper will guarantee the sincerity of these sentiments, and to exemplify this 
assurance, I promise you, that whether the demand I have made upon you be complied with or not, I will, at any 
time after publishing my book, which shall be suppressed or expedited by your determination, promptly attend to 
any call you may think proper to make upon me. 
</p><p>
I have to add, that I have no doubt of my book's producing $10,000, if you do not think proper to prevent 
its appearance. Should you decide in the negative, you may rest assured I shall not, to save the trouble of smelt 
ing, abandon the ore I have extracted, with such expense of time and labor from the mines, both dark and deep, 
not, indeed, of Mexico, but of <a href="/results.php?tla=joa" rel="">Alston</a>,<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel=""> Jefferson</a> and <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Burr</a>. 
I send, besides the original, a duplicate and triplicate of this letter; namely, one directed to Columbia, one to 
Charleston, and the third to Georgetown. This is done with a view, by lessening the chances of my letters' miscarrying, to expedite your answer, for which I shall wait 
double the time necessary to bring it to me in the regular course of the mails. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your most obedient servant,
