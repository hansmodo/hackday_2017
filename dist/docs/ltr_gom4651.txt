Sir, 
</p><p>
Many complaints have reached me respecting the outrages 
committed against American vessels, by the French privateers. 
I have taken no notice of it to you, Sir, until now, in the hope 
that such examples would not multiply ; and I have replied to 
many letters on this subject, which were addressed to me by 
our Minister Plenipotentiary at London, in a way to tranquillize 
the fears, with which the enemies of the French nation endeavored to inspire my countrymen. But it appears to me of the 
utmost importance to prevent, as speedily as possible, such violations of the law of nations and of treaties. 
</p><p>
I have already been informed of the capture of the ship 
Aurora, of Baltimore, by the privateer Patriot, of Marseilles ; 
of the brig Bacchus, also of Baltimore, by a privateer of Cette ; 
and of the ship Laurens, of Charleston, by the privateer Sans 
Culotte, of Honfleur. I will spare you, Sir, the melancholy 
recital of the violence committed on these different occasions; 
and which was the less excusable, as it was done after possession had been taken, and when no resistance was made. But 
I earnestly entreat you to give the necessary orders, that for 
the future these illegal acts, whose unhappy consequences are 
incalculable, may not be permitted. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty to recall to your mind on this point, the 
provisions of the fifteenth article of the treaty of commerce and 
amity between France and the United States of America, 
which was concluded at Paris, on the 6th of February, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 
Your justice, as well as your good sense, Sir, warrant me in 
the belief, that you will labor effectively to preserve the union 
between France and the United States ; a union, which will, I 
hope, subsist forever, and become more and more a common 
bond of prosperity and happiness. I have the honor to be, &c.
