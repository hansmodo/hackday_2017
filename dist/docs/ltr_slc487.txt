                      To W. D. Howells, in Boston:
</p><p>
Xmas Eve, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1880">1880</a>.
</p><p>
MY DEAR HOWELLS,
</p><p>
--I was prodigiously delighted with what you said about the book--so, on the whole, I've concluded to publish intrepidly, instead
of concealing the authorship.  I shall leave out that bull story.
</p><p>
I wish you had gone to New York.  The company was small, and we had a
first-rate time.  Smith's an enjoyable fellow.  I liked Barrett, too.
And the oysters were as good as the rest of the company.  It was worth
going there to learn how to cook them.
</p><p>
Next day I attended to business--which was, to introduce Twichell to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Gen. Grant</a> and procure a private talk in the interest of the Chinese
Educational Mission here in the U. S.  Well, it was very funny.  Joe had
been sitting up nights building facts and arguments together into a
mighty and unassailable array and had studied them out and got them by
heart--all with the trembling half-hearted hope of getting Grant to add
his signature to a sort of petition to the Viceroy of China; but Grant
took in the whole situation in a jiffy, and before Joe had more than
fairly got started, the old man said: "I'll write the Viceroy a Letter
--a separate letter--and bring strong reasons to bear upon him; I know
him well, and what I say will have weight with him; I will attend to it
right away.  No, no thanks--I shall be glad to do it--it will be a labor
of love."
</p><p>
So all Joe's laborious hours were for naught!  It was as if he had come
to borrow a dollar, and been offered a thousand before he could unfold
his case....
</p><p>
But it's getting dark.  Merry Christmas to all of you.
</p><p>
                                   Yrs Ever,
</p>
                                             MARK.
