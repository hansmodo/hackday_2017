My dear Richard, 
</p><p>
Your acceptable & interesting letter of 2y th ult has this moment 
reached me, communicating the proceedings of the independent convention of Maryland, which had recently met in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> & adjourned for 
the purpose of taking into consideration my course in regard to the one 
pursued by the delegates from Louisiana in the Whig National Convention which assembled in June last ; that they should or a majority of them 
have on " sober second thoughts," been dissatisfied with my letter of 
explanation submitted to that body, by the committee who was authorised to address me touching the subject in question, is a matter to me of 
some regret as there are among them men whose good opinion I should 
like to possess ; but as to their supporting me for the highest office in the 
gift of the people, or not, it gives me but little concern ; I am satisfied 
with the course I have pursued since my name was first brought before 
the country as a candidate for the presidency, except in one instance which 
is, that I had not objected most positively to my name being at all con 
nected with the same; for in truth I never had any aspiration for the 
office; nor have I any wishes for it now, further than my friends are 
anxious for me to reach it & trust those who are not satisfied with the 
course as regards the action of the Louisiana Delegation in the matter in 
question as well as the course I have pursued in the matter of consistency 
or the position I have taken & now occupy since my nomination by the 
convention at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> will not hesitate to cast their votes for some 
one else, & it is a matter of gratification for me to know there is plenty 
of time between now & the 7th  of Nov r for them to select a candidate 
more suitable to their taste or views, & should they succeed in electing 
him, I shall experience no mortification at the result 
</p><p>
On the subject of the letter referred to which has been placed in the 
hands of a friend subject to my order or any friend authorized by me ; I 
have written to the Honb  R. Johnson of the U. S. Senate from Mary 
land authorizing him to have it published ; he having written me advising 
that I would do so ; the only objection I had to this course in the first 
instance, was my dislike to my name appearing in the newspapers so frequently ; not that if done it it would have the effect to injure me in the 
opinion of any real friend, no matter how much it might be misrepresented, criticised & commented on by pretended friends or open enemies 
</p><p>
I must now since my accceptance of the nomination by the Whig convention expect to be assailed from every quarter of the Union in the 
most outrageous manner without regard to truth, decency or anything 
else, by pensioned editors of n. papers, hired scriblers, as well as many 
others, which I have determined shall not be the cause of any thing like 
mortification, but will continue to pursue the " even tenor of my way " 
without turning to the right or left to notice them 
The facts in the case I consider very plain, so much so that I deem 
the statement of Judge Sander referred to unimportant at the present 
time & would do no good if made public, particularly as I have indorsed 
his course & that of his colliegues, which from the course things had 
taken I considered I was bound to do, no matter who approved or disapproved it 
</p><p>
I have seen the comments in the Buena Vista on my severy letters 
which have been published heretofore in various news papers, all of which 
have given me but little concern ; nor do I know that I should have again 
thought of that mighty effort at vituperation had you not brought it to 
my notice, as I can assure you it had passed by without making the slight 
est impression 
</p><p>
I thought it best to authorise the Hon 1 R. Johnson to have my let 
ter published, preferring from certain reasons that he should do so than 
any one else; at the same time I should have been quite pleased had you 
taken the responsibility of doing so 
</p><p>
We were very much pleased to learn that Dr Wood & Ann were in 
good health, as well as your uncle & family which I flatter myself will 
long continue to be the case Your aunt & Betty are only in tolerable 
health, they desire to be kindly remembered to you as well as best regards 
to your uncle & family should they have returned to the city ; as well as 
the Dr & Ann. 
</p><p>
I expect to leave here in about a week with your aunt & Betty for 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Pascagoula" rel="city">Pascagoula</a>, a watering place on the gulf back of New Orleans, where we 
will spend some three or four weeks & then return here 
</p><p>
I sincerely hope your affairs are as prosperous as you could expect. 
</p><p>
Wishing you continued health & prosperity 
</p><p>
I remain truly & sincerely 
</p><p>
Your affectionate 
Uncle
