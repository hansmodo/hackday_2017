DEAR SIR : Owing to an absence of unexpected duration from this city, your letter of the 23d of May was not 
received until a few days ago. My daughter has gone on to <a href="/results.php?city=bedford" rel="city">Bedford</a>. My engagements in this city not permitting me to attend her, I shall follow in a few days, and 
be at your house before the 20th of August. Let me find you at home, or not far off. I propose to pass two 
or three days with you. My daughter was charmed with your hospitable and friendly overture, and wished much 
to avail herself of it. This, however, will not be in her power till October, the period of my return from Kentucky, when it is probable she may. 
</p><p>
I omit, till a personal interview, a further answer to your obliging letter. 
</p><p>
Two young gentlemen of respectable connections and character, are on their way down the river, Mr. S. 
Swartwout, of <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and Mr. S. Ogden, of New 
Jersey. I have desired that they would stop at your door, hand you this, and wait long enough to answer any 
inquiries you might please to make about Cis-Montane men or things. I pray that they may experience your wonted courtesy 
</p><p>
Very respectfully, your friend and faithful servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="me">A. BURR</a>.
