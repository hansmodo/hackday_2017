DEAR SKELLY : 
</p><p>
I am glad to hear you are well. Mr. Scott showed me a letter from 
you. I fear the Commandant of <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> cannot settle anything in 
regard to your exchange, however, on your arrival in this city. I do 
assure you that Lieut. Raven el shall be immediately parolled, and sent 
out of town. I am going to a grand German fete champetre. I hope 
you got mine by Mr, Bordeaux. 
</p><p>
Yours, in haste, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=all" rel="me">A. LESLIE</a>. 
</p><p>
You shall hear from me very soon, if I don t see you. 
</p>
