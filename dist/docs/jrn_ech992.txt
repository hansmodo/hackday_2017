During the past week it rained nearly one whole day, which is a very rare occurrence during the summer season. We have had fine pleasant weather, as warm as our own summer. When the weather is perfectly clear, the snow-covered peaks of the Andes can be seen at a great distance. There is a well-known Spanish proverb, which I have heard here:
</p>
<blockquote>
    From a woman at the window,<br/>
    From a monk in the street,<br/>
    And from the rising sun,<br/>
    We may guess what the weather is going to be.

Since we have been in port we have been exchanging civilities with various companies from the States bound for California. We were visited one evening by a large and merry crowd from the Mechanic's Own of New York. We treated them to as much liquor as they could drink and danced on the quarter-deck until after midnight. By that time many were very much "soaked."

Atkins lost his purse with every cent of money in it, and on this account I advanced him ten dollars. His purse contained between fifteen and sixteen, and although it was a small sum, nevertheless when it is all we have, it becomes a great loss. Yesterday most of our sailors and head cook and steward were discharged at their own request, and hence we have to ship new hands.

A serious disturbance has taken place between Mr. and Mrs. H. and Messrs. M. and L. who have become very intimate since coming aboard. Mr. H. has complained to the American Consul and it is said that the Consul has recommended them to be put on shore and also told Mr. H. that he would be justifiable in
shooting either of them. He now goes armed with a revolver. Mrs. H. and her husband also dissolved partnership, and henceforth she says she does not wish to be called by that name. None of the parties have yet been removed, and the bitterest enmity exists between them.

The Chilians are now at war with the Araucanian Indians in the south, and large bodies of troops are being sent hither. Saturday a regiment arrived here from Santiago to be sent to the theatre of war. Early this morning I went on shore to witness the embarkation of several hundred soldiers. Before embarking they marched through the principal streets, followed by a vast multitude of men, women and children, and as the troops entered the boats there were many heart-rending partings between husbands, brothers, friends and lovers.

During the past few days we have amused ourselves by fishing and we have been able to supply ourselves with two meals per day of excellent fish. I had a tooth refilled by a dentist from Canada, for which I paid two dollars. A cockfight took place in the town but this I did not witness.

I have written several letters and paid 56 1/4 cents for each half ounce to the English Consul, and sent two small papers which cost 37 1/2 cents each25 for the postage and fifty for the papers.

This afternoon we received the glad tidings that all hands should be aboard at 12 o'clock tomorrow as we would set sail at that time.
