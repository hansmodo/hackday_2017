DEAR Free Trader --Last Monday morning, about daybreak, we were awakenedby groans and sounds of distress at the side of our wagon. "Who is that?--what is the matter?" was a simultaneous inquiry. "It is me--O!--I'm in such pain!--I'm very sick!" We instantly roused up and found Mr. Harris was not with us and that he was the sufferer.
</p><p>
On getting out of the wagon, we found him leaning against a wheel in great agony of pain, occasionally retching convulsively; and, on learning that he had been up two or three times before, we became at once satisfied that the cholera had insinuated its poisonous fangs amongst us. I immediately gave him a large dose of laudanum, the only remedy or palliative at hand, and sent for a physician, who came within an hour and commenced an active course of medicine.
</p><p>
He grew worse, however, nothwithstanding all our efforts. Vomiting, purging, cramping became excessive--with cold limbs and hands, and cold sweat pouring from his brow; still we worked over him till noon, when we found the symptoms had changed. The vomiting, purging, and cramping ceased, his limbs became warm and the pain in the bowels was much less severe. In this condition
he remained for three hours, thinking, with us, that he was better. About four o'clock in the afternoon, while laying in comparative ease, he was taken with gasping for breath and in ten minutes he lay a corpse before us.
</p><p>
Such a sudden and unaccountable change overwhelmed us for a moment. We could scarcely believe him dead; yet it was palpable to our senses, and the stern reality bid us prepare for the last obsequies for the dead. We laid him out as well as our slender means would permit and kept watch till morning when, with heavy hearts, we dug his grave and, with none to help us in the last sad rite, we consigned him "to that bourn from which no traveler returns."
</p><p>
Poor Harris! with high hopes he left home, and this was the end of them. He was a man of singularly honest and upright intentions, of great moral worth, simple in his habits, and sincere in his professions. A Christian, he lived as near to what he believed his duty as the weakness of human nature allowed him. We felt that one of our best men had been taken. This is the only case that I am cognizant of where cholera has been fatal to a temperate man. He never drank ardent spirits as a beverage and was temperate in all his habits. My impression is that the state of the atmosphere was the cause. In the lower part of the town was one or two slaughter houses, around which were large quantities of pigs' feet, several dead cattle and hogs, which created an effluvia almost insufferable; and I cannot understand why the corporation of St. Joseph allows such abominable nuisances to exist when cholera is among them and so many hundreds of people are daily arriving.
</p><p>
With regard to general operations I can add but little to my former letter. The arrivals by steamboats are becoming less; some are already tired of the expedition and are offering their teams and outfit for sale, while others are moving off to different points; so that instead of increasing at St. Joseph the numbers are rather decreasing.
</p><p>
After repairing our wagon bows, which were damaged in St. Louis, my team, under Mr. Fredenburg's directions, started up the river on Wednesday, April 26, towards Fort Kearny, to join the Dayton Company, which had preceded us, while I remained behind to get letters and papers by the next mail. That night I received a touch of the elephant--a rub of the "shadow of coming events." I began to grow cold, and, hang me, if fire would warm me. In about an hour and a half, I got warm, warmer, warmest; and now ice wouldn't cool me. I tried the effect of cold water--humph! I had by some means swallowed a steam engine and all the water I poured down was converted into vapour at once; and, like the insatiable leech, there was a cry of "give, give, give!" till I thought my boiler would burst and I should be blown to atoms. A regular chill and fever was on me. The next morning I "went it" on blue mass: not
high mass, but blue pill, and lay up to dry, thinking that by Friday I could go on.
</p><p>
Friday morning the sun rose pleasantly and I arose smiling, under the impression that we would shine in company that day. I fed my pony early (I suppose the sun had fed his before I was up), intending to start after breakfast.
</p><p>
After a cup of coffee the sun put his head into a cloud and I put mine bewteen two blankets with another chill, which ended with another heating-up operation. However, after noon I got off my bed and on my pony, determined to get away from the cologne of St. Joseph. I was so weak I could hardly sit on my horse, but the pure air revived me, and I gained strength every mile, and by the time I reached the pretty town of Savannah, fourteen miles, I felt quite comfortable.
</p><p>
On Saturday I overtook my team, and then commenced an active warfare against internal combustion.
</p><p>
By the way, I got no letters from home and have not received the least word from any of my friends since I left, and now, probably, shall not.
</p><p>
We have been traveling over a high rolling prairie for the last two days, with considerable settlements. We reached here yesterday at noon and learned that Mr. Green, instead of going to Fort Kearny to cross the river, had crossed eight miles south of us, and that the South Bend company had gone on to the Fort; so that this divides the two companies for the present. I have sent my wagon to join the Dayton company and am laying up here to give my cold chills "a lick" if they don't give me "Jesse." You will perceive by my writing that I am not desperately sick and don't expect to be: I stop as a matter of precaution to attend to myself in season. I took cold the night poor Harris died in watching over him. The rest are all well.
</p><p>
The grass on the bottom is good, but it will not be fit to start on the plains under ten or fifteen days.
</p><p>
By the way, it is a singular fact, so far as my observation extends, that all those who have been sick either lived on the river or came up it, while those who came across the country have not been attacked by disease of any kind. I am now well enough to join my company, which I propose to do tomorrow, and shall then be in the Pottawatomie country I have an opportunity to forward this to St. Joseph tomorrow and shall embrace it. I think I shall be able to write you again before we leave. It is twelve miles to the nearest post office.
</p><p>
Truly yours,
</p><p>
