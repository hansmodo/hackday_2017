Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In my last I transmitted copies of my correspondence with 
the Minister, respecting the subject of the conversation mentioned in mine of the thirtieth of last month, of which, as well as of 
those of the seventeenth and twenty-second, copies are here en 
closed. 
</p><p>
I think it is proper to mention to you now a circumstance 
relating to that conversation, because it may explain transactions connected therewith. I had good reason to believe, that 
a private speculation was at the bottom of the proposals made 
to me, and the extreme urgency which was exhibited by one 
of the conferees, who had been designated to me as concerned 
therein, tended not a little to confirm the information I had re 
ceived. The wrath excited by the unwillingness on my part 
to jump over all the bounds of my powers and instructions, did 
by no means lessen, but came in support of the same idea. 
Since that period I have been asked by a person, who said he 
was offered a bill drawn by the government here on the treasury of the United States, whether such a bill would be paid. I 
expressed my surprise, and was told that this bill would be for 
the sum decreed by the Assembly to be employed in purchasing supplies for the colony of St Domingo. I observed that it 
seemed a strange procedure either to sell or buy such a bill ; 
because the vender could only employ the money in America, 
and of course need not risk a draft ; and the purchaser, who 
must make the expenditure, could not, I supposed, find his ac 
count in the transaction. This led to an explanation. The 
bill was to be paid for in Assignats at par, six or nine months 
hence, and the produce was to be employed in purchasing manufactures suitable to the colony in this country. I told the 
person who applied to me, that I did not think this would be considered in America as falling within the decree, and that no 
good reason could be assigned for paying, under great disadvantages in Philadelphia, what could be paid with great advantage 
in Paris, when the sum paid was not to be expended in the 
United States but. in France. At length the true object of this 
application to me came out. I discovered it was merely a 
scheme of speculation to be carried into effect, if I could be induced to recommend the payment, under what was known to 
be a favorite idea with me, viz. the expending in America what 
we owe to France, and for the support of the colony of St Domingo. As my concurrence could not be hoped for, I believe 
the plan is abandoned, but perhaps it is only abandoned in appearance. 
</p><p>
I also take the liberty to enclose the extract of a letter from 
Mr Short respecting M. de Lafayette, with my answer. I 
understand that he was forwarded from Luxemburg privately on the route to Vienna, and had got as far as Brisgaw 
several days ago. I presume that his treatment will depend 
very much on the success of the military operations. If the 
allied monarchs, finding themselves disappointed in their 
expectations from the present campaign, are obliged to look 
forward to more extensive and more permanent efforts, they 
will probably endeavor to gain one of the great parties in this 
country ; and should they turn their eyes towards the Quatrevingt-neufs, or Feuillants, they will naturally consider M. 
de Lafayette as the most fitting instrument to be employed, 
and he will naturally desire to aid in the establishment of the 
party and the principles, which he considers as true supporters 
of liberty in this country. For you will observe, that in like 
manner as the Clerical and Aristocratic parties considered 
the Assembly in <a href='/results.php?year=1789'>1789</a> as a usurper, the leaders of that 
Assembly affixed on the Jacobins the same charge of usurpation, and now the leaders of the last revolution are charged 
by some of their brethren with Feuillantism. 
</p><p>
You will see by the gazettes, that there is the same enmity 
between the present chiefs, which prevailed heretofore against 
those whom they considered as their common enemies, and if 
either of the present parties should get the better, it would 
probably again divide ; for party, like matter, is divisible ad 
infinitum, because things which depend on human opinion 
can never be tried by any common standard. And not only 
is it unavoidable, that there should be differences among different men, but it is even uncommon to find in the same man the 
same sentiments, for a continued length of time, even upon the same subject, for either the circumstances change or else the man. 
</p><p>
You will see that the King of Prussia has made some overtures for treaty, which were not listened to. I consider the 
offer as a mere military manoeuvre, because it is not possible 
that treaty should succeed in the present moment, and because 
preparations are making for more vigorous efforts the ensuing 
campaign. I am told that both Sweden and Denmark have 
acceded to the league, and that they count on the assistance 
of Great Britain, should that become necessary. 
</p><p>
On this last subject much may be said. Of the King's personal opinions there can be no doubt, and I have some little 
reason to believe, that not only his ministers, but the great mass 
of property and interest in that kingdom would readily embark 
in a contest to crush opinions, which are considered fatal to the 
peace and order of civil society. And you know of how little 
consequence it is, as to human action, whether opinions be or 
be not well founded. On the other hand, there is a party in 
England, not inconsiderable as to numbers, and very important 
from the activity of its members, who, joining to high notions 
of civil liberty some mixture of the enmities and prejudices of 
particular sects of religion, aim at a subversion of Monarchy, 
Hierarchy, and Aristocracy. But as any great convulsion 
must necessarily overturn the stupendous fabric of national 
credit, which has been erected within this century, there are 
among the chieftains even of this party several, who rather 
wish that the battles for freedom should be fought on French 
than English ground. Yet these same men, should it become 
necessary to take a decided part, would range themselves, I 
think, under the revolutionary standard. But in this uncertain 
state of men and things the ministry have to fear from inaction, 
that the principles of the government will be sapped, and they 
have to fear a total defeat, should they declare war without 
first securing the aid of the opposition. This they have been 
laboring at for some time, but with little effect, because there 
are two or three great places desired by both parties. Of 
these intrigues, however, Mr Pinckney will, I doubt not, give 
you ample details, as they are closely connected with the objects 
of his mission. I have little doubt but that a junction, or coalition, between these two parties would enable the government 
to act with all the energy it could wish, and there seems to me 
to be a little cause not much noticed, but of considerable effect, 
which may lead them into a war. It is the legal advantage to 
be gained over those, who, in supporting certain opinions, may 
in case of war be brought under the statute of treasons as adhering to the foreign enemy. 
</p><p>
An opponent more dreadful than any of the armies which 
can be sent against this country &gt; or any of the parties by which 
it may be distracted, seems to be preparin ghis vengeance. Fa 
mine is among the things on which to calculate. The crop in 
Sicily was short ; that of the Southern provinces, always insufficient, is much less than usual. The supplies usually 
drawn from the coast of Barbary will, I am told, be totally cut 
off by those powers, who, in consequence of the affair of the 
tenth of August, mean to break with this country. The grain 
provinces on the north and east, if not possessed by the enemy, 
will be totally exhausted by the two armies ; and Poland, 
whose granaries are shut up till the next spring, will be engrossed by the enemy to furnish his own magazines. I consider it 
therefore as next to certain, that the want here will be very 
great during the ensuing year ; and as this must, by the end of 
December, become apparent to everybody, most other resources will then be shut by the hand of mercantile speculation. 
Hence it would seem, that our merchants would act wisely in 
sending hither cargoes of flour, and I have but one apprehension in recommending it, which is, that, from the laxity of government, property of that sort may become precarious, when 
the price has got so high as to oppress the poor, and yet it 
must so rise, or else the merchant will suffer, because the 
exchange cuts off a great- proportion of what he receives. 
</p><p>
I submit, my dear Sir, to your better judgment all these 
ideas, persuaded that you will turn them to the best account ; 
and I pray you to believe in that sincere regard with which I 
am, &c.
