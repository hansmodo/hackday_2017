My Dear Bertus:  I received only a few days ago your letter of the
12th.  I am very sorry to hear of your afflictions, but hope you have
shaken off all of them.  You must keep your eyes open, you precious
boy, and not run against noxious vines and fevers.  I have just returned
from a visit to Fluvanna.  I rode up the gray and extended my
peregrinations into Albemarle, but no further than the Green Mountain
neighbourhood.  I made short rides, stopping every evening with some
friend, and had a very pleasant time.  I commended you to all the young
ladies on the road, but did not know I was extolling a poisoned beau!
You must go up and see Miss Francis Galt.  Tell Fitzhugh I wrote to
him before I went away.  I am glad to hear that your corn is so fine,
and that you are making preparations to put in a good crop of wheat.
I wish I had a little farm somewhere, to be at work too.  Custis is
paying a visit to his friend, Captain Watkins, in Powhatan.  He came
up for him last Saturday, and bore him off.  He has got quite well
now, and I hope will continue so.  Agnes is also well, though still
feeble and thin.  Your mother, Life, and myself as usual.  We have
not heard for some time from daughter.  A report has reached us of
her being at Mr. Burwell's.  Miss Mary Cocke and her brother John
paid us a short visit from Saturday to Monday, and several of our
neighbors have been over to spend the day.  We have a quiet time,
which is delightful to me, but I fear not so exhilarating to the
girls.  I missed Uncle Carter's visit.  He and his Robert rode up on
a pair of colts while I was in Fluvanna, and spent several days.  I
wish we were nearer you boys.  I want to see you very much, but do
not know when that can be.  I hope Johnny is well.  I have heard
nothing from his father since we parted in Richmond, but hear that
Fitz has gone to see his mother.  All here send their best love to
you, and I pray that every happiness may attend you.

                      Your devoted father,
</p><p>

Bertus was a contraction of Robertus, my father's pet name for me
as a child.  My afflictions were poison-oak, chills, and fever.
