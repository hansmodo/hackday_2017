</p><p>
I have been now near 6 Weeks waiting for the Sailing of the Pacquet, and know not yet when she is like to sail.
</p><p>
I received yours of the 7th Inst. with the Invoice and Memorandum, which I shall endeavour to comply with. As to the Pay, I expect not to meddle with your Paper Currency; for I always lose by it. With the Goods I shall send Directions about the Time and Manner of Payment.
</p><p>
My Love to dear Sister and Thanks for your and her kind Wishes and Prayers, is all at present from Your affectionate Brother
