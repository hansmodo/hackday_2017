</p><p>
My Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met friend colleague">Burr</a>,
</p><p>
I have resigned my office, and am now preparing to leave <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>
to go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=princeton" rel="city">Princeton</a>, agreeable to the plan in my letter by Colonel
Wadsworth. This week I expect to finish a little private business I
have on hand, and, by the latter end of the next, to be settled in a
regular course of study with Mr. Stockton. What think you of this
alteration in the plan we settled? Can you leave Mr. Osmer without
injury? I assure you, the only motive I have to prefer Stockton is a
desire to qualify myself for practice as soon as possible. All my
friends are against my studying in Connecticut, for the reason
mentioned in my last; and they all recommend Stockton to me. I am
therefore determined to study with him.
</p><p>
I am very much afraid that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=princeton" rel="city">Princeton</a> will be disagreeable to you on
many accounts, and particularly on account of the number of
acquaintances you have in and near it. This is a misfortune, to be
sure; but do as I shall, neglect them all; it is matter of perfect
indifference to me whether I affront them or not. My object is to
study with the closest attention. I must do it. I have no other
resource.
</p><p>
Permit me to declare, like a sincere friend, that my happiness is so
intimately connected with yours, that I shall be chagrined to an
extreme if you find it inconvenient to join me. We could be useful to
each other. Besides facilitating each other's progress in the law, we
could improve ourselves in writing and speaking. In one word--I am
confident I should acquire as much knowledge in three years with you
as in six years without you. I never was more serious. Come,
therefore, immediately, and bring Mr. Tetard with you to perfect us in
the French language, which I have paid little attention to since I
wrote you, and indeed since you left me.
</p><p>
Pray why have you neglected to answer my letter by Colonel Wadsworth?
I suspect something extraordinary is the matter with you. Or are you
so angry as not to think I merit an answer? Whatever your reason was,
let me request you to favour me with an answer to this by the first
opportunity. If it is sent under cover to Mr. Stockton, it will
perhaps reach me sooner.
</p><p>
It is reported, and pretty general believed, that Sir Henry Clinton,
with the fleet that came from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a> about six weeks ago, has
touched at Georgia; taken Prevost's troops with him, and gone either
to St. Augustine or the Havannah. This is very important news, if
true; but it seems to wait confirmation.
</p><p>
Your unalterable friend,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rot" rel="me">ROBERT TROUP</a>.
