MY DEAR, 
</p><p>
I would not lose the opportunity of writing to you, though I must be short. 
</p><p>
Tedious indeed is our business slow as snails. I have not been used to such ways. We sit only before dinner. We dine at four o clock. We are crowded with a levee in the evening. 
</p><p>
Fifty gentlemen meeting together, all strangers, are not acquainted with each other's language, ideas, views, designs. They are therefore jealous of each other fearful, timid, skittish.
