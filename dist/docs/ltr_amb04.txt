Dear Hans,<br><br>
I am having a very energetic day and I just thought that I would do one of my favorite things...
write a letter to a person that I care about- how are you doing?<br><br>
How was your junior year? Good, bad, so-so, or what? When does your senior year start? I'd really
like to hear about it all if you have a chance to write or call.<br><br>
I heard from Heidi before she left for North Carolina, but my address has changed, and I'm not even sure
if my phone number is the same one that I gave her, or if she has it.<br><br>
I am probably going to start working soon. My specialty is Psychiatry. It's just my thing. It's what I am
good at, It's what I like to do. As you may guessed, philosophy is one of my passions. I love to turn a
thought or a cultural value inside and back again. What is madness and what is insanity? What is health?
There are no easy answers and that is what catches my attention.<br><br>
I telephoned my brother Harvey tonight, and I talked to he and Bonnie for the first in quite a few years -
with the exception of last Christmas. I am trying to make an effort to forgive Harvey his bigotry and bitterness.
It's hard to do, but i at least felt that I could tolerate him, and I am feeling almost immune to his criticisms
and put downs. It used to make me feel bad about myself when I was younger, and it really ate away at Hayden. I
see it now as Harvey's inadequacies, not mine. Some lessons take so long to learn.<br><br>
Anyway- I hope that you are getting psyched to go for it as far as graduation is concerned. Don't you go getting melancholy 
because Heidi and your aunt and uncle have moved. You can do it, you need to do it, and you are going to do it.
Your dad is watching you and so am I. Senior years were like gun laps in a track meet for me... I was tired, bored, and
just wanted it to be over... then I somehow got the adrenaline to kick in. It had always helped me to know that there where
people on the sidelines telling me that I could do it, but sometimes it can get lonely.<br><br>
If you want to talk about anything, feel free to call. Call collect. I don't care what topic you pick. Think of me as your 
late night talk show host, without a censor.<br><br>
I'm enclosing a picture for you. It's one of my "doctor" shots, and I really don't look this "Old Maidish" in person.<br><br>
How's your imagination? Are you keeping it free?<br><br>
Don't lose it. I need a new sheet - hold on...<br><br><br>

Now it is the following day. I have to get ready for a picnic on Tuesday. I am a member of a parenting group here in the
city, and we are having a parent/ child picnic. I am bringing the beans, potato salad, and some non-alcoholic beer. The NA
beer is catching on with people here, and it really does make sense at times. So, in spite of getting ridiculed by some people,
I am bringing some. People need to quit drinking and driving. Some people need to just quit drinking altogether.<br><br>
Anyway, it should be fun.<br><br>
Do you know what you will do after you graduate? I have to tell you, I really respect what you have accomplished so far.<br><br>
Well Hans, I guess I will close this letter. Keep in touch. I will.<br><br>
love,<br>
Anne Marie<br><br>
(and Nathaniel)<br><br>
