My Dear Brother : I received your despatch last evening 
stating I would be appointed Colonel of one of the new 
3 Battalion Regiments, this was I suppose an answer 
to my own despatch to Adjutant General asking if such 
would be the case. The fact is so many persons had 
written to me and spoken to me, all asserting they had 
seen or heard I was to have one of the new Regiments, 
that I thought the letter to me had been misdirected or 
miscarried. ... I shall promptly accept the Colonelcy 
when received and I think I can organize and prepare a 
regiment as quick as anybody. I prefer this to a Brigadier in the Militia, for I have no political ambition, and 
have very naturally more confidence in Kegulars than 
Militia. Not that they are better, braver or more patriotic, but because / know the people will submit with 
better grace to them than to Militia of any particular 
locality. . . .

I think Missouri has subsided into a quiescent state. 
There will be no attempting to execute the obnoxious 
and unconstitutional Militia Law. A prompt move on 
Little Rock from here and Cairo and recapture of Fort 
Smith from Kansas would hold Arkansas in check. A 
movement which could be made, simultaneous with that 
on Richmond. I hope no men or time will be wasted on 
Norfolk ; it is to one side and unimportant. The capture 
of Richmond would be fatal to Virginia, and the occupation of Cumberland, Hagerstown and Frederick by the 
Pennsylvanians, whilst troops threaten Winchester from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> would make the further occupation of Harper's Ferry useless. But after all the Mississippi is the 
great problem of the Civil War, and will require large 
forces and good troops. 
</p><p>
Affectionately your brother,
