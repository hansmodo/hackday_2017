On Wednesday afternoon, July 3, after having worked off the first edition of the Sonora Herald in the Times office at Stockton, the proprietor solicited me to take a horse and start immediately for Sonora, seventy-five or eighty miles distant, in order that the papers might be distributed. I immediately prepared myself for the journey and started about four o'clock, fully armed and with blankets and papers, on horse. After riding about 28 miles I stopped at Simmon's Tent, where I stayed all night and slept on a pile of boards a few rods distant, paying six and a half dollars for what my horse ate, and three dollars for my supper and breakfast. I started again in the morning a little after sunrise, rode on over the hills and plains under a scorching sun, and reached Sonora about three o'clock in the afternoon.
</p><p>
At this time great excitement existed along the road on account of the many horrid murders that had been committed within a short time. I had passed the bodies of three Americans who had been killed by the Mexicans when, in the distance, I saw coming towards me a figure on horse. Being startled, I spurred my horse and he did likewise. We sped past each other, each being determined to escape death by the hand of a Mexican. But as we hurried past, each saw that the
other was an American. We then turned, saluted, and continued on our journeys.
</p><p>
The day after my arrival I distributed copies of the first number of the Herald throughout the town. On the following day I bought lumber, borrowed a saw and hatchet, and fitted up some "stands" in a tent which we use for an office.
</p><p>
I have known of printing offices in log cabins with the latchstring always hanging out, but here, I am seated at a table covered with papers in the middle of a "rag house," ten by fourteen feet, surrounded by all the paraphernalia of a printing establishment. When I speak of printing materials, I do not mean that we have such an assortment of things as we had in the Record office. On the contrary, we have but two or three cases of old type, a wooden "stick" manufactured by my own hands with a jackknife, and an old Ramage press that has long been a pioneer in the business, the first numbers of nearly all the papers now printed in California having been printed upon it after it had been brought second-hand from the States through Mexico: 1st, the paper at Monterey; 2d, Alta California, San Francisco; 3d, Placer Times, Sacramento City; 4th, Times, Stockton; and lastly, the Sonora Herald. It well deserves the title of the "Pioneer Press." It has spoken to millions and no one can calculate the amount of good it has already done, nor estimate what amount it is yet capable of doing. It has already crossed the continent in its mission of good from the Atlantic shores to those of the Pacific, and is now on its way back. I doubt not but it will next be heard from on the summit of the Sierra Nevada range, and hope it will continue in its course until it is met on the broad plains by something from the East. Then as a reward for past
services, it well deserves to be placed by the side of Franklin's old press in Washington as a curiosity for future generations to look upon. In a century to come when our children have read the history of California, with what wonder would they look upon that press. It has escaped many dangers, fire and shipwreck, and when its labors are over, I trust it will receive an eulogy worthy of the subject.

Sonora is the county seat of Tuolumne County, about two hundred and twenty-five miles southeast of San Francisco. The country round about is very hilly and mountainous, being forty miles from the main range of the Sierra Nevada. Many of the mountains are covered with a rather inferior pine and scrubby oak, while others are perfectly bare or thickly covered with chaparral. This latter constitutes the haunts of the grizzly bear, quite plentiful in this neighborhood. Several unlucky hunters have been killed by them and others badly wounded. Only last Sunday a man was found about four miles from this place, literally torn to pieces, quite dead, with his trusty rifle lying by his side. It is supposed the bear came upon him suddenly without giving him time to fire. They are very ferocious and often do much harm after they are severely wounded. Their meat is excellent.

About two years ago this place, one of the richest mineral districts in this region, constituted the chief headquarters of the Mexicans, principally from the State of Sonora, Mexico, and was then known as Campo de Sonora. The whole neighborhood abounded in rich diggings and for a few months they were left to pursue their labors in undisturbed peace. Bullfights, fandangos, and other Spanish amusements took place almost every evening and the people lived quite happily,
gathering their ounces during the day from the rich placers and spending them at the monte table or fandango at night. At this time it was computed that they numbered some five or six thousand. But this happy state of things was limited to but a short duration. In a little while the Americans learned that very rich diggings existed in the neighborhood and they flocked in by hundreds. Feuds, quarrels, disputes and contentions were the result.
</p><p>
Now miners generally are doing but poorly in this region, as they are almost everywhere else. Individual mining is for the most part over, I believe. Hereafter it must be carried on by large companies with extensive machinery. The small streams and many of the flats, gulches and ravines have been dug over two or three times and in the rainy season scores of miners are to be seen walking about and every now and then stooping down to pick something up. It is gold they are after, and sometimes they are quite successful. The rain softens and washes off the top dirt and leaves the gold exposed on the surface. This would be quite an interesting occupation if it would only pay a little better.
</p><p>
Many companies have worked for months in digging canals, building dams and turning large rivers, in the hope of reaping a rich harvest from the river bottoms. But they have been disappointed and hundreds have left for the dry diggings. What the thousands who are here and on their way are going to do this winter, I cannot anticipate. An unparalleled amount of suffering will doubtless be witnessed.
</p><p>
This section of the country has been infested by numerous bands of Mexican guerillas, and life and property have been very insecure. Within a fortnight
every morning's sun brought to light a newly murdered victim. The whole country became alarmed. Public meetings were held, and organized parties raised to ferret out and bring to justice the authors of these horrid crimes. The people grew wild on the subject and it is not to be wondered at.
</p><p>
Among the persons murdered was one named Miller, of Reading, Pennsylvania. He and his partner kept a public house on the road between this and Stockton. One evening about bedtime, seven Mexicans came in and professed to be friends. After taking a drink and buying a sword, one of them made a pass with it at the man behind the counter. This was thought to be a joke and so passed off. Soon after, however, another pass was made and this time the man was stabbed through the right breast. A scuffle then ensued between the two Americans and seven Mexicans in which one of the former was killed and the other badly wounded. During the affray an American teamster who was sleeping in a back part of the tent awoke and seizing a six-shooter, rushed out and shot one of the Mexicans through the head, killing him instantly. He then had to flee for his own safety. The Mexicans plundered the tent and left the two men for dead. I saw the wounded man a few days after the occurrence. He was then very low but hopes were entertained for his recovery.
</p><p>
Things came to a fearful pass and daily grew worse. No one dared to travel without being armed to the teeth. At night every one lay down with his pistol under his head and rifle by his side. The miners along the lone hillside took turns and kept watch during the silent hours of the night. A violent feeling of hostility existed between the Americans and Mexicans.
</p><p>
Since the work of murder continued without the capture of the perpetrators, the Americans threatened to issue an edict compelling every Mexican to leave the country. This I hoped would not be done as many of them are as good citizens as our own people and quite as well-disposed. It would be making the innocent suffer with the guilty, yet the measure had many advocates.
</p><p>
On Wednesday morning, the tenth of July, three Indians and a Mexican were discovered burning the tent and bodies of two Americans about five miles from this place. They were immediately arrested and brought here under a strong escort of armed Americans, highly excited and enraged. They were taken before the magistrate but before the hearing was gone through with, the excited people seized the prisoners, took them to the top of an adjacent hill, selected a jury under a tree, tried and found them guilty, and sentenced them to be hung. The sentence was about to be carried into effect, for the ropes were already around their necks and over a limb, and all that was wanting to finish their existence was the word "pull" to be given. The Mexican was even raised off the ground and was dangling in the air. Before the rope was stretched, he fell upon his knees, kissed a cross he carried in his bosom, uttered a prayer in Spanish, and resigned himself to his fate.
</p><p>
At this critical moment for the prisoners, the county judge with other citizens interfered and begged the people not to assume so great a responsibility but to let the law take its own course and justice would be done. The prisoners were then brought back and placed in the jail but by this time the multitude had become so desperate that it was feared the jail would be torn
down. The sheriff and his posse were very vigilant and declared that the first man who should interfere would do so at the peril of his life. No further demonstration was made and the people returned to their homes.
</p><p>
The coroner held an inquest and ascertained that the two Americans had been killed several days before, as their bodies were partially decomposed. The prisoners stated that they had discovered the bodies the previous evening, and they agreed to burn them in the morning pursuant to a religious custom in vogue among their own people.
</p><p>
On Monday, the 14th of July, our town was thrown into a state of great excitement by the appearance in the streets of a company of about sixty men, marching to the sound of fife and drum, armed with guns and rifles, and bearing the American flag. They had come from the scene of the late murder to see the laws carried out. They were very excited and would scarcely submit to any delay. They halted opposite the court house, where Judge Tuttle addressed them in a neat speech, urging them to be moderate and assuring them that the criminals would be tried as soon as possible and that justice would be done. If they were found guilty they would speedily meet their just deserts and if not guilty, they would surely be acquitted. He urged them to respect the laws and acquiesce in the verdict of the jury, whatever it might be. At the conclusion of this sound advice, three cheers were proposed but the angry crowd was illy disposed to submit to the law's delays and they sullenly marched to the prison, where it was agreed that the prisoners should be tried the following day. In the meantime a strong guard was placed over them from the ranks of the company.
</p><p>
A rumor reached town that the prisoners were
colleagued with a band of guerillas, headed by a notorious Mexican chief, in a camp some three or four miles distant, who plundered and murdered the people whenever an opportunity offered. About twenty armed Americans mounted on horseback, headed by our sheriff, proceeded to that place and arrested and marched into town one hundred and ten Mexicans, nearly all the men in camp, for the purpose of examining them with a view to discovering if any of them were in any way concerned in the late outrages. The next morning a force of about 1,000 miners arrived in town and the state of excitement existing can be better imagined than described.
</p><p>
In the afternoon the cases of the four men came up before the District Court. The house was crowded with armed Americans, and while the indictment was being read to the prisoners, a gun in the hands of one of the people was accidentally discharged. The crowd supposed that some one had fired at the prisoners and for a moment the utmost confusion prevailed; men were seen issuing from every door and window of the house. Numberless revolvers were instantly drawn and a number of shots immediately fired in the streets. Every man issued forth with a rifle or pistol in his hand.
</p><p>
At the report of the first gun I saw several Mexicans running who were fired at, and thinking there might be some hot work in sustaining the law, I seized my pistols and immediately repaired to the court room. Here a melancholy picture presented itself. The man whose gun had been accidentally discharged was lying in one corner, badly but not mortally wounded, the whole charge having passed through his left wrist. In the street, the district attorney, mounted on a high stump, was endeavoring in an harangue to quiet the
excited assemblage. The excitement soon died away and the crowd dispersed.
</p><p>
The supposition then was that these men were innocent and it is not likely that if they had committed the murder they would have remained in the immediate vicinity so long after. Had the authorities delayed one minute longer, doubtless four innocent men would have lost their lives at the hands of an excited populace. The one hundred and ten Mexicans were confined in a corral all night and examined the next day, but without eliciting anything in regard to the late murders, and they were therefore discharged. They had nearly all arrived in the country only a few days previous.
</p><p>
Accounts of the perpetration of fresh murders reached town and a meeting was called Saturday evening, July 19th, to adopt some course to ferret out these bands of murderers, which resulted in the call for a general mass meeting to be held on Sunday. It was reported during the meeting that an armed Mexican force of over one hundred men had just passed within sight of the town, meditating an attack. Fifty men volunteered to arm and act as guard during the night. On Sunday the meeting was numerously attended by persons from nearly all parts of the mining district. Great discontent prevailed, violent harangues were made and the following resolutions were adopted, with but one dissenting voice.
</p><p>
Resolved, That all foreigners in Tuolumne County except persons engaged in permanent business and of respectable characters, be required to leave the limits of said county within fifteen days from this date, unless they obtained a permit to remain from a committee of three to be chosen or selected by the American citizens of each camp or diggings.
</p><p>
Resolved, That all foreigners be, and they are hereby, notified to deliver their firearms and deadly weapons to the select men of each camp or diggings forthwith (except such as may have a permit to hold the same). Such select men shall give a receipt to such foreigner for the same, and each and every good citizen shall have power to disarm all foreigners.
</p><p>
These extraordinary measures have already had the effect to stop nearly all business, and times never were tighter with business men than at present. I am opposed in principle to these measures as I believe they will have no other effect than to drive all the well-disposed foreigners from the land, while the evil doers will escape and hide in the deep recesses of the mountains. Perhaps resistance will be made and if so, I predict that no little blood will be spilled. For the protection of the town, guards are stationed in the outskirts every night to prevent a surprise.
</p><p>
Two hundred Mexicans with their pack animals marched through this place on their return home, poor and dispirited. They had come here, many of them with their families, for the purpose of becoming good citizens and settling in the country. They thought, and very justly, too, that they should all have to suffer because a few bad men were among them, and sooner than be the cause of disturbances, they would return to the homes which they had so recently left.
</p><p>
Yesterday one American shot another in the street and the occurrence was not noticed as much as a dog fight at home.
</p><p>
I am at work at my trade at fifty dollars per week. Boarding is from an ounce to twenty-five dollars but by an economical arrangement mine only costs about
twelve and I pay six dollars per dozen for washing. I sleep on the "bank" (a table used by printers) rolled up in my blanket, work late and early every day, enjoy good health and feel very well contented and happy.
