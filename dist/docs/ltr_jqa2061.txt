TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
</p><p>
No. 25 [EDMUND RANDOLPH] 
</p><p>
THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, February 15, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
In the Supplement to the last <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=leyden" rel="city">Leyden</a> Gazette is contained 
the address delivered by the Batavian Deputies to the 
National Convention. The mask is no longer necessary. 
These are the persons mentioned in my letters Nos. n and 
18. They assume publicly the character of Deputies, and 
are admitted as such by the Convention. The authority 
however by virtue of which they act in this capacity does not appear; it is the spring unseen which gives all the visible motion of the Revolution in this country. It consists of a number, not very considerable, of individuals 
belonging to different parts of the country, who concerted 
secretly the mode of conducting the great political alteration which was foreseen ; who formed themselves into an 
association under the title of the Batavian Revolutionary 
Committee ; who appointed the Revolutionary Committees 
of the several cities, at present the apparent fountains of the 
public authorities ; and who employed these two deputies 
to negotiate with the Committee of Public Safety at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>. 
At the time when these persons assumed the office of 
delivering their country it was necessary for them to be as 
secret as possible in their operations. But the principles 
of the new system now establishing require publicity, and 
the banishment of all mystery or even secrecy from the 
councils of the Republic. The people are to know every 
thing that is done in their name, how it is done, and by 
whom. Such is the theory. By the practice hitherto the 
deliberations of the new Assembly of Holland are not 
accessible to the public. They publish, however, their 
journals from day to day, and their laws as soon as they are 
made. It is remarkable, also, that of a power founded upon 
the supremacy of the people and the rights of man, the 
people know not at this day whence it originated, that an 
administration resting its authority upon the foundation 
of universal suffrage consists of persons substantially chosen 
by a small revolutionary committee, and in whose appointment the people had not any agency other than that of 
acquiescence, and that while every appearance of secrecy 
is exploded and almost proscribed, the actors and even the 
plan upon which every measure hitherto adopted has been taken are altogether unknown. 
</p><p>
There are two objects of primary importance which this 
secret Revolutionary Committee wished to secure. First, 
the internal revolution which has been effected, and secondly, 
some precise conditions upon which their admission of the 
armies and their future connection with the Republic of 
France should be founded. The first was certainly well 
contrived, and has been executed to admiration. But the 
negotiations with France were not equally successful, and 
this was perhaps owing to their having been commenced at 
a period rather too late. The Deputies did not arrive at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> till the close of December, when the rivers had already 
been prepared by the hands of nature for the passage of 
the French armies. They treated secretly with the Committee of Public Safety, and probably obtained from them 
a promise, as far as they could make it, that the sovereignty 
and independence of the Republic would be preserved ; 
but as for the rest, perhaps they were told they must con 
tent themselves with a dependence upon the generosity of the French people. 
</p><p>
In a report to the Convention from their Executive 
Committees, made some time since, it was said that the 
Republic would make a peace with Holland under the 
guarantee of their own forces. Even at this moment the 
relative situation of the two nations remains a problem of 
solution not perfectly easy. 
</p><p>
On the 2Oth of January (ist Pluviose), the Representatives 
of the French people with the armies of the North and of Sambre and Meuse arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a>, and on the same 
day they published their proclamation to the Batavian people, copies of which they addressed formally to the foreign ministers residing here. In this proclamation is 
expressly said, "We appear in the midst of you as your 
friends and allies. We do not come to subdue you. The French nation will respect your independence. The Batavian people in the exercise of their sovereignty can alone change or modify the form of their government." 
</p><p>
Yet on the 25th of January Carnot announced to the 
Convention that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=amsterdam" rel="city">Amsterdam</a> was taken. On the 2yth the 
Representatives with the armies write to the Convention, 
that sundry places in the province of Holland are in the 
power of the (French) Republic. And in the beginning of 
February the Batavian Deputies address the Convention 
expressly in the name of a conquered people, and appear 
throughout their discourse to consider the fate of their 
constituents as being still dependent upon the will of the Convention. 
</p><p>
They sollicit of that body to "restore the inestimable treasure of national Independence to Holland liberated by 
them," affirming at the same time, "that this is the only means of rendering this brilliant conquest really serviceable 
to France," etc. 
</p><p>
They pray the legislators to permit the free people of the Batavian cities and country "the speedy election of their constituted authorities." 
</p><p>
The two last clauses of this address are particularly remarkable. 
</p><p>
It is in this manner alone, it is alone by the means of magistrates 
elected by the people in the provincial assemblies under the eyes 
of the Representatives of the French people, that you, citizens, will 
avoid all the evils which disorganization would produce, and which 
would be more irreparable with us than elsewhere. On these 
terms, citizens, every sacrifice will appear light to the Batavian 
people. They will even eagerly anticipate every assistance which 
you have a right to claim from them. The enthusiasm of independence reconquered will make them equal to everything. 
</p><p>
Citizens, the right of conquest has acquired to you an active industrious nation, worthy of some esteem for the labours and sufferings which in former times they sustained for Liberty. A wise 
policy and your equity will do the rest. The Batavians deserve to be free. In breaking their chains, their gratitude forges softer ones for them which they will display with glory to the world. 
</p><p>
The answer made by the President of the Committee to 
this address has not been published here, nor have I seen it. 
The Commissioners of the States General, Brantzen and Repelear, wrote to the former Pensionary Van de Spiegel 
a ciphered letter, in which they requested him particularly to observe the contents of this answer. When their courier 
arrived here the Pensionary was already dismissed. The letter was therefore delivered to Mr. Lelyveld, the deputy 
Grefficr of the States General. Lelyveld instead of communicating it to them, contrived to send it deciphered to the 
Pensionary. The circumstance was discovered. The new 
Assembly was in consequence called together at midnight, 
and sat till six in the morning. The States General were 
assembled at seven. Lelyveld was arrested. Possession 
was obtained of the ciphered letter and of the cipher, and 
a new deputy Grefficr was appointed. 
</p><p>
The representatives of the French people demanded that 
when the seals should be taken from the papers of the 
Pensionary, whom they consider as one of the bitterest enemies 
of the French Republic, one of them may be present at the 
inspection. The same demand is extended to the papers 
of the other persons under arrest, and the resolutions have 
been taken accordingly. 
</p><p>
While the Batavian deputies were asking of the Convention permission for their countrymen to constitute under the 
eyes of the French representatives a provisional government, the thing had already been done in two or three of the provinces. It is now completed in Holland, Utrecht, 
Guelders and Overyssel. In all the operation is uniform, commencing with the dismission of the regencies, and in 
tended doubtless to conclude with the dissolution of the States General, or rather their regeneration by deputations from the new Provincial Assemblies. 
</p><p>
The preservation of this nation's independence and sovereignty, at least in point of form, seems to be so generally 
the inclination of the people and of their provisional representatives, that no proposition of a different system is yet 
hazarded in the public papers, though the press has been declared free. How far this national sentiment may be strengthened in the minds of the present leaders by the 
influence of private ambition, I shall not venture to inquire. But among their soberest citizens out of office there are 
some who think the happiness of the people would be best 
promoted by annexing the United Provinces to the French 
Republic. 
</p><p>
Ever since the foundation of the Union the rival powers 
of France and England have alternately possessed great 
influence over the councils of the Republic. But the transactions of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1787">1787</a> amounted substantially to a conquest; 
from that period the government here have rather submitted 
than consented to the measures proposed to them by their 
allies. Under a different constitution and administration 
the subserviency of the nation must remain. Their naval 
power, the foundation of all their strength in the days of 
their glory, is no more. Their possessions in either India, 
destitute of their maritime protection and defence, can 
therefore in future be held only at the will of others. Their 
commerce and manufactures, which have already suffered 
so much from the successful conveniences of other nations, 
are declining from day to day. The energy of character, 
which once distinguished the people, and was at the same 
time the cause and effect of their heroic exertions and splendid achievements, has been broken by the contagious example 
of submission to foreign armies, twice exhibited in the course 
of the seven last years, and the name of Independence will only keep together a party in the Republic which would soon be dissolved in the Department. 
</p><p>
Such are the reasons upon which the advocates of this policy support their opinion. It is not for me to pronounce upon their validity, nor is it yet possible to determine 
whether it will finally prevail. The present appearances indicate the contrary. I am, etc.
