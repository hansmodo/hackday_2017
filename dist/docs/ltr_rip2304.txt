<p>
COLONEL RICHARD PLATT TO COMMODORE VALENTINE MORRIS.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, January 27th, 1814.
</p><p>
DEAR SIR,
</p><p>
In reply to yours of the 20th of November last, requesting to be
informed what was the reputation and services of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr</a> during
the revolutionary war? I give you the following detail of facts, which
you may rely on. No man was better acquainted with him, and his
military operations, than your humble servant, who served in that war
from the 28th of June, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>, till the evacuation of our capital on the
memorable 25th of November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1783">1783</a>; having passed through the grades of
lieutenant, captain, major, major of brigade, aid-de-camp, deputy
adjutant-general, and deputy quartermaster-general; the last of which
by selection and recommendation of Generals Greene, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=alm" rel="met colleague">McDougall</a>, and
Knox, in the most trying crisis of the revolution, viz., the year
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1780">1780</a>, when the continental money ceased to pass, and there was no
other fiscal resources during that campaign but what resulted from the
creative genius of Timothy Pickering, at that crisis appointed
successor to General Greene, the second officer of the American army,
who resigned the department because there was no money in the national
coffers to carry it through the campaign, declaring that he could not,
and would not attempt it, without adequate resources, such as he
abounded in during the term of nearly three years antecedently as
quartermaster-general.
</p><p>
In addition to the foregoing, by way of elucidation, it is to be
understood by you, that so early as from the latter part of the year
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>, I was always attached to a commanding general; and, in
consequence, my knowledge of the officers and their merits was more
general than that of almost any other in service. My operations were
upon the extended scale, from the remotest parts of Canada, wherever
the American standard had waved, to the splendid theatre of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=yorktown" rel="city">Yorktown</a>,
when and where I was adjutant-general to the chosen troops of the
northern army.
</p><p>
At the commencement of the revolution, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr</a>, then about
eighteen years of age, at the first sound of the trump of war (as if
bred in the camp of the great Frederick, whose maxim was to hold his
army always in readiness to break a lance with, or throw a dart
against, any assailant), quit his professional studies, and rushed to
the camp of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="colleague">General Washington</a>, at Cambridge, as a volunteer from
which he went with Colonel Arnold on his daring enterprise against
Quebec, through the wilds of Canada (which vied with Hannibal's march
over the Alps), during which toilsome and hazardous march he attracted
the attention and admiration of his commander so much, that he
(Arnold) sent him alone to meet and hurry down General Montgomery's
army from Montreal to his assistance; and recommended him to that
general, who appointed him an aid-de-camp, in which capacity he acted
during the winter, till the fatal assault on Quebec, in which that
gallant general, his aid McPherson, and Captain Cheeseman, commanding
the forlorn hope, fell. He afterwards continued as aid to Arnold, the
survivor in command.
</p><p>
Here I must begin to draw some of the outlines of his genius and
valour, which, like those of the British immortal, Wolf, who, at the
age of twenty-four, and only major of the 20th regiment, serving on
the continent, gave such specimens of genius and talents as to evince
his being destined for command.
</p><p>
At the perilous moment of Montgomery's death, when dismay and
consternation universally prevailed, and the column halted, he
animated the troops, and made many efforts to lead them on; and
stimulated them to enter the lower town; and might have succeeded, but
for the positive orders of Colonel Donald Campbell, the commanding
officer, for the troops to retreat. Had his plan been carried into
effect, it might have saved Arnold's division from capture, which had,
after our retreat, to contend with all the British force instead of a
part. On this occasion I commanded the first company in the first
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a> regiment, at the head of Montgomery's column, so that I speak
from ocular demonstration.
</p><p>
The next campaign, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr</a> was appointed aid-de-camp to
Major-general Putnam, second in command under <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="colleague">General Washington</a> at
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>; and from my knowledge of that general's qualities and the
colonel's, I am very certain that the latter directed all the
movements and operations of the former.
</p><p>
In January, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>, the continental establishment for the war commenced.
Then <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr</a> was appointed by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="colleague">General Washington</a> a
lieutenant-colonel in Malcolm's regiment, in which he continued to
serve until April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1779">1779</a>, when the ill state of his health obliged him
to retire from active service, to the regret of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=alm" rel="met colleague">General McDougall</a>,
commanding the department, and that of the commander-in-chief, who
offered to give him a furlough for any length of time, and to get
permission from the British general in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a> for him to go to
Bermuda for his health. This item will show his value in the
estimation of Generals <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="colleague">Washington</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=alm" rel="met colleague">McDougall</a>.
</p><p>
During the campaign of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>, Malcolm's regiment was with the main
army, and commanded by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Lieutenant-colonel Burr</a>. For discipline, order,
and system, it was not surpassed by any in the service; and could his
(the lieutenant-colonel's) and Wolfe's orderly-books be produced, they
would be very similar in point of military policy and instructions,
and fit models for all regiments.
</p><p>
This regiment was also but led at the Valley Forge in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a> and winter
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1778">1778</a>, under <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="colleague">General Washington</a>, and composed part of his army at
the battle of Monmouth on the 28th of June, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1778">1778</a>, and continued with
it till the close of the campaign of that year, at which time it was
placed in garrison at West Point by General Gates; but, upon <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=alm" rel="met colleague">General McDougall's</a> assuming the command of the posts in the highlands in
December, Malcolm's, Spencer's, and Patten's regiments were together
ordered to Haverstraw. The three colonels were permitted to go home
for the winter on furlough, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Lieutenant-colonel Burr</a> had the
command of the whole brigade, at a very important advanced post.
</p><p>
At this period <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=alm" rel="met colleague">General McDougall</a> ordered a detachment of about three
hundred troops, under the command of Lieutenant-colonel Littlefield,
of the Massachusetts line, to guard the lines in West<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chester" rel="city">Chester</a> county,
then extending from Tarrytown to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=white plains" rel="city">White Plains</a>, and from thence to
Mamaroneck or Sawpits, which last extension was guarded by Connecticut
troops from Major-general Putnam's division.
</p><p>
In this situation of affairs a very singular occurrence presented,
viz., that neither Lieutenant-colonel Littlefield, nor any other of
his grade, in the two entire brigades of Massachusetts troops
composing the garrison of West Point, from which the lines were to be
relieved, was competent, in the general's estimation, to give security
to the army above and the lines of those below; and, in consequence,
he was compelled to call <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr</a> from his station at Haverstraw
to the more important command of the lines in West<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chester" rel="city">Chester</a>, in which
measure, unprecedented as it was, the officers acquiesced without a
murmur, from a conviction of its expediency. At this time I was doing
the duty of adjutant-general to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=alm" rel="met colleague">General McDougall</a>.
</p><p>
It was on this new and interesting theatre of war that the confidence
and affections of the officers and soldiers (who now became permanent
on the lines, instead of being relieved every two or three weeks as
before), as well as of the inhabitants, all before unknown to Colonel
Burr, were inspired with confidence by a system of consummate skill,
astonishing vigilance, and extreme activity, which, in like manner,
made such an impression on the enemy, that after an unsuccessful
attack on one of his advanced posts, he never made any other attack on
our lines during the winter.
</p><p>
His humanity, and constant regard to the security of the property and
persons of the inhabitants from injury and insult, were not less
conspicuous than his military skill, &c. No man was insulted or
disturbed. The health of the troops was perfect. Not a desertion
during the whole period of his command, nor a man made prisoner,
although the colonel was constantly making prisoners.
</p><p>
A country, which for three years before had been a scene of robbery,
cruelty, and murder, became at once the abode of security and peace.
Though his powers were despotic, they were exercised only for the
peace, the security, and the protection of the surrounding country and
its inhabitants.
</p><p>
In the winter of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1779">1779</a>, the latter part of it, Major Hull, an excellent
officer, then in the Massachusetts line, was sent down as second to
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr</a>, who, after having become familiarized to his system,
succeeded him for a short time in command, about the last of April, at
which time <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr's</a> health would not permit him to continue in
command; but the major was soon compelled to fall back many miles, so
as to be within supporting distance of the army at the highlands.
</p><p>
The severity of the service, and the ardent and increasing activity
with which he had devoted himself to his country's cause, for more
than four years, having materially impaired his health, he was
compelled to leave the post and retire from active service. It was two
years before he regained his health.
</p><p>
Major Hull has ever since borne uniformly the most honourable
testimony of the exalted talents of his commander, by declaring his
gratitude for being placed under an officer whose system of duty was
different from that of all other commanders under whom he had served.
</p><p>
Having thus exhibited the colonel's line of march, and his operations
in service, I must now present him in contrast with his equals in
rank, and his superiors in command.
</p><p>
In September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>, the enemy came out on both sides of the Hudson
simultaneously, in considerable force, say from 2 to 3000 men. On the
east side (at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=peekskill" rel="city">Peekskill</a>) was a major-general of our army, with an
effective force of about 2000 men. The enemy advanced, and our general
retired without engaging them. Our barracks and storehouses, and the
whole village of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=peekskill" rel="city">Peekskill</a>, were sacked and burnt, and the country
pillaged.
</p><p>
On the west side, at the mouth of the Clove, near Suffren's, was
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr</a>, commanding Malcolm's regiment, about three hundred and
fifty men. On the first alarm he marched to find the enemy, and on the
same night attacked and took their picket-guard, rallied the country,
and made such show of war, that the enemy retreated the next morning,
leaving behind him the cattle, horses, and sheep he had plundered.
</p><p>
The year following, Lieutenant-colonel Thompson was sent to command on
the same lines in West<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chester" rel="city">Chester</a> by General Heath, and he was surprised
at nine or ten o'clock in the day, and made prisoner, with a great
part of his detachment.
</p><p>
Again, in the succeeding winter, Colonel Greene, of the Rhode Island
line, with his own and another Rhode Island regiment, who was a very
distinguished officer, and had with these two regiments, in the year
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>, defeated the Hessian grenadiers under Count Donop, at Red Banks,
on the Delaware, who was mortally wounded and taken prisoner,
commanded on the lines in West<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chester" rel="city">Chester</a>; there receded to Pine's bridge,
and in this position Colonel Greene's troops were also surprised after
breakfast and dispersed, the colonel himself and Major Flagg killed,
and many soldiers made prisoners, besides killed and wounded.
</p><p>
On the west side of the Hudson, in the year <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1780">1780</a>, General Wayne, the
hero of Stony Point, with a large command and field artillery, made an
attack on a block-house nearly opposite to Dobbs's ferry, defended by
cowboys, and was repulsed with loss; whereas <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Colonel Burr</a> burnt and
destroyed one of a similar kind, in the winter of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1779">1779</a>, near
Delancey's mills, with a very few men, and without any loss on his
part, besides capturing the garrison.
</p><p>
Here, my good friend commodore, I must drop the curtain till I see you
in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>, which will be on the first week in February, where I can
and will convince you that he is the only man in America (that is, the
United States) who is fit to be a lieutenant-general; and let you and
I, and all the American people, look out for Mr. Madison's
lieutenant-general in contrast.
</p><p>
I am your friend,
</p><p>
