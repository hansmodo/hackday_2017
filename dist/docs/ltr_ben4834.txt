DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your very kind Letter of the i5' h together with 
the Turkey, which prov'd exceeding fine. We regal'd a 
Number of our Friends with it, & drank your & M r Tissington's Health, which we wished sincerely. Mr Stevenson keeps about, but is ever ailing, like your Dame, 
with Rheumatic Pains that fly from Limb to Limb continually. Tis a most wicked Distemper, & often puts me in mind of the Saying of a Scotch Divine to some of his 
Brethren who were complaining that their Flocks had of late been infected with Arianism and Socinianism. Mine, 
says he, is infected with a worse ism than either of those. Pray, Brother, what can that be ? It is, the Rheumatism. 
I was a good deal mortified at not having it in my Power to call at Alfreton in my late Tours: But I hope for the 
Pleasure of seeing you both in London this Winter. M M Stevenson & Sally Franklin join in Wishes of every kind 
of Prosperity to you & yours, with, Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your oblig'd & affectionate hum Serv

B. FRANKLIN
