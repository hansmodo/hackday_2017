TO SECRETARY STANTON.

EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,<br/>
MAY 11, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1863">1863</a>
</p><p>
HON. SECRETARY OF WAR.
</p><p>
DEAR SIR:--I have again concluded to relieve General Curtis. I see
no other way to avoid the worst consequences there. I think of
General Schofield as his successor, but I do not wish to take the
matter of a successor out of the hands of yourself and General
Halleck.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p>
