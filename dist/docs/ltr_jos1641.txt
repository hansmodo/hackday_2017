Dear Brother: In compliance with your request I 
sent you a paper shortly after the reception of your 
letter, which I should have answered much sooner had I 
not been till within a few days past under the impression that it had been done. This excuse is sufficient, I suppose, for my long delay, especially as a letter 
from me is not very desirable. 
</p><p>
I hope that you still have as favorable opinions as ever 
with respect to your employment, for in my opinion a 
man's success in his profession depends upon the impressions he receives at the beginning ; for if these are favorable, most undoubtedly he will endeavor to succeed, and 
success will be the necessary consequence. You have 
now been engaged at that employment about a year and 
must be by this time quite an expert engineer. I would 
not be much astonished if when I came home I would 
find you superintendent of some public work. I have 
not received many letters from home lately; in fact, 
I am almost too busy to write many, and if I do not 
answer all their letters immediately upon their reception, they follow my example apparently, which is the 
cause of it, I presume; but after our examination in 
January I will endeavor to be a little more punctual and 
expect the same of my correspondents. At present we 
are very much engaged in preparing for the examination 
which takes place immediately after Christmas. I think 
I will still have about the same standing as I have now 
in Mathematics and French, but in Drawing I think I will 
be among the first five. Preparation for the Christmas 
spree is now all the go. I have joined in with about a 
dozen others and laid the foundation for a very good 
dinner costing about three dollars apiece. I wish we 
could get ahold of some of our western turkeys, chickens, 
and the like, which cannot be obtained here except at an 
enormous price, and as money is something to us like 
teeth, we are obliged to go without. Winter seems to be 
very reluctant about setting in. The weather at present 
is more like spring than winter. This time last winter, 
the river was closed, and we had fine skating, but no 
doubt it will soon set in with a vengeance, giving us our 
full share of north winds, which it generally deals out 
very liberally to the inhabitants of the Highlands. It is 
now about half-past nine, and we are obliged to go to bed 
at ten. You must, therefore, allow me to come to a 
conclusion, wishing you at the same time to give my best 
love to all the family when you next write home. Do 
not fail to write soon.

Your affectionate brother,
