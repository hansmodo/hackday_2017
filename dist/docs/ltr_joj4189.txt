Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On reading your interesting letter of the 19th January, 
I observed, with particular pleasure, from the manner and 
matter of it, that, notwithstanding the winter of life, and 
snow falling on your head, you endure like an evergreen. 
</p><p>
Your impression that " we should, ere long, have peace" 
has been verified. If I remember right, you had heretofore an impression that Spain, although her case was apparently desperate, would get safe through her danger ; 
and so it came to pass. Events having justified both these 
impressions or opinions, I wish you may have another, viz. 
that the peace will terminate the delusion which caused the 
war. Several considerations incline me to expect that the 
peace will diminish it, and particularly these : 
</p><p>
Unless discontents should arise between France and 
Britain, French influence will not soon be very active in 
America ; and, consequently, will not administer much fuel 
to renew and feed a flame against England. The peace 
will deprive the delusion of the sustenance it derived from 
the patronage which the war create I. 
</p><p>
The abandonment of the professed objects of the war, 
and that without compensation either in fact or expectation — the manifest incapacity and profusion with which the 
war has been conducted — the attempts to force supplies of 
men and money by conscription, &c. — and the immense 
debt incurred and to be paid, without any value received — 
all tend to withdraw confidence and good-will from our 
political projectors ; nor can the continuance and operation 
of war-taxes be congenial with the feelings of a people who, 
if pagans, would dedicate more temples to Plutus than to 
Minerva. 
</p><p>
These, and the like facts and considerations, will doubtless have the most weight with that portion of the community who have been misled, but who really mean well. 
They will probably have some effect also on the more considerate of the others. As to the position, that " the people 
always mean well," or, in other words, that they always 
mean to say and to do what they believe to be right and 
just, — it may be popular, but it cannot be true. The word 
])coj)lc, you know, applies to all the individual inhabitants 
of a country, collectively considered. That portion of 
them who individually mean well, never was, nor until the 
millennium will be, considerable. We have not heard of 
any country, in which the great mass of the inhabitants 
individually and habitually adhere to the dictates of 
their consciences. We know how well demagogues and 
pharisaical patriots mean. Having much of the wisdom of 
this world, and little of that of the other, they will, like 
their great predecessor Absalom, always mean and act 
accordingly. 
</p><p>
Besides, <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> sometimes chastises nations with 
physical epidemics, and sometimes (by " choosing their 
delusions") with moral epidemics, and after a while removes 
them. This encourages hope ; for if we have arrived at 
or near the pessimum of this evil, the melius cannot be far 
distant. 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the book you was so kind as to 
send me. I have found some good things in it, and shall 
doubtless find more. Many of our citizens, who are more 
than mere farmers, have of late years improved our agriculture. Would not a good American edition of Columella 
be acceptable to them ? It gratifies curiosity, by showing 
the state of agriculture at a remote period ; and, on several 
topics, affords information which will be useful at any period 
</p><p>
I am glad you escaped and recovered so well from the 
accident you mention. Kentucky racers, both literal and 
figurative, will, it seems, have their capers. It would be 
no loss to the public, if some of them were at the plou^li 
Seek for " some honest, sober beast, that full softly treads," 
and will not mar your meditations. 
Adieu, my dear sir. 
</p><p>
Yours, affectionately, 
</p><p>
