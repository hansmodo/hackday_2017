Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
At and for some time after the arrival of your kind and friendly letter by Mr. Taylor, official business obliged me to postpone writing the letters due 
to my private correspondents. In December, a young man, under the influence of more important advisers, made an attack in the papers, which rendered the 
publication of my correspondence with him expedient. The first edition being replete with errors of the press, a second became indispensable ; and, from the 
moment of the attack, I concluded to delay answering your letter until I could transmit with it a proper state of facts. A new edition has just been completed, and I have the honor of inclosing a copy of 
it with this. 
</p><p>
Now, my dear Sir, let me tell you, and very sincerely, that no letter since my return has given me more pleasure than yours. As civilities, like true and 
counterfeit coins, are sometimes difficult to distinguish, and as commendation, having no intrinsic value, borrows the chief of its worth from the merit 
of those who bestow it, I feel, on this occasion, all the satisfaction which can result from approbation 
under the most advantageous circumstances. An apprehension that this letter may not reach the post-office in time, presses me not to enlarge at present. 
Mrs. Jay, whose best wishes you enjoy, desires me to tell you so, and, with me, requests the favor of you to present the like to Mrs. Washington. 
</p><p>
With perfect esteem and attachment, I am, &c., 
</p><p>
John Jay.
