<a rel='month origin' value='2'>February</a> <a rel='day origin' value='23'>23d</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=lincolnton' rel='city origin'>LINCOLNTON</a>, N. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1865' rel="origin">1865</a>]. I want to get to Kate, I am so utterly heart-broken. I hope John Chesnut and General Chesnut 
may at least get into the same army. We seem scattered over the face of the earth. Isabella sits there calmly reading. I have quieted down after the day's rampage. May our heavenly Father look down on us and have pity.

They say I was the last refugee from Columbia who was allowed to enter by the door of the cars. The government 
took possession then and women could only be smuggled in by the windows. Stout ones stuck and had to be pushed, 
pulled, and hauled in by main force. Dear Mrs. Izard, with all her dignity, was subjected to this rough treatment. 
She was found almost too much for the size of the car windows.
