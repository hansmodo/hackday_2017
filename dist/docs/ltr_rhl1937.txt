SIR Your general humanity deserves the esteem of all; but permit me to say, sir, that your particular kindness to Americans claims their reverence and gratitude. When, therefore, my brother, Dr. Lee, informed 
me that you wished to have some wine from our native grape, I lost no time in procuring the best for you. Captain Johnson will deliver you a small cask, together 
with a few bottles of older wine. The first is of last year's vintage, and that in bottles is several years old. This wine is, at present, of the true flavour of our grape, 
and is very gently acid, a quality natural to this fruit. I wish the season, and the heat of the tobacco load, may not injure it. 
</p><p>
I am, with very singular esteem, sir, your most humble and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
