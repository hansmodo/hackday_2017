<p>
TO M. DE ROCHAMBEAU.
</p><p>
Camp, August 18th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1780">1780</a>.
</p><p>
Having written, sir, one letter to you in common with the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdt' rel='co-worker'>Chevalier De Ternay</a>, permit me to address myself to you with the frankness
authorised by the warm affection I have felt, and endeavoured to prove
to you, from my earliest youth. Although your letter expresses your
usual kindness for me, I observed a few sentences in it which, without
being individually applied to me, prove to me that my last epistle
displeased you. After having been engaged night and day for four
months, in preparing the minds of the people to receive, respect, and
love you; after all I have said to make them sensible of the advantages
they derived from your residence at Rhode Island, and after having made
use of my own popularity to propagate this truth; in short, sir, after
all that my patriotism and affection for you have dictated to me, my
feelings were unavoidably hurt by your giving such an unfavourable turn
to my letter, and one which had never for a moment occurred to myself.
If in that letter I have offended or displeased you; if, for example,
you disapprove of that written account which <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>General Washington</a> asked
for, and which I thought I ought to submit to you, I give you my word
of honour that I thought I was doing a very simple thing; so simple,
indeed, that I should have considered I was wronging you by not doing
it.
</p><p>
If you had heard that second division spoken of, sir, as I have done;
if you knew how strongly the English and the Tories endeavour to
persuade the Americans that France only wishes to kindle, without
extinguishing the flame, you would readily conceive that my desire of
silencing those reports might have inspired me, perhaps, with too much
warmth. I will confide to you that, thus placed in a foreign country,
my self love is wounded by seeing the French blockaded at Rhode Island,
and the pain I feel induces me to wish the operations to commence. As
to what you write to me, sir, respecting Rhode Island, if I were to
give you an account of all I have said, written, and inserted in the
public papers; if you had heard me, frequently in the midst of a group
of American peasants, relating the conduct of the French at Newport; if
you were only to pass three days here with me, you would see the
injustice of your reproach.
</p><p>
If I have offended you, I ask your pardon, for two reasons; first,
because I am sincerely attached to you; and secondly, because it is my
earnest wish to do everything I can to please you here. As a private
individual, in all places your commands will ever be laws to me, and
for the meanest Frenchmen here I would make every possible sacrifice
rather than not contribute to their glory, comfort, and union with the
Americans. Such, sir, are my feelings, and although you have imagined
some which are very foreign to my heart, I forget that injustice to
think only of my sincere attachment to you.
</p><p>
P.S. I am far from thinking, sir, that I am in any degree the cause of
the sentiments that are experienced in this country for yourself and
the officers of your army. I am not so vain as to have entertained such
an idea; but I have had the advantage of knowing you, and I was,
therefore, able to foresee what would occur on your arrival, and to
circulate the opinions adopted by all those who have personally known
you. I am convinced, and no one here can deny it, that but for your
arrival, American affairs would have gone on badly this campaign; but,
in our present situation, this alone is not sufficient, and it is
important to gain advantages over the enemy. Believe, that when I wrote
in _my own name_, that opinion did not belong to myself alone; my only
fault was writing with warmth, in an official manner, that which you
would have forgiven on account of my youth, if I had addressed it as a
friend to yourself alone; but my intentions were so pure, that I was as
much surprised as pained by your letter, and that is saying a great
deal.
