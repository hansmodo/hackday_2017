GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
I have just received your favour of February 20, directed 
to Mr. Jackson and myself, containing instructions for our 
conduct relating to the application for a repeal of the duty 
act, to the change of government, and to the legal tender of 
paper money ; which instructions we shall observe to the best 
of our abilities. Mr. Jackson has read your letter, and is 
now reading the messages and other papers transmitted to 
us, which we shall lay before the secretaries of state on Monday, and thereupon press the necessity of a change in the 
administration of our province. 
</p><p>
The Parliament will have a short session, it is said, in May, 
when, if any application is made for the repeal of that act, 
by the agents of the other colonies, we shall join them heartily, 
and do what we can likewise in the affair of paper money. 
In the mean time, should an Indian war make it necessary to 
emit paper money with a legal tender, it may be considered 
how far the fourth clause in the act of the 24 Geo. II. might 
give countenance to your providing in that way for the 
emergency; that act not being altered or repealed by any 
later, it seems as if the Parliament thought that clause not 
improper, though they have not expressly made the same 
provision for the other colonies. The mail being to go this 
evening, I can only add, that I am with the utmost respect 
for you and the Assembly, Gentlemen, your most obedient 
and most humble servant, B. FRANKLIN.
