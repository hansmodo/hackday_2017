Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been here a month, and well only two days. I 
came in quest of health, but " seek ami you shall find" does 
not, it seems, always extend to that of the body.

The parliament is sitting. The king's speech and its 
echoes you will see in the papers. I have not had any 
conversation on politics with either of the ministers. In 
my opinion, no plan or system of conduct respecting America is yet decided upon by the cabinet, in which the jarring 
principles of whig and tory still strive and ferment. The 
latter persuade themselves that we shall not be able to act 
as a nation, that our governments are too feeble to command 
respect, and our credit too much abased to recover its 
reputation, or merit confidence. I hope better things. We 
are not without friends in tins country, but they have more 
inclination than power to be friendly. We have also enemies, and bitter ones. If we act wisely and unitedly, we 
have nothing to fear. It is in our power finally to make a 
navigation act, and prevent British vessels carrying our productions ; provided we should execute it, we would find 
it of as much value as many treaties of commerce. Let 
us act, however, with temper ; it is more easy to make 
sores than to heal them. But if Britain should adopt and 
persist in a monopolizing system, let us retaliate fully and 
firmly. This nation, like many others, is influenced more 
by its feelings than reasonings. I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend and servant, 
</p><p>
