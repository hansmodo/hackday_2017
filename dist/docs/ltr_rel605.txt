<p><i>[Biographer's note: This was the first final examination at Washington College since my
father became its president.  He worked very hard, and was kept busy
attending to all the details and the putting into practice of several
new methods and systems he had introduced.</i>

That summer he took my mother to the Rockbridge Baths, about eleven
miles from Lexington, to give her the benefit of the waters, which,
he hoped, might give her some relief from the continual pain she
suffered.  She did derive benefit, but, unfortunately, had a fall which
seriously impeded the improvement.  In reply to a note from my mother
telling him of her misfortune and asking him to send her some medicines,
he writes the following note: ]</i></p>

My Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse met">Mary:</a>  On receiving your note, yesterday, I had only time to
get the arnica and send it by the stage.  I am very sorry that you
received such a fall, and fear it must have been a heavy shock to you.
I am, however, very thankful that you escaped greater injury, and
hope it is no worse than you describe.  I will endeavour to get down
to see you to-morrow evening, and trust I may find you somewhat relieved
from its effects.  We are pretty well here.  Many people are out of
town, and I have not seen those who are in.  Love to the girls.
</p><p>
                  Truly and affectionately yours,
