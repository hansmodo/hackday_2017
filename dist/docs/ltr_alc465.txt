Dear Friend:-
</p><p>
   Yours of the 19th inst. was received in due
time, I was sorry to hear that you were not well, but I
hope that you are now stout and hearty, enjoying the
pleasures of a beautiful country home. I know not
whether you would prefer a town life to one in the
country, but if you lived in town awhile and had
nothing to do, you would realize the truth of that
saying, that "nothing to do" is the hardest work that
one can engage in. I hope you will take care of that
and always manage to have something to do, for chil-
dren learn mischief when they learn nothing else.
</p><p>
    You will excuse me for reminding me of the value
of health, but my object is to put you on your guard
that you may not, by unnecessary means, impare or
injure your health, for it is one of the greatest gifts
conferred upon a man by a bountiful Creator, a gift
which few enjoy, and which a still less number try
to preserve, how much less suffering would there
be in the world if people would regard their health in the proper light, The only possible excuse
that could be advanced for one's neglecting his health[illeg.]
would, I suppose be, that Dr.s. must live too,
He who loses his health, by abusing it, will then for
the first time discover that he has forfeited [ it to]
all his claims to unalloyed and perfect happines.
Now as you and I are yet young and healthy,
let us resolve [ that] our health shall claim its share of
attention, -- that we will ever strive to preserve and
maintain it as long as it is the will of our Maker
to do so.
</p><p>
   The war is not over yet, -- the difficulties remain
unsettled -- the traitors still live to plot our destruction
yea: it is just beginning to assume its destructive form
the defeat at Manassas Junction, and the cruel manner
in which our wounded heroes were treated will forever
remain on the pages of history as a living testimony against
the humanity of the slave drivers of the South, when
the people of the North [ once] suffer the cruelties which the
south chooses [ to] inflict -- when his life depends on the
sympathy of a southerner, he will say "the half
was not told us of [ the] inhumanity of this people" 

no, the war is not ended yet, we permitted the south
to inflict upon a poor and helpless race of Gods creatures
the most unjust tortures that was [ ever] heaped upon
any race of human beings, and now we are to be asked to
do just what rational beings might have expected
to bow down on our knees [ before them] , that a like burthen
may be placed upon our shoulders, but will we do it;
will we as freeman succumb to their unjust demands &
will we sacrifice ourselves and our children to the
everlasting curse of slavedom? No, but we will
cheerfully sacrifice our all upon the alter of our Country
and stand by the Constitution and the laws until the
last drop of our hear's blood shall have oozed from [ our]
bosoms, not as long as we inherit the spirit by which
our fathers were actuated [ can we] shrink from the task
before us, nor can [ we,] until that spirit shall have
been entirely annihilated, yield to the mandate of
that notaious traitor Jeff. not until we have
lost everything that is noble in man, can we
consent to the destruction of the government,
which would be nothing less than our own destruction.
No the war is not ended yet, the fighting is yet to do, and Virginia will become a free
state, and slavery will gradually die out, and
how is this to be done? Why I will tell you
our troops will take Virginia -- occupy it, -- and then
the secessionists will have to leave to escape being
imprisoned for treason, and then western Virginia will
extend her government over the whole dominion
and abolish slavery herself, because the non-
slaveholders will carry the elections, and after Virginia
becomes a free state and presents to the other southern
states her advantage gained by freedom and their dis-
advantage incured by the curse of slavery they will
gradually one after the other become free, and those
who live to see it will behold the whole union
cemented together by bonds of common
interest and brotherhood, this is my opinion
of the result of this war.
</p><p>
    I am getting along with study old fashioned
and have some hopes of getting home before long,
wishing you success in your efforts to get
a birth of school teaching.
</p><p>
I remain your,<br/>
true friend
</p>
