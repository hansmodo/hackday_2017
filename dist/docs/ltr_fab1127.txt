WEAVERVILLE, June 9, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1852">1852</a>

I have settled down once more and intend to stay settled if the town I have selected does not die out as a great many places do in this mushroom country, but I suppose the locality of this place is unknown to you. Look on the map and find Shasta. On the head waters of the Sacramento and forty miles north, ten miles from Trinity River, is Weaverville. It is situated in a beautiful valley, surrounded by mountains. Those on the north are still covered with snow. This is the best mining country in California as the dirt all pays from the surface in most places.
</p><p>
The town contains about forty buildings and 1200 inhabitants in the vicinity. We have rented a good store and arrived with our goods last week. It costs 13¢ per lb
to get goods here from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=sacramento">Sacramento City</a>, 150 miles by steamboat, 275 by wagon and 40 on the backs of mules. Articles are not quite as cheap as in Bucksport, but we board for $15 per week. Our trade is better than I expected and think we shall do well. We started on what we got for our house in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=sacramento">Sacramento City</a>, $2000, and of course had to begin small; but we have already sold quite an amount of goods and Cole goes down today for more. So now you know what I am doing and what I intend to do for the next two years, if nothing extraordinary takes place. At the expiration of that time my five years will be up. If successful I shall certainly come home. If not, I shall probably get entirely disgusted with trying to make money and emigrate to Mexico or the Marquesas.

I have spent three weeks in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> and three in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=sacramento">Sacramento City</a> since I wrote you. I dressed myself up, mingled in all the gaieties and some of the dissipations of these cities and without being extravagant, spent enough money to keep up with those whose company I kept. I don't want you to understand that I prefer bad company. I like to see all kinds of life and human nature but I really prefer sensible and respectable companions to low and vicious ones, and it has always been my aim to move in the highest society and if I am ever able to do as I like I shall. I shall be aristocratic to a certainty, but I am democratic enough now. However, I possess a contented mind, which as the actor says 'is a wall of brass.'

Speaking of this, I took some real pleasure in visiting the theatres. This I consider a sensible amusement. Madame Biscaliante carried me back in imagination to the Opera House at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a> and I spent two delightful evenings (and three dollars) in listening to her.

Kirk and I enjoyed many pleasant evenings together. You need not be afraid for him. He has a love for money and not much taste for those revels and blow outs that
young men too often indulge in. Charley Robinson is a little faster but by no means dissipated. He is doing well at his business. John Benson has become rich speculating and living easy and is, withal, a great ladies man.
</p><p>
On our way up we pass through Colusa, on the Sacramento River. Here we leave the steamboat and take the stage. This is the loveliest spot in California. The prairies at this season were covered with flowers. The town is built under the large oaks and is completely shaded. There is a large rancheria of Indians here and, in fact, there are more Indians than whites in the place. The weather was awfully hot and I was very strongly reminded of the Islands, to see the whole tribe in swimming in the river, and example we followed as it was the only way to keep cool. In the afternoon we had a horse race and 'there was a sound of revelry by night.' Music arose from the rancheria and we lit our cigars and strolled out to see what was the row. We found out that there was a wedding going on.
</p><p>
The evening was fine, with a full moon, and seated around in a circle were one or two hundred Indians with goose wings in their hands to keep time with. The leader gave a grand flourish with his wing and then sang a solo. Then with another grand flourish, he brought in the whole chorus. They kept good time and made no discords and the effect was not bad. After singing sometime there was a loud call for cheunnek (food) and large baskets of acorn bread and dried salmon were emptied. Then another concert.

At twelve I went to bed and the last sound I heard was the sacred order, for it sounded like 'chevova.' These are the best specimens of the Diggers to be seen in the country. They are all clothed and the men work discharging the boats and the girls are employed as servants in the
</p><p>
Public Houses and they do first-rate. At Hall's Ranch they wait on the table and are clean and neat...ask you whether you will have tea or coffee. The Mountain Diggers are another race, perfectly wild and untamable. You never see one and war to the knife exists between them and the whites. They waylay and murder all they can and the whites shoot every Indian that shows himself. A short time ago they killed a Mr. Anderson from this place, close by town. A party of men went out, discovered the rancheria, surrounded it and killed 140 Indians. They brought in one squaw and a little boy. Their destiny is to be exterminated.

Write me a long letter now and direct to Shasta and now that I am settled down I will resume my regular correspondence, provided always you keep up your end.
