DEAR SIR : <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, May 6th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1794">1794</a>. 
</p><p>
Mr. [Ebenezer] Dorr obtained a passage in the vessel with 
Mr. Jay, and Mr. [Edward] Jones had an opportunity to go 
from Newport, so that they had no occasion to make the 
application to Congress in behalf of which I requested your 
favor. 
</p><p>
I drew another petition some time since for the manufacturers of snuff and tobacco in this town, making representations against the tax proposed upon those articles. I know 
not whether you have seen this petition, or in what light it 
appeared if you did. In the House of Representatives I 
believe it was not read, and the tax I understand has passed. 
I was somewhat puzzled for reasons to suggest against it. 
</p><p>
The session of Congress I presume is approaching to a 
close. The prospects of immediate war appear to blow over. 
Whether we shall be able to make any terms of accommodation with Great Britain and obtain proper satisfaction for 
her insolence and violence, is still very questionable, but it is of infinite importance that we should preserve peace, until war shall become a duty. 
</p><p>
It is therefore fortunate for the country that the passionate measures which have been proposed were all defeated. 
That for the suspension of intercourse with Great Britain 
was one of the most important of them. Your decision of 
that question probably gave the tone to our affairs for one season further. The fate of this country depended upon 
that vote. I expected it would have renewed the abusive 
system which was for some time so rancorously pursued, but 
which for some time past has drooped away. But very 
little has been said upon the subject, and I have not seen a 
single speculation in the prints upon it. 
</p><p>
The cessation of the embargo is offensive to our Jacobins, 
who are reduced to the argument, that either the Congress 
were precipitate in laying it on, or imprudent in taking it 
off. I have silenced some of them by avowing the former 
as my opinion. 
</p><p>
You have seen the operation of democratic clubs in this 
town by the dismission of Mr. Jones and the election of Mr. 
Morton as representative. Morton has of late been a 
violent sans-culotte, and faction covers at least as great a 
multitude of sins as charity. 
</p><p>
The opposite party have not so much industry and have 
not the advantage of an organized system. Otis had about 
200 votes but did not obtain his election. Jarvis was formerly his warm political friend, and probably viewed him as 
a disciple of his own ; but finding him intractable and rather 
falling into the other scales, he has forsaken him, and of 
course carried off a powerful interest. Jarvis's electioneering 
influence in this town is very great. . . .
