Sir, 
</p><p>
By the inclosed act, you will readily discover that 
the Assembly are alarmed at the storms which threaten the United States. What our enemies have foretold, seems to be hastening to its accomplishment ; 
and cannot be frustrated but by an instantaneous, 
zealous, and steady union among the friends of the 
Federal Government. To you I need not press our 
present dangers. The inefficiency of Congress you 
have often felt in your official character ; the increasing languor of our associated Republics you hourly 
see ; and a dissolution would be, I know, to you a 
source of the deepest mortification. 
</p><p>
I freely, then, entreat you to accept the unanimous 
appointment of the General Assembly to the Convention at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. For the gloomy prospect still 
admits one ray of hope ; that those who began, carried on, and consummated the revolution, can yet 
rescue America from the impending ruin. 
</p><p>
I have the honor. Sir, to be, with the sincerest 
esteem and respect, yours, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=edr" rel="me">Edmund Randolph</a>.
