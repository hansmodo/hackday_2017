                                       Richmond, March 14, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1862">1862</a>.

My Dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="spouse sweetheart met">Mary</a>:  I have been trying all the week to write to you, but
have not been able.  I have been placed on duty here to conduct
operations under the direction of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jed" rel="colleague met">President</a>.  It will give me great
pleasure to do anything I can to relieve him and serve the country,
but I do not see either advantage or pleasure in my duties.  But I
will not complain, but do my best.  I do not see at present either
that it will enable me to see much more of you.  In the present
condition of affairs no one can foresee what may happen, nor in my
judgement is it advisable for any one to make arrangements with a
view to permanency or pleasure.  The presence of some one at the
White House is necessary as long as practicable.  How long it will
be  practicable for you an Charlotte to remain there I cannot say.
The enemy is pushing us back in all directions, and how far he will
be successful depends much upon our efforts and the mercy of Providence.
I shall, in all human probability, soon have to take the field, so
for the present I think things had better remain as they are.  Write
me your views.  If you think it best for you to come to Richmond I
can soon make arrangements for your comfort and shall be very glad
of your company and presence.  We have experienced a great affliction
both in our private and public relations.  Our good and noble Bishop
Meade died last night.  He was very anxious to see you, sent you his
love and kindest remembrances, and had I known in time yesterday I
should have sent expressly for you to come up.  But I did not know
of his wish or condition till after the departure of the cars yesterday.
Between 6 and 7 P. M. yesterday he sent for me, said he wished to
bid me good-bye, and to give me his blessing, which he did in the
most affecting manner.  Called me Robert and reverted to the time
I used to say the catechism to him.  He invoked the blessing of God
upon me and the country.  He spoke with difficulty and pain, but was
perfectly calm and clear.  His hand was then cold and pulseless, yet
he shook mine warmly.  'I ne'er shall look upon his like again.'  He
died during the night.  I presume the papers of to-morrow will tell
you all....

                         Very truly and sincerely,
