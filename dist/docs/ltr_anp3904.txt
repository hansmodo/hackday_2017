SIR: 
</p><p>
I wrote you a few days ago to reinforce <a href='/results.php?tla=jaw' rel='colleague'>Colonel Williams</a> at NinetySix with twenty-five men from your company; but, as I have just got 
orders from Gen. Williamson to march a strong party of my regiment 
to Cowan's Ferry, on <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> river, you will, therefore, march with 
two parts of your company to that place, to be there on Wednesday 
next, the 17th inst., armed and accoutred, with good horses. I have 
wrote to <a href='/results.php?tla=jaw' rel='colleague'>Col. Williams</a> to let your men come home, though you had 
better see him yourself. I hope you will be spirited in this matter. 
I am, sir, your most humble servant, 
</p><p>
