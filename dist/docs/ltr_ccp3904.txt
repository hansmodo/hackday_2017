DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
By a letter this moment received from Gen. Huger, dated the 10th 
of this month, he desires me to inform your excellency, that a Col. Perkins, a trader from Virginia, has contracted for five or six hundred head of cattle on Pee Dee and the Cheraws, and which in a few days will be drove off for Virginia, if not immediately stopped ; the consequences of such a speculation (for our commissaries have it not in their 
power to go to market with ready money) are truly alarming. 
I am your excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
