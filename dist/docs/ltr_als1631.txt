The <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=als" rel="me">President of the Mexican Republic</a> to the troops engaged in 
the Army of the United States of America. 
</p><p>
The circumstances of war have brought you to the beautiful valley of Mexico; in the midst of a wealthy and fertile country. The 
American Governement engaged you to fight against a country 
from which you have received no harm; your companions have after the battle received and shall only receive the contempt of the 
United States and the scorn of the nations of civilized Europe that, 
quite surprized, see that that governement seek engagements for 
their battles in the same manner as they look for beasts to draw 
their carriages. 
</p><p>
In the name of the Nation I represent, and whose authority 
I exercise, I offer you a reward, if deserting the American 
standard you present yourselves like friends to a nation that offer 
you rich fields and large tracts of land, which being cultivated by 
your industry, shall crown you with happiness and convenience. 
</p><p>
The Mexican Nation only look upon you as some deceived foreigners and hereby stretch out to you a friendly hand, offer you 
the felicity and fertility of their territory. Here there is no distinction of races; here indeed there is liberty and no slavery; nature 
here plentifully sheds its favors and it is in your power to enjoy 
them. Rely upon what I offer you in the name of a nation; present yourselves like friends and you shall have country, home, 
lands; the happiness, which is enjoyed in a country of mild and 
humane customs; civilization, humanity and not fear address you 
through me.
