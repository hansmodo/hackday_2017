Sir, 
</p><p>
I arrived here the 25th of March. At that time 
things were in greater confusion than can well be 
conceived. The country people were, to all appearance, in a fit of frenzy. About three hundred had 
just returned from the Moravian towns, where they 
found about ninety men, women, and children, all of 
whom they put to death, it is said, after cool deliberation, and considering the matter for three days. 
The whole were collected into their church, and tied 
when singing hymns. On their return, a party came 
and attacked a few Delaware Indians, who have yet remained with us, on a small island close by this 
garrison, killed two who had Captain's commissions in 
our service, and several others ; the remainder effected 
their escape into the fort, except two who ran to the 
woods, and have not since been heard of. There was 
an officer's guard on the island at the same time, but 
he either did not do his duty, or his men connived 
at the thing; which, I am not yet able to ascertain. 
This last outrage was committed the day before 1 
arrived ; nothing of this nature has been attempted since. 
</p><p>
A number of wrong-headed men had conceived an 
opinion, that Colonel Gibson was a friend to Indians, 
and that he must be killed also. These transactions, 
added to the then mutinous disposition of the regular 
troops, had nearly brought on the loss of this whole 
country. I am confident, if this post was evacuated, 
the bounds of Canada would be extended to the Laurel Hill in a few weeks. I have the pleasure, however, to inform your Excellency that things now 
wear a more favorable aspect. The troops are again 
reduced to obedience, and I have had a meeting, or 
Convention, of the County Lieutenants and several 
Field-Officers, with whom I have made arrangements 
for defending their frontiers, and who promise to exert themselves in drawing out the militia, agreeably 
to law, on my requisitions. The few remaining Indians, chiefly women and children, are exceeding troublesome to us, as they dare not stir out of the fort ; 
not one of the warriors will even venture on a reconnoitring party. I think they would be better in 
some more interior part of the country, where they 
could be both cheaper fed and clothed. Besides, it 
is not only inconvenient, but improper, to have them 
among the troops, who are, without them, crowded in dirty, bad barracks. I beg your Excellency's instructions how to dispose of them. Their Chief, Killbuck, 
has a son and brother at <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a> College, whom he 
is anxious to see. 
</p><p>
Captain Springer, of the Virginia line, marched, 
some time since, with three Indians and as many 
white men, towards Sandusky, for the purpose of 
gaining intelligence ; but the Indians proved too timid 
for him to venture to go all the way. He of course 
returned, without being able to accomplish any thing. 
I thought it too great a risk, but it was by his request, and that of the Indians, who were very solicitous. It was proved on one of the party, named 
Eells, that he intended betraying Captain Springer, 
and all the party, into the hands of the enemy. I 
directed a Board of Officers to inquire into his conduct, who were of opinion he should suffer death. I 
ordered him executed ; he was shot on the 12th instant, seemingly much to the satisfaction of the other 
Indians.

Civil authority is by no means properly established 
in this country, which I doubt proceeds in some degree from inattention in the Executives of Virginia 
and Pennsylvania. Not running the boundary line 
is, I think, a proof of this, which is at present an 
excuse for neglects of duty of all kinds, for at least 
twenty miles on each side of the line. More evils 
will arise from this neglect, than people are aware of 
Emigrations and New States are much talked of 
Advertisements are set up, announcing a day to assemble at Wheeling, for all who wish to become 
members of a new State on the Muskingum. A certain Mr. Johnson is at the head of this party ; he is 
ambitious, restless, and some say disaffected. Most 
people, however agree, he is open to co|ruption ; he 
has been in England since the commencement of the 
present war. ShoukI these people actually emigrate, 
they must be either entirely cut off, or immediately 
take protection from the British, which I fear is the 
real design of some of the party, though I think a 
great majority have no other views than to acquire 
lands. As I apprehended taking cognizance of these 
matters would come best from the civil authority, I 
have written to the Governors of Virginia and Pennsylvania on the subject, which I should not have 
done, till I had first acquainted your Excellency thereof, but for this consideration, namely, that the 20th 
of May is the day appointed for the emigrants to 
rendezvous ; consequently a representation from you 
would be too late, in case the States should think 
proper to take measures to prevent them. I am 
much embarrassed by the scanty and irregular supply of provision. I intend to write to <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a> on 
this head. I have the honor to be. Sir, 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,
