TO PAYNE TODD.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=montpelier" rel="city">Montpelier</a>, July 20, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1834">1834</a>.

Yours, dearest, promising to write me again, came safely, and I was glad to hear 
mine, with the inclosure, had reached you. You did not tell me whether you had been 
successful in your collections. If not, you will want supplies proportioned to your 
detention ; I am anxious that you should have them, and you know the little I have 
in my power is at your command, though but "a drop in the bucket." You will tell 
me when you intend to return, that I may have the pleasure of expecting you.

Messrs. Patton and Rives dined with us on the 1 2th; they inquired for you, and 
said they had hoped to see you at the party as a "Jackson man." General Madison came with them, looking well and 
happy. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="spouse met">Mr. Madison</a> is better, though very ill a few days since, and I now hope 
he will soon be well enough for me to leave him on an expedition to the Court House. 
It would be quite an event for me to go there, five miles from home. Our last tobacco was a failure ; it sold at seven when 
seventeen was expected; so it goes with planters. Dolly and Mary wrote me yes 
terday that you were very popular in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>, and I should like to be with 
you to witness it the respect and love shown to my son would be the highest 
gratification the world could bestow upon me. I think to inclose this to my brother 
to deliver, in case of your having left, to keep it for you, or return when you are 
at home, as I shall inclose. . . . We have seen but few strangers since you left home. 
Mr. Burney, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, called on his way to the Springs, and Mr. Randall, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, with his daughters and niece. He 
said, by the way, that he had caught a glimpse of you at the station, but lost sight of you again, as he was busy with his baggage.

I suppose you saw Madame Serurier before she went on her travels. If you can 
see Mrs. Lear, tell her she must come from the Springs to visit me. And now adieu, my dear son ; may Heaven preserve and protect you, prays 
</p><p>
Your mother, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=dol" rel="me">DOLLY P. MADISON.</a>.
