We, the Second Brigade, left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Corpus Christi" rel="city">Corpus Christi</a> at 
eight in the morning on the tenth. We parted with 
our old camping ground without regret, and cheerfully 
commenced our march over the hill. Our course was 
a little north of west, over a prairie sprinkled with 
" mots " (Mexican vernacular) of stunted timber, 
muskeet, a species of locust, and extensive fields of 
chaparral, dense thorny thickets, perfectly impenetrable. After marching about eight miles the Nueces 
was seen on our right, winding through the prairie 
like a blue ribbon carelessly thrown on a green robe. 
The prairie was covered with flowers such as bloom at 
the North during the summer. I observed in great 
abundance the spiderwort, phlox, lupin, fireplant 
lobelia inflata, primrose, etc., indeed, most of the 
common flowers of the Northern prairies. The day 
was hot though cloudy with a pleasant breeze. Our 
weather would be like the July of your region, were 
we not relieved of its sultriness by the tail of the south 
east trade, which blows upon us steadily at this season. 
We made twelve miles and encamped on the right 
bank of the Nueces about four o clock. Among the 
flowers I ought to mention the Spanish bayonet now 
in full bloom. The plant towers to a gigantic size, the 
shaft or body like the palmetto running up some ten 
or fifteen feet, from six to ten inches in diameter, 
crowded with a cluster of glossy green bayonets radiating in every direction from the centre of which, and 
towering several feet above all, is a glorious pyramid 
of white flowers hanging in clusters or lateral branches 
from the main stem. These are visible for many miles 
on the open prairie, and appear precisely like ships in 
the distance, or when near a mot like a tall lighthouse 
on some wooded headland. I was on guard last eve 
ning and sat up nearly all night. About daylight it 
began to rain. We broke up our camp at sunrise and 
were en route by seven. After marching two hours 
west our course turned to the southwest, to avoid 
marshes about the head waters of streams emptying 
into the Gulf. We marched for miles over a muddy 
prairie almost impassable for our baggage train. I 
had command of the advance guard and saw much 
game, deer innumerable, geese, ducks, curlew, cranes, 
wild turkeys, etc. Made fourteen miles and encamped 
at Agua Dulce (sweet water) . It was a very fatiguing 
day to the command, and the baggage train was not 
all up until night, though we were in camp at five 
o clock. Here an express was received from General 
Worth, who had left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Corpus Christi" rel="city">Corpus Christi</a> one day in ad 
vance of us, stating that he was but four miles away, 
and that we would have much difficulty in crossing the 
marshes next day. Our camp was delightfully situated 
on a gentle slope towards the water, the evening 
was pleasant, the moon at full. I took a refreshing 
bath and felt as good as new. Our camp was, however, 
full of " varmints." From one hole a rabbit, a rat, 
a rattle snake, and a tarantula were dislodged, these 
animals, incredible as it may appear, living in common in the same den. I killed with my sword, immediately in rear of my tent, a huge rattler nearly 
six feet in length. We proceeded on our weary march 
at seven in the morning. It rained until eleven o clock, 
after which the weather was fine and cool. After 
passing the camp of the First Brigade, the road was 
good, and all proceeded smoothly. After marching 
eleven miles, we encamped seven miles from the depot 
on the San Gertrude. 
</p><p>
The country we passed over was diversified with 
rich prairies, scattered wood, and chaparral and we 
saw a fine herd of antelopes and several droves of 
wild horses. On the eighteenth broke up our camp 
and marched at half -past six. The weather was exceedingly warm, and many of the officers and men 
suffered much from blistered feet. Passed the San 
Gertrude and depot at eleven o clock and encamped 
two miles beyond on a beautiful ground with good 
wood and water. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> and staff overtook 
us at this place, but soon pushed on after the Dragoons 
who were some twenty miles in advance. We re 
newed the supplies of provisions and marched on the 
morning of the fourteenth at seven. The day was 
oppressively hot, and I found I was doomed to suffer 
as I discovered I was badly poisoned. You know well 
with what severity it attacks me and how painful it is. 
Now imagine me marching in the midst of the dust of 
the army, toiling on for miles without water, under a 
fierce tropical sun, and you may have some idea what 
I encountered this day. But all things have an end 
and we pitched our tents at last near an extensive 
growth of stunted timber, live oaks, acacia in full 
bloom, and muskeet. 
</p><p>
The place is called by the Mexicans San Fernando. 
I took a bath and sat down to encounter my torments 
in sulky silence. This afternoon Mason caught a 
young antelope. How beautiful he was ! His large, 
mild eye was fixed upon us with the most beseeching 
expression. I pleaded for him and Mason had him 
restored to liberty near where he was taken. The 
weary afternoon wore away and I went to my blanket, 
but not to sleep. It seemed to me an eternity to 
reveille, but it and " the general " finally beat and 
we resumed our route which lay over a barren, sandy 
region. The day was hot, the poison much worse, my 
forehead, chin, wrists, and breasts being ulcerated 
and much swollen. We reached our camping ground 
about two, but marched and counter-marched in the 
burning sun for more than an hour before the Colonel 
had sufficiently collected his ideas to suffer us to pitch 
our tents. Several peccaries were killed near the 
camp and large droves of them seen. They are a fierce 
animal and bear about the same resemblance to a hog 
that the buffalo does to a common ox. I spent another 
night of suffering without one wink of sleep, and nearer 
dead than alive, with a feeling of perfect desperation 
I prepared to head my company. We began our march 
at half -past five, and as we moved off Major Stam 
ford s servant was sent to me with one of the Major s 
horses. I shall never cease to be grateful to him, as 
I was truly unfit to march. Our route today was over 
a sandy desert and was very hard upon the men. The 
ox-teams were not able to keep up. We made a little 
over fifteen miles, and encamped at a place called 
Filisola s Wells. Filisola was one of Santa Anna s 
generals, and commanded the rear division at the 
battle of San Jacinto. He retreated after that battle 
and tis said rested his army some days at this place. 
</p><p>
An express came to us here from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> 
announcing " The enemy is on our front, threatening 
to attack us if we advance." The rear brigades were 
ordered to push on with as much dispatch as possible 
and join the advance of the army. We were all much 
excited and forgot our fatigues and sufferings and 
discussed our prospects around our camp fires. The 
enemy were reported to be four thousand, we were but 
three thousand, yet should we meet them we felt the 
utmost confidence that we should beat them. I got 
some sleep this night and rose much refreshed at two 
in the morning when our reveille sounded. We were 
off at four o clock, I being still mounted on the Major s 
horse. 
</p><p>
We made this day a long march over a perfect desert, 
the scanty herbage having been burnt by the enemy. 
The only water we saw was salt and the sun streamed 
upon us like living fire. We were all day enveloped in 
clouds of black sooty dust and ashes, which adhered 
to our beards and skins moist with perspiration making us look like so many dirty negroes, and when late 
in the afternoon we halted at a muddy pool of brackish 
water, our very wives would not have known us ! 
We made today between seventeen and eighteen miles 
all much fatigued, but after washing and getting a cup 
of tea our cheerfulness was restored. The sixteenth 
we started at seven in the morning, the rear of our 
baggage train with the rear guard still many miles 
behind. The soil and country today rapidly improved and we encamped early on a rich prairie, 
surrounded by pleasant woods. Directly in front of 
our camp was a pond of clear sweet water. Oh ! how 
we did drink and bathe ! I never knew before how 
good water could be after being without it thirty-six 
hours. We saw many wild bulls, and a magnificent 
mustang attracted by our horses ventured up to the 
very chain of sentinels. He was glossy black with fine 
muscular proportions, and looked worthy to bear a 
hero through a battle charge, as he stood with expanded nostrils and dilating eye gazing upon the 
strange sight before him. An effort was made to take 
him with the lasso, but he distanced our fleetest horses 
and returned again and again to gaze upon the strange 
array which had invaded his native wilds. 
I mounted guard with two subalterns and eighty 
men. The guard tents being still in the rear we 
bivouacked in front of the camp. On the nineteenth 
we made eleven miles through a fine country, no want 
of water and plenty of game. We heard the drums of 
the First Brigade at tattoo and had a most interest 
ing dispatch from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> stating that the 
enemy were in force at the crossing of the Arroyo 
Colorado seven miles ahead, and that he should force 
the ford as soon as we came up. All our teams reached 
us in the night and we started at seven in the morning. 
</p><p>
At eight we came up with the baggage train of the 
First Brigade which was parked and guarded to await 
the termination of the expected battle. At a quarter 
past nine we deployed on the right of the First Brigade 
in order of battle, immediately on the bank of the 
Arroyo Colorado. For the last two miles before we 
reached the river we met staff officers, men and camp 
followers riding to the rear, all with eager, anxious 
faces, all telling the same tale, that the Mexicans 
were in force on the opposite bank. As we deployed 
we saw a few Mexican ranchereros (militia) and lancers in the edge of the bushes on the other side. We 
heard, too, from the staff officers that the Mexican 
Adjutant- General and a Colonel Kintaro had been 
with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> and had pledged their honor as 
soldiers that they would fire upon the first man of 
our army who should attempt to cross the ford, that 
such were the orders from General Mejia and that 
they were supported by a strong force. They were 
fully believed as bugles were sounding the advance in 
various directions on their side, and troops and horse 
men were showing themselves at many points on the 
bank as if parts of a strong body deployed in order of 
battle. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> had replied to the Mexican 
officers that in fifteen minutes he should force the 
passage and that his batteries would open on any one 
who should oppose themselves to it. Then, immediately ordering his horse, the Mexican officers retired. 
This was perhaps one of the most exciting hours of 
my life. All, from the General-in-Chief to the smallest 
drummer boy, felt morally certain that we were on the 
verge of a fierce and bloody conflict, yet I saw no one 
who was not cheerful and apparently eager for the 
game to begin. 
</p><p>
The river at the ford is about eighty yards in width, 
and four feet in depth. The banks, I judged, about 
fifteen feet in height, the crest on the Mexican side 
covered with wood and a thick undergrowth, on ours, 
an open field with a wood in our rear. The movement 
was begun at half-past ten, by four companies of the 
Second Brigade under the command of Captain C. F. 
Smith, who by the right flank and in perfect order 
marched into the water. As they struck the margin, 
General Worth rushed to the head of the column to 
lead the charge. We watched them in breathless 
silence as they deepened in the water expecting that 
at every step they would receive a withering fire. 
When they were half way over and not a shot fired 
the disappointment of the men was shown from right 
to left in muttered curses. A squadron of Dragoons 
followed immediately in rear of Captain C. F. Smith s 
command and the entire army marched over rapidly, 
reaching the opposite bank in thirty minutes from 
the order to move. As the head of the column reached 
the shore, the men with cheers formed in order of 
battle, the music struck up " Yankee Doodle," and 
we all marched rapidly up the hill. A few Mexicans 
were seen retreating, and the great battle of Arroyo 
Colorado was terminated ! 
</p><p>
The Mexican threats were all gasconade intended 
to intimidate <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> and delay our advance 
upon <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a>. We encamped about three miles 
from the river to await the arrival of our baggage 
train and the Third Brigade which was still a day s 
march in the rear. If you consider the tale " all cry 
and no wool," I can only say it was interesting to us 
although the yellow gentlemen completely pulled 
the wool over our eyes. The Third Brigade came up 
about three o clock in the afternoon and we waited 
another day for the train to arrive. 
</p><p>
On the twenty-third at sunrise we broke up our 
camp and moved in four columns in the direction of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a>, twenty-eight miles distant. The day 
was oppressively hot, our march rapid, and I had not 
been so much exhausted at any time as when a short 
halt was called a little after noon by the side of a 
muddy pond. We presented today an imposing 
spectacle as we moved in parallel columns across the 
open prairie, with our long baggage train close in our 
rear and our scouts far in advance and on our flanks 
examining every thicket. A thousand rumors were 
in the mouths of our newsmongers, of forces in our 
front ready to eat us without pepper or salt. We 
made twelve miles and encamped just before sunset 
in a deep ravine which in high water is one of the out 
lets of the Rio Grande. The country was beautiful 
during the whole day, the ground clothed with flowers 
which at the North are rare exotics. Many varieties 
of cactus were budding and blossoming around us, 
from the giant prickly pear to a diminutive little fellow 
just poking his thorny nose through the soil crowned 
with a brilliant blossom. I know the names of but few 
of this numerous family. The Turk s head is perhaps 
the most beautiful we have seen, presenting a semi-sphere only above the ground the size of a tolerably 
large watermelon while on the apex is a crown of 
brilliant feather-petalled blossoms. 
</p><p>
On the twenty-fourth we moved in the same order 
as on the previous day until we crossed the road from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a> to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Point Isabel" rel="city">Point Isabel</a>, at a place as we supposed 
about nine miles from the Point and eighteen from 
the city. Here <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="colleague">General Taylor</a> with the Dragoons 
and a battery of artillery left us for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Point Isabel" rel="city">Point Isabel</a> where 
he expected to find our munitions, etc., with a few 
siege pieces and mortars expected by water. General 
Worth moved the three brigades five miles towards 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Matamoras" rel="city">Matamoras</a> and encamped.
