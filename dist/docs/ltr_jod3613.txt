MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YESTERDAY I came to the Senate, as usual on a Monday morning pleasing my imagination and my heart 
with the hope and expectation of a letter from 
my dearest friend. No letter for the Vice President! 
says Matthew. 
</p><p>
All day in bad humor. Dirty weather wet walking nothing good nothing right. 
</p><p>
The poor post offices did not escape. It was some 
blunder some carelessness of theirs in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, or <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>.

Or perhaps mam is sick Oh dear! Rheumatisms Oh dear ! Fever and ague ! Thus peevishly, fretfully, and unphilosophically, was yesterday 
passed. Yet, to divert it, I read a number of books in Cowper's Homer and smoked I know not how many cigars. 
</p><p>
I have had the agreeable society of Josiah Quinsy and Martin Lincoln to assist in consoling me a little of late. 
</p><p>
There is absolutely nothing to write, public or private, but such as the above. 
</p><p>
Adieu.
