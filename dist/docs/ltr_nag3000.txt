DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Inclosed you have a copy of the letter, in answer 
to mine to Congress, relative to cartridges. As soon 
as the cartridges come up, they shall be forwarded. 
Colonel Biddle has wrote to Amboy for ninety thousand that are at that post. 
</p><p>
We have collected all the wagons in our power, 
and sent over. Our people have had extreme hard 
duty ; the common guards, common fatigue, and the 
extraordinary guards and extraordinary fatigue, for 
the removal of the stores, and forwarding the provisions, have kept every man on duty. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a> requested a party of men to re-enforce them at Mount Washington. I sent between 
two and three hundred of Colonel Durkee's regiment. 
Please to inform me whether your Excellency approves thereof. 
</p><p>
We shall get a sufficient quantity of provisions 
over to-day for the garrison at Fort Washington. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague'>General Mifflin</a> thinks it not advisable to pull the 
barracks down yet. lie has hopes of our army returning to that ground for winter-quarters. I think 
this would be running too great a risk to leave them 
standing in expectation of such an event. There being  several strong fortifications in and about King's 
Bridge, if the enemy should throw in a thousand or 
fifteen hundred men,, they could cut off our communication effectually; and, as the state of the barracks 
is, they would find exceeding good cover for the 
men. But if we were to take the barracks down, if 
the boards were not removed, it would, in a great 
measure, deprive them of that advantage. However, 
I have not had it in my power to do either as yet. 
</p><p>
I have directed all the wagons that are on the 
other side to be employed in picking up the scattered boards about the encampments. I believe, from 
what I saw yesterday in riding over the grounds, 
they will amount to several thousands. As soon as 
we have got these together, I purpose to begin upon 
the barracks. In the mean time, I should be glad 
to know if your Excellency has any other orders to 
give respecting the business. 
</p><p>
I have directed the Commissary and Quartermaster-General of this department to lay in provisions and 
provender, upon the back road to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, for 
twenty thousand men for three months. The principal magazine will be at Aquackanock. I shall fortify 
it as soon as possible, and secure that post and the 
pass at the bridge, which is now repaired and fit for 
an army to pass over, with the baggage and artillery. 
I rejoice to hear of the defeat of that vile traitor, 
Major Rogers, and his party of Tories, though I am 
exceeding sorry to hear it cost us so brave an officer 
as Major Greene. I am, with great respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient servant, 
</p><p>
