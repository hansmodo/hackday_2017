DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
We have just received the welcome news of your 
having, with so much address and success, dislodged 
the Ministerial troops, and taken possession of the 
town of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. I congratulate you most heartily 
upon this glorious and important event; an event 
which will render <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>General Washington's</a> name immortal in the annals of America, endear his memory to 
the latest posterity, and entitle him to those thanks, which Heaven appointed as the reward of public virtue. 
</p><p>
It is the common opinion here, that we shall have 
a visit from General Howe in some of the Middle or 
Southern Colonies ; but it does not seem well found 
ed. I am very unable to judge of military affairs ; 
but it appears to me that if General Howe acts the 
part of a wise man, and an experienced officer, 
he will not venture a sickly, worn-out, disgusted, 
and disgraced army, in a country where he must 
meet immediate opposition, and where any misfortune 
might produce a mutiny or general desertion. I think it much more probable that he will retire to 
Halifax, give his troops a little time, by ease and refreshment, to recover their spirits, and be in readiness, as soon as the season permits, to relieve Quebec; keeping some ships of war cruising off <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> 
harbour, to protect and direct the transports which 
may arrive. <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, or any of the Northern 
United Provinces, are too near <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a> ; for, if he 
could not maintain the advantageous and strongly-fortified post of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, what reasonable hope has he 
of gaining and maintaining a new one in the face 
of a superior army ? 
</p><p>
You will perhaps smile at these speculative and 
idle suggestions upon a subject which will probably 
be reduced to a certainty, one way or another, long 
before this reaches your hands ; but, when I am conversing with you, the many agreeable hours we have 
spent together recur upon my mind. I fancy my 
self under your hospitable roof at <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, 
and lay aside reserve. May God grant us a return 
of those halcyon days, when every man may sit 
down at his ease, under the shade of his own- vine 
and his own fig-tree, and enjoy the sweets of domes 
tic life ! Or, if this is too much, may he be pleased 
to inspire us with spirit and resolution to bear our 
present and future sufferings becoming men deter 
mined to transmit to our posterity, unimpaired, the 
blessings we have received from our ancestors. 
</p><p>
Colonel Caswell's victory in North Carolina, and 
the military spirit which it has raised, will be an 
obstacle to any attempts in that quarter. Maryland 
and Virginia are at present rather unprepared, but 
their strength is daily increasing. The late levies 
here have been made with surprising rapidity, and 
the seven new regiments are already in a manner 
complete, except as to arms, in which they are very 
deficient; but arms are coming in, in small quantities, from different parts of the country, and a very 
considerable manufactory is established at Fredericksburg. Large ventures have been lately made for 
military stores ; for which purpose we are now loading  a ship for Europe, with tobacco, at <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a>. 
Her cargo is all on float, and I hope to have her 
under sailing in a few days. Notwithstanding the 
natural plenty of provisions in this Colony, I am 
very apprehensive of a great scarcity of beef and 
pork among our troops this summer, occasioned by 
the people's not expecting a market until the slaughter season was past. I find it extremely difficult to 
lay in a stock for about three hundred men, in the 
marine department of this river. 
</p><p>
Ill health, and a certain listlessness inseparable 
from it, have prevented my writing to you so often 
as I would otherwise have done but I trust to your 
friendship to excuse it. The same cause disabled me 
from attending the Committee of Safety this winter,, 
and induced me to entreat the Convention to leave 
me out of it. I continue to correspond constantly 
with that Board, and I hope am no less usefully employed, thinking it, in such times as these are, every 
man's duty to contribute his mite to the public service. 
</p><p>
I have, in conjunction with Mr. Dalton, the charge 
of providing and equipping armed vessels for the 
protection of this river. The thing is new to me, 
but I must endeavour to improve by experience. I 
am much obliged to the Board for joining Mr. Dal 
ton with me. lie is a steady, diligent man, and 
without such assistance I could not have undertaken 
it. We are building two row-galleys, which are inconsiderable forwardness ; and have purchased three sloops for cruisers. Two of them, being only from 
forty to fifty tons burden, are to mount eight carriage-guns each, three and four-pounders ; they are not yet fitted up. and we are exceedingly puzzled to get cannon for them. 
</p><p>
The other, the American Congress, is a fine stout 
vessel, of about one hundred and ten tons burden, 
and has such an easy draft of water as will enable 
her to run into most of the creeks, or small harbours, if she meets with a vessel of superior force. 
She mounts fourteen carriage-guns, six and four-pounders, though we have thoughts of mounting two 
nine-pounders upon her main beam, if we find her 
able, as we think she is, to bear them. Her guns 
are mounted, and to be tried to-morrow. We have 
twenty barrels of powder, and about a ton of shot 
ready ; more is making ; swivels we have not yet 
been able to procure, but she may make a tolerable 
shift without, until they can be furnished. We have 
got some small arms, and are taking every method 
to increase them, and hope to be fully supplied in 
about a week more. Her company of marines is 
raised, and have been for some time exercised to the 
use of the great guns. Her complement of marines 
and seamen is to be ninety-six men. We are exerting  ourselves to the utmost, and hope to have her 
on her station in less than a fortnight, and that the 
other vessels will quickly follow her, and be able to 
protect the inhabitants of this river from the piratical attempts of all the enemy's cutters, tenders, and small craft. 
</p><p>
Immediately upon receipt of your former letters, I applied to some of the Maryland Committees, as well 
as those on this side ; in consequence of which, the several most convenient places on this river were 
sounded, and thoroughly examined ; but effectual batteries were found, in our present circumstances, impracticable. Mr. Lund <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> tells me he sent 
you the draughts and soundings taken upon this occasion. A regiment, commanded by Colonel Mercer, of Frcdericksburg, is stationed on this part of the 
river, and I hope we shall be tolerably safe, unless a push is made here with a large body of men. I 
think we have some reason to hope the Ministry will bungle away another summer, relying partly upon force, and partly upon fraud and negotiation. 
</p><p>
The family here join with me in presenting their best compliments to yourself and lady, as well as to Mr. Custis and his. If, in any of your affairs here, I 
can render you any acceptable service, I beg you will use that freedom with which I wish you to command, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
