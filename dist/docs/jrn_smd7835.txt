I heard such a good joke last night! If I had be 
longed to the female declaiming club, I fear me I 
would have resigned instantly through mere terror. 
(Thank Heaven, I don t!) These officers say the 
women talk too much, which is undeniable. They 
then said, they meant to get up a sewing society, and 
place in it every woman who makes herself conspicuous by her loud talking about them. Fancy 
what a refinement of torture! But only a few would 
suffer; the majority would be only too happy to enjoy the usual privilege of sewing societies, slander, 
abuse, and insinuations. How some would revel in 
it. The mere threat makes me quake! If I could so 
far forget my dignity, and my father's name, as to 
court the notice of gentlemen by contemptible insult, etc., and if I should be ordered to take my seat 
at the sewing society ! ! ! I would never hold my 
head up again! Member of a select sewing circle! 
Fancy me! (I know "there is never any gossip in 
our society, though the one over the way gets up 
dreadful reports"; I have heard all that, but would 
rather try neither.) Oh, how I would beg and plead ! 
Fifty years at Fort Jackson, good, kind General Butler, rather than half an hour in your sewing 
society ! Gentle, humane ruler, spare me and I split 
my throat in shouting "Yankee Doodle" and "Hurrah for  <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a>!" Any, every thing, so I am not disgraced! Deliver me from your sewing society, and I'll say and do what you please!

Butler told some of these gentlemen that he had a detective watching almost every house in town, and 
he knew everything. True or not, it looks suspicious. We are certainly watched. Every evening two 
men may be seen in the shadow on the other side of 
the street, standing there until ever so late, some 
times until after we have gone to bed. It may be 
that, far from home, they are attracted by the bright 
light and singing, and watch us for their amusement. 
A few nights ago, so many officers passed and repassed while we were singing on the balcony, that I 
felt as though our habit of long standing had suddenly become improper. Saturday night, having 
secured a paper, we were all crowding around, Lilly 
and I reading every now and then a piece of news 
from opposite ends of the paper, Charlie, walking on 
the balcony, found five officers leaning over the fence 
watching us as we stood under the light, through 
the open window. Hope they won't elect me to the 
sewing society !
