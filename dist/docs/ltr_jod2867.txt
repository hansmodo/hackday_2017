I CANNOT omit the opportunity of writing you a line 
by this post This letter, will, I suppose, find you, in 
some degree or other, under the influence of the 
small pox. I The air is of very great importance. I 
don t know your physician, but I hope he wotf t deprive you of air, more than is necessary.

We had yesterday an express from General Lee in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, South Carolina, with an account of a 
brilliant little action between the armament under 
Clinton and Cornwallis, and a battery on Sullivan's 
Island, which terminated very fortunately for America. I will endeavour to enclose with this, a printed 
account of it It has given us good spirits here, and 
will have a happy effect upon our armies at New 
York and Ticonderoga. Surely our northern soldiers 
will not suffer themselves to be outdone by their brethren so nearly under the sun. I don l yet hear of any 
Massachusetts men at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. Our people must 
not flinch, at this critical moment, when their country 
is in more danger than it ever will be again, perhaps. 
What will they say, if the Howes should prevail 
against our forces, at so important a post as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, for want of a few thousand men from the Massachusetts ? I will likewise send you by this post, 
Lord Howe's letter and proclamation, which has let the cat out of the bag. These tricks deceive no longer. 
Gentlemen here, who either were or pretended to be deceived heretoforeVriow see or pretend to see through 
such artifices. I apprehend hi? Lordship is afraid of being attacked upon Staten Island, and is throwing out 
his barrels to amuse Leviathan, until his reinforcements shall arrive,
