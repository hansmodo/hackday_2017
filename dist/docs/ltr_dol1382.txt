Before this reaches you, my beloved sister, Lucy will be married to Judge Todd, 
of Kentucky. You are, I know, prepared for it, and reconciled to her choice of a 
man of the most estimable character. Their home is now to be in Lexington, 
very near our old friend, General Taylor, but as a Supreme Judge he is obliged to 
come here for two months every winter, and binds himself to bring her to her 
friends when she pleases to come. You may imagine my grief is not slight at the 
parting, and Lucy too is in deep distress. 
. . . All are busy electioneering yet.

The Federalists affronted to a man. Not one of the two houses of Congress 
will enter Madison's door since the communications of Henry except Livingston, 
who considers himself attached by his appointment.

General Dearborn has had a fall, which, though not serious, confines him to the house. . . .

The Vice-President lies dangerously ill, and electioneering for his office goes on beyond description the world seems to be 
running mad, what with one thing or another. The Federalists, as I told you, were 
all affronted with Madison, refused to dine with him, or even come to the house. 
But they have changed. Last night and the night before, our rooms were crowded 
with Republicans, and such a rallying of our party has alarmed them into a return. 
They came in a large body last night also, and are continuing calling ; even D. B. W. 
(who is a fine fellow) came last night. The old and the young turned out together. The war business goes on slowly, 
but I fear it will be sure. Where are your husband's vessels? and why does he not 
get them in ? Congress will be here until May, and perhaps longer.
