Dear J.P:  I too was very glad to hear from you and will write if you want me to.<p>
At present I'm managing a shop and am here by myself while the older woman is recovering from a serious operation.  Had been  working here for serveral months when she became ill just before Christmas.  Hope to see her back in about another month if everything goes well.<p>
It's rather hard to find anything to say as it has been so long since I last saw you and I wrote just about all the news in my last letter.<p>
So far I haven't gotten into any defense work as I've been working quite long hours part of the time and you can never count on the evenings you will or won't work.<p>
Anyway, I guess if I can calm down some women who are rather hysterical by fixing them up a bit why it's worth something. I'm not saying it is -- I don't know.<p>
I was very glad to hear you had rejoined the service I really respect anyone that is in the service especially the more I see of some people around here.  I'm not saying this just to be patriotic either for I really feel that way. You'd really laugh if you could have heard some of the arguments I've gotten into along this line. Ofcourse I always shoot off my face and say what I really think -- Dot always said everytime I opened my mouth I put my foot into it!<p>
The Navy is taking over Moffett Field again and heve really started to come in now.<p>
I'm writing this at work you can see how hard I'm working! There really isn't anything for me to do as this place has proter service.  --- A dame just came in to make an appointment for the moring. She's too tight to keep her hair dyed but she still wants the appearance -- if you know what I mean.  She's one customer I will gladly give back to Marie.<p>
I wish we had some of your sunshine - it's been raining for ages now.<p>
'Tis enough of this.  Sorry my letter is so poor but there isn't very much to say. I'm so glad to hear you are alright and really enjoyed your letter a lot.<p>
Take care of yourself and write when you have time.<p>
Sincerely yours, Ruth Anne
