DEAR FATHER:
</p><p>
Hearing from home frequently as I do through persons coming from there
and through occasional letters, I scarcely ever think of writing.
Hereafter, however, I will try to write oftener or have Jesse write.
The children might all write to you for that matter. We hear
occasionally from Fred. directly and very often through the papers. He
has enjoyed his European trip very much and I think will be much
improved by it. Nellie writes very often; she is a very much better
writer than either of the boys. Her composition is easy and fluent, and
she writes very correctly. She seems to have made a very good
impression where she has been.--Buck sails for Europe on the 6th of
July. He will travel but little however. He expects to study his third
year Harvard course in some quiet German village, and return in June
next in time for his examinations. In this way he expects to graduate
at the same time he would if he did not go abroad. The object is to
acquire a speaking knowledge of both the German and French languages,
in both of which he is now quite a good scholar.
</p><p>
I received a letter from Mary a short time since. She said that she
would leave for home about the first of June. You may expect her home
by the twentieth no doubt.
</p><p>
Julia and Jesse are well and send much love to you and Mother.
</p><p>
Sincerely yours,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.
