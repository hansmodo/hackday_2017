Sir, 
</p><p>
In the moment I was writing to your Excellency I received a confirmation of the result of the engagement on the 12th of April, which, by all the 
reports from the Cape, Port au Prince, and all the intelligence from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and Jamaica, seems very bad for us.
</p><p>
I was proposing to join that, as there was not as yet 
any plan for the campaign decided at our Court, and 
as I waited, with the greatest impatience, for the arrival of the Duke of Lauzun, I thought that it was 
suitable to march the corps towards <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, that, 
jointly with your army, we might hinder the enemy 
from sending any forces to the aid of Jamaica. These 
bad news quite overthrow that military speculation, 
so that I see no more reason for that march of the French corps to join you, unless there be political 
ones, which I must submit to your reflection and to your order. 
</p><p>
The Captain of a flag, arrived yesterday from New 
York, assures that he had sailed with thirty-six transports, escorted by three ships of war, going to <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. They are empty, and it is believed they are going to evacuate those places. If that 
be the case, all their forces being assembled there, 
there is nothing more for us to do. If the army 
moves that way, we must assure a protection to 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, where will stay our navy 
and heavy artillery, by a body of militia which Virginia must furnish, to which I would add five [regiments of] French troops; and, considering the resolution of the British Parliament not to carry on an 
offensive war on the Continent, I cannot see any good 
proceeding from the march of the French troops on 
New York. On the contrary, I think it might engage Carleton to send a detachment and make some 
undertaking against our ships, when the army would 
be at a great distance, as he might undertake against 
the French without deviating from the resolution not 
to carry on any longer an ofiensive war on the Continent, to endeavour to reduce America by force. 
Such, Sir, are my observations. I communicate them 
to the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague'>Chevalier De La Luzerne</a>, and submit them to 
the reflections and orders of your Excellency. I am, 
with respect and personal attachment. Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
