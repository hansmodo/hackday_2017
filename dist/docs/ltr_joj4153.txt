Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The letters which you were so obliging as to write to me 
from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> have been received, and disposed of in 
the manner you requested. 
</p><p>
The information communicated in those letters has given 
me much concern. The expediency of the president's 
declaration, that he would not send another minister to 
France, until he should receive assurances, &c, was not, 
in my judgment, unquestionable. There are political considerations against it, and there are others in its favour. 
Such a declaration, however, was made, and the propriety 
of it seems to have been acquiesced in. 
</p><p>
It is to be wished that Mr. Murray had been more reserved in his conversations with the French secretary, on 
the subject of our national differences. These matters 
were foreign to his department, and I presume they were not within his instructions. Those conversations have 
facilitated overtures, which are calculated, and I believe 
designed, to perplex and divide our councils, and to mislead 
public opinion. 
</p><p>
The manner in which Mr. Murray transmitted these 
overtures to the president, is such a deviation from the official 
and customary course, as (unless adopted for extraordinary 
and substantial reasons) is certainly exceptionable. Nor 
does any reason occur to me, why the president thought it 
proper to omit communicating the overtures to the secretary of state. Such is my confidence in the patriotism of 
the president, and also of the secretary, that every indication of want of confidence between them appears to me 
singular, and to be regretted. 
</p><p>
Whether these overtures (considered in connexion with 
the before-mentioned declaration of the president, and other 
existing circumstances) should have been accepted, or encouraged, or rejected, or neglected, a iv questions not free 
from doubts. I am inclined to think that immediate attention 
to them was neither necessary nor advisable, and that they 
had not as yet acquired such a degree of maturity, as to call 
for any formal, national act. But viewing this subject in all 
its various relations, I suspect it is one of those on which 
statesmen might naturally be led to opposite opinions, by 
the difficulty of estimating the precise weight and balance 
of the many and diverse considerations comprehended 
in it. 
</p><p>
Much might be said, but not to much purpose ; for whatever remarks maybe applicable to the origin, progress, and 
present state of this perplexing affair, it is as it is. Nothing 
thorefore remains, but to make the best of the situation into 
which we are carried, and to avail ourselves of all the 
advantages to be derived from the united talents and efforts 
of the best friends to our country and government. The 
apprehensions entertained from the projected negotiation 
may not be extensively realized, and events may yet arise 
to press the Directory into proper measures relative to this 
countryâ€” measures not to be expected from their sincerity, 
or sense of decorum or justice. 
</p><p>
I am for aiding and adhering to the president, and for 
promoting the best understanding between him and the 
heads of the departments. Notwithstanding what has happened, I hope his real friends will not keep at a distance 
from him, nor withhold from him that information, which 
none but his friends will give him. Union, sedate firmness, 
and vigorous preparations for war, generally afford the best 
means of counteracting the tendencies of insidious professions, and of too great public confidence in them. 
With great esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
