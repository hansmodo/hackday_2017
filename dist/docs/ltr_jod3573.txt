MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
OUR anti-federal scribblers are so fond of rotations 
that they seem disposed to remove their abuse from 
me to the President. Bache's paper, which is 
nearly as bad as Freneau's, begins to join in concert with it to maul the President for his drawing 
rooms, levees, declining to accept of invitations to 
dinners and tea parties, his birth day odes, visits, 
compliments, &c. I may be expected to be an advocate for a rotation of objects of abuse and for equality 
in this particular. I have held the office of Libellee General long enough. The burden of it ought to be 
participated and equalized according to modern re 
publican principles. 
</p><p>
The news from France, so glorious for the French 
army, is celebrated in loud peals of festivity, and 
elevates the spirits of the enemies of government 
among us more than it ought, for it will not answer 
their ends. We shall now see the form of the 
French republic. Their conventions will have many 
trials to make before they will come at any thing permanent. The calamities of France are not over. 
I shall claim the merit of some little accuracy of 
foresight when I see <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague met friend'>General Lincoln</a>, who, you re 
member, was inclined to think the Duke of Bruns 
wick's march to Paris certain, while I Was apprehensive that the numerous fortified towns in his way 
would waste his army and consume the campaign. 
</p><p>
We shall soon see the operation in France of elections to first magistracies. My attention is fixed to 
this object. I have no doubt of its effects ; but it is 
a curious question how long they can last. We have 
lately seen how they have succeeded in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
and what effect that election has had upon the votes 
for President. Cabal, intrigue, manoeuvre, as bad as 
any species of corruption, we have already seen in 
our elections, and when and where will they stop ? 
Tenderly, 
</p><p>
