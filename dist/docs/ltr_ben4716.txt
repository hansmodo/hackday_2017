DEAR SIR 
</p><p>
After the Society was gone, my Lord Moreton said (when 
I offered him the Paper) that it ought to have been deliver'd 
before and read to the Society: he however desir'd me to 
produce it to the Council. There the Reading of it was 
oppos'd, as not being referred to them by the Society. But 
this was at last got over, by Dr. Moreton's proposing that the giving a Medal to Dr. Priestley should be taken into Consideration, and that in order to judge the better of the Propriety of that Proposal, the Paper should be read. It was 
accordingly read. I was then desired as the best Judge present to give my Opinion of the Merit of the Experiments as to 
the Medal ; Which I did in plain Terms, declaring it as my 
judgment that the great Pains and Expence the Doctor had 
been at in making them and the Importance of the Experiments themselves, well deserved that Encouragement from the 
Society ; and that it was a Mark of Distinction justly due to 
so much philosophical Industry and Sagacity. 
</p><p>
One that sat near me, told me he was surpriz'd at the Ace' 
I had given, as he had been assured the Medal was intended 
to be bestow'd on the Doctor only for writing a History which 
was thought wrong, but it now appeared he had made many 
valuable new Experiments, etc. Then a Question arose, how 
far it was proper to give a Medal for Experiments that had 
not been sent to the Society, till they were published; and 
this occasioned a search for Sir Godfrey Copley's Will, which 
could not be found ; but an Agreement was found, recorded 
between the Society and his Executors, that the 5 should 
be given for the best Experiment within the Year, proposed 
and directed to be made by the Society; and made in their 
Presence. This not having been the Practice of late Years, 
it began to be whisper'd that most of the Medals had been 
irregularly given. A subsequent Resolution was, however, 
found to print the Clause of Sir Godfrey Copley's Will in 
every Number of the Transactions, for the Encouragement of 
Foreigners, to endeavour obtaining the Reward, as there was 
reason to fear a Failure of Experiments upon the former Plan. 
</p><p>
By this Time it grew late, and it was concluded that the 
Books should be searched, to find all the Steps that had been 
taken in disposing of this Prize, whether in Money or in 
Medals, from the first instance in <a href='/results.php?year=1717'>1717</a> to the last; with the 
Reasons and Grounds on which the Council had proceeded, 
and that a Copy of that Part of Sir Godfrey's Will should be 
obtained from the Commons ; when at the next Council, the 
Matter might be reconsidered, and the Medal then given to 
Dr. Priestley, if the Council thought fit, and it should be 
found not contrary to the Will so to do. Thus the Business 
ended for that time; and how it will conclude at last seems 
an Uncertainty, for I think some Persons are busy in an 
Opposition to the Measure. But I hope it will end in favour 
of Merit, in which case I think our Friend cannot miss it.

Your most obed' Servant
