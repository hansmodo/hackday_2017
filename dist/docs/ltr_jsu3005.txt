MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
It is with the greatest pain I inform you, that, 
after our retreat from Canada to this place, of which 
I have given your Excellency an account through 
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, and after I had determined to 
make a stand here till I received your Excellency's 
order, I find myself under an absolute necessity of 
quitting this Island for a place more healthy- other 
wise the army will never be able to return, as one 
fortnight longer in this place will not leave us well 
men enough to carry off the sick, exclusive of the 
public stores, which I have preserved thus far. The 
raging of the smallpox deprives us of whole regiments in the course of a few days, by their being 
taken down with that cruel disorder. But this is not 
all. The camp disorder rages to such a degree that, 
of the regiments remaining, from twenty to sixty in 
each are taken down in a day, and we have nothing to give them, but salt pork., flour, and the poisonous waters of this Lake. I have, therefore, determined, 
with the unanimous voice of the officers, to remove to Isle-la-Motte, a place much more healthy than this, where I have some hope we shall preserve the 
health of the few men we have, till some order is taken respecting our future movements. 
</p><p>
I think it would be by far the best to remove to 
Crown Point, fortify that, build row-galleys to command the Lake, and by scouting parties to defend 
our frontiers, as the savages have already begun upon 
us. They have made two attacks upon our men, 
killed and taken near twenty, among whom are some 
officers. These officers went on shore unarmed, when 
I was gone to reconnoitre Point-au-Fer. The other 
party went on shore at river Lecot to buy milk. 
They were in boats loaded with flour, which they 
brought off, but had some men killed. The whole of 
our loss, in killed and taken, amounts to about twenty. This happened in both cases for want of that 
care which should ever be taken in an enemy's country. I hope it will be a warning to our people in future. 
</p><p>
I hear, from all quarters, that the enemy arc very 
numerous in Canada. Their shipping is also numerous, and it cannot be doubted that all the Canadians 
and all the Indians in this quarter will be compelled 
to bear arms against us. This I know they would 
gladly have avoided ; but, finding that we are not 
able to afford them that protection we promised, they 
are obliged to make their peace, in the best manner 
they can. I think it is now past a doubt, that the 
neglect and inattention to this department has not 
only lost us Canada, but involved us in a war with 
all the blacks and whites in this quarter; and to check their progress I know of no better method 
than to secure the important posts of <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> 
and Crown Point, and, by building a number of 
armed vessels, command the Lakes ; otherwise the 
forces now in Canada will be brought down upon us 
as quick as possible, having nothing now to oppose 
them in that Colony. 
</p><p>
They have a number of bateaux framed, which 
they brought from Three Rivers. They will doubt 
less construct some armed vessels, and then endeavour 
to penetrate the country toward <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. This, I 
am persuaded, they will attempt, but am sure they 
can never effect, unless we neglect to secure the important posts now in our power. I have written to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, and wait with impatience for his answer, as I know that no time ought to be lost in 
fortifying this place or Crown Point. If I attempt 
to fortify here, and afterwards am ordered to leave 
it, I shall strengthen the enemy, by preparing a 
work for them, which I would not willingly do. If 
I am to tarry and fortify here, I should be glad to 
know it as soon as possible, that I may put the order in execution ; but I must say that, unless our 
men grow much more healthy, our army here will be 
no kind of check upon the enemy after remaining in 
this low marsh for a few weeks longer. 
</p><p>
I inclose your Excellency a general return, drawn 
from the returns made the day before yesterday; 
since which I suppose a quarter part have been taken 
down with the camp disorder. This, however incredible it may seem, is a real fact. For instance, Colonel Wayne has sixty, out of one hundred and thirty-eight, taken down since. Colonel Dehaas and all 
his field-officers, with a number of his men, are since 
taken clown. This seems to run through the whole, no corps being exempt from it. I am shocked to re late, but much more to see, this dreadful havoc among the troops. 
</p><p>
I inclose your Excellency a return of the ordnance 
and stores at St. John's on the 12th instant. The 
whole could not, in our confused state, be procured. 
As to the provisions, some are on board the armed 
vessels, some at this place, and some at Isle-la-Motte, 
which were never brought further down. I can make 
no accurate return at present. I will have one made 
as soon as possible and forward it, and send regular 
returns in future. I do not despair of getting this 
army yet into some kind of order and regulation ; but 
T must confess that it is a work of time and trouble, as order and regularity seem to have been 
strangers in this northern army. 
</p><p>
I received your Excellency's favor of the 13th instant. I am extremely sorry it was not in my power 
to fulfil your Excellency's wishes, by leading on our 
troops to victory. The reasons for my not being able 
have doubtless long since reached you in my letters 
giving an account of the strength of the enemy, the 
weakness of our army, and the unhappy defeat of 
General Thompson at Three Rivers, as also the result of our Council of War in Canada, I think we 
shall secure all the public stores and baggage of the 
army, and secure our retreat, with very little loss. 
Whether we shall have W 7 ell men enough to carry 
them on, I much doubt, if we don t remove quickly, 
unless Heaven is pleased to restore health to this 
wretched army, now, perhaps, the most pitiful one 
that ever was formed. 
</p><p>
There is no return of Colonel Patterson's regiment, 
as he has but five men here fit for duty, whom I 
this day ordered to Crown Point to join the rest of the regiment, who are all sick there. You may as 
sure yourself, my dear General, that nothing shall be 
wanting, on my part, to restore order among the 
troops here and to recover their health, as also to 
throw every stumblingblock in the way of the enemy, that lies in the power of your Excellency's 
Most affectionate, humble servant, 
</p><p>
