My dear General, 
</p><p>
My letter of the 23d to your Excellency will, I 
hope, be safely transmitted, as the bearer of it. Major McLane, assured me that in case he was obliged to 
lose the despatch-boat, he could find means to get 
ashore and forward the despatches by land.'" In that 
letter, I gave to your Excellency an account of what 
had passed since I left <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a>, and communicated the intelligence of a British fleet having anchored in 
Lynn Haven Bay. This account, however, you will 
have sooner received from the Governor of Virginia, 
than you might possibly from me. My position with 
the troops near <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> being intended to reconnoitre the works, and get, on board of ships in Hampton Road, intelligence from the Capes was more speedily forwarded through <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, than it might 
have been in going around to Suffolk. 
</p><p>
;My surprise at not hearing of the French fleet was, 
I confess, very great, nor could I reconcile my mind 
to this uncertainty. But intelligence, received yesterday, has put it out of doubt, that they have done 
their best endeavours towards the cooperation ; and my 
accounts being gathered from many quarters, and 
some men who were at the first engagement, your 
Excellency may depend upon their veracity. 
</p><p>
On the 16th instant, both fleets fell in near the 
Capes with each other. They both consisted of eight 
ships of the line, fifties included, with the difference 
of twenty guns in favor of the enemy. Each ship of 
the line, and each frigate, singly engaged a partner, 
and the action lasted during three glasses. The enemy had two seventy-fours, much worsted ; one of them 
had sixty-five men killed. The London suffered in 
her rigging, and the British fleet sheered off for the 
Chesapeake, while the French stood in a line formed 
in good order. The enemy have sent their wounded 
up to <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, taken all the sailors and marines 
at that place, and refitted their damaged ships. They 
were also reenforced from <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> by the Charon, 
a forty-four, that can be made a fifty, and two large 
frigates. But it appears that our allies are determined to carry the point, and that the addition to the 
British force has not prevented them from appearing 
near the Capes. Last morning the whole British 
fleet, with the reenforcement, went to sea, and about 
eleven o'clock we heard a furious cannonade, which 
lasted more than three hours. 
</p><p>
The action must have been bloody and obstinate. 
Upon its event depends the fate of our expedition. 
I wish it had been in my power not to make your 
Excellency a partaker of our anxiety, until I might 
have known on what side victory has been. But the 
fresh winds that blew last night make it impossible 
to have any account this morning. I shall, therefore, 
send off the present intelligence, which has come last 
night to hand; and, as expresses with proper officers 
are stationed at Hampton, I shall speedily forward 
every account that appears to be certain and interesting. 
</p><p>
I have directed that Arnold be circumscribed within 
his works on both sides of the Dismal Swamp. 
The water is still open to him, but every armed vessel in the river is getting ready to do what little 
service can be expected from them. The detachment 
at <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a> is also ordered to be in the most perfect readiness. With the highest respect, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.,
