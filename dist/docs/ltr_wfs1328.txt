<p></p>
I have received your letter of the 21st instant, 
accompanied by certain proceedings of the General 
Peace Convention. 
<p></p>
My participation in war, as well as endeavors on 
several occasions to preserve peace, without sacrificing 
the honor and the interests of my country, are matters 
of public history. These antecedents, together with 
my sentiments on the abstract question of peace and 
war, inserted a year ago in a Peace Album, and since 
published, I learn, in several journals, might be offered 
as a sufficient reply to your communication. 
<p></p>
I have always maintained the moral right to wage 
a just and necessary war, and, consequently, the wisdom and humanity, as applicable to the United States, 
in the present state of the world, of defensive preparations. If the principal nations of the earth liable to 
come in conflict with us in our natural growth and 
just pursuits, can be induced to disarm, I should be 
happy to see the United States follow the example. 
But without a general agreement to that effect, and a 
strong probability that it would be carried out in good 
faith by others, I am wholly opposed to giving up 
home preparation, and the natural and Christian right 
of self-defence. 
<p></p>
The published sentiments alluded to may not have 
fallen under your observation. I enclose a copy. 
I remain respectfully, 
<p></p>
Your most obedient servant, 
<p></p>
