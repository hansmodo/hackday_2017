</p><p>
SIR: 
</p><p>
I now resume the subject of the intention that the Ministry perhaps entertained of considering me as a Minister to 
this court. And several circumstances that occurred both 
before and after the levee convinced me that such an intention still existed. The next day a paragraph appeared 
in one of the ministerial papers, stating that Mr. Adams, the 
new envoy from the United States of America, had delivered 
his credentials, etc. 
</p><p>
I had reason to expect that a similar paragraph would 
appear in the next Gazette, and though I could not be responsible for their acts or pretensions, I did not mean they 
should ever have a pretence to make a point of the thing on 
the ground of a misapprehension. I went therefore to Mr. 
Hammond, and clearly stated to him, that I am not to be 
considered as a Minister of the United States to this court, 
observing that from the first moment of my arrival to the 
present I had expressed myself in the most explicit manner 
on this point, both to Lord Grenville and to himself. The 
paragraph has, of course, not yet appeared in the Gazette. 
It had, however, already been sent for insertion, stating 
that I had delivered credentials as Minister Resident of 
the United States. Mr. Hammond, on my conversing with 
him, endeavored to frame the paragraph in a different manner so as to meet my ideas ; but I did not think proper to 
take on me any responsibility whatever by approbation of 
a thing over which I have no control. I told him that I was 
answerable for my conduct as it concerns my own country; 
but could not be so for any insertion in the Gazettes made by 
authority of this government. 
</p><p>
In consequence of this discussion, Mr. Hammond found it 
necessary, or thought proper at length, to say that, "to be 
sure my credential letter was completely informal" To this 
I made no answer, but his idea of its informality I take to 
arise from their maxim that the King of Great Britain will 
not admit a foreigner in the character of a Minister to another 
government than his own. To the accuracy of this principle, 
I must confess, I see no reasonable objection, and on that 
account I had not on my arrival any idea of a formal audience. When it was intimated to me by Lord Grenville that 
this would be necessary in point of form, I acquiesced, be 
cause I conceived that on the article of forms here it was not 
my business to contend with them, and if they chose to over 
leap or evade the principle above mentioned, it was at their 
own peril, and not a concern of mine. The principle that if a Prince does admit a foreign Minister, it can only be in the 
character attributed to him in his credentials, was a full security to us, as I concluded, against any inference of sub 
stance that they might wish to draw from a mere ceremonial parade. 
</p><p>
It has, therefore, now become certain that, by their customary forms, my audience was not only unnecessary but in 
admissible. Mr. Hammond suggested to me that the objection had not been made because it had escaped their 
notice, and observed that in the multiplicity of their business it was impossible they should attend to everything. The 
observation may be true ; but can the oversight be credited after my notice given to Lord Grenville that I had no com 
mission to this court, and after the very explicit declaration contained in my letter to him, the copy of which is inclosed. 
</p><p>
It seems much more probable that it was an express design 
of Mr. Hammond himself by means of this audience to construe me into a Minister to this court. And this design appears to have been so important in his mind, that to effect 
its execution he did not hesitate to return me in Lord Gren-ville's name such an answer as that, the copy of which is in closed. 
</p><p>
Negotiation in the system of these people seems to consist only in the art of reducing to a dilemma. One instance 
has been given in a former letter. In the present case, I was placed, not unskilfully, in that of declining a customary form. I chose to deliver my letter, taking care to show them distinctly that I meant to keep the form separate 
from any false inference they might choose to draw from it. 
</p><p>
But although I have endeavored with all the caution of which I was capable to avoid a snare, if it was laid, I am not yet without concern lest some use may be designed to be 
made of my conduct, of which I am not aware. Time alone 
can discover what Mr. Hammond's motive could be for such a manoeuvre as this. That he had a motive, and a strong 
one, cannot well be doubted, for such a practice could not be recommended by the mere pleasure of employing it. 
</p><p>
After reflecting in the most serious manner upon it, I can only conjecture that the object is to procure a certain pre 
text upon a future occasion. I trust, however, that if it should be attempted to be raised, it will be found necessary 
to abandon it ; and, indeed, had not my opinion been such, I should have peremptorily refused to deliver my credential 
letter, even at the risk of what was brought so pointedly before me. Whether my conjecture be well founded or not, 
a short time will, I hope, ascertain, and the result will of course be made known to you. 
</p><p>
I have the honor &c.
