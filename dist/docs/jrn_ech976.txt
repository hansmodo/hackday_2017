Last evening a number of the second cabin passengers, myself included, took a sociable glass and then another, and the dose was repeated until we got on a "regular bust." Three poor fellows were entirely overcome and prostrated. The party kept up until long after the noon of night, but we all, with the exception of one, made our appearance at the breakfast table to stay our eager appetites. This has been my first frolic since leaving home and, as I can't say they are of much benefit, it will most probably be my last.

The day was ushered in with an accident to one of our Association, Mr. James Monroe, who was precipitated down the steps with the coffee pot full of coffee. The coffee was spilled and scalded his right arm and hand from the elbow down. Sweet-oil and turpentine were immediately applied and it is now doing quite well. A rumpus was raised at the breakfast table which came near resulting in a fight. One of the passengers seized the coffee pot out of another's hand in a very rude manner.

We crossed the Tropic of Cancer in damp and disagreeable weather, and are now in the Trade Winds. Our old ship rocked so we could not stand without holding fast to something, and interfered considerably with locomotion. The trunks in our cabin got rolling about and stirred up a great muss. A jar of pickles was broken. We made 163 miles in 24 hours. Many of the passengers were very seasick. We removed our trunks and washed our cabin, not before the sailors had refused the Captain's request to cleanse it, however, and we had no other remedy.

I saw two birds about the size and appearance of our whippoorwill, but I am unable to learn their name. Doyle is reported to have beat his wife. I have been
reading the "Life and Adventures of Henry Smith, the 'Razor Strop Man.'"

Last night the ocean presented a very singular and beautiful appearance, being covered with floating islands of a bright substance called Medusæ Pelucen, the reflection of which, as the vessel ploughed through it, made it light enough to read in the lower cabin. The substance is white and glutinous when taken out of the water and somewhat resembles a fine honeycomb, but at night, floating in the sea, it presents the appearance of the common glowworm. It is peculiar to this latitude, not being seen except in small quantities at other places. The heavens, overcast with dark, thick clouds, threatened rain, notwithstanding which but little rain fell. Contrary to my expectations, the weather still continues pleasant, and not as warm as when we left the States. We saw a large flock of sea birds in the distance.
