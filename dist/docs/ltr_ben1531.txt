My dear Child,
</p><p>
I wrote to you largely just before we left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=London" rel="city">London</a>; we have been out now almost 3 Weeks, having spent some time in Derbyshire among the Gentry there to whom we were recommended, as also at Manchester and this Place. We shall set out to day for Lancaster. The Journey agrees extremely well with me; and will probably be many ways of use to me. Billy presents his Duty, and Peter. I am not certain whether we shall continue our Route to Scotland or return thro’ Yorkshire and Lincolnshire to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=London" rel="city">London</a> but expect to meet Letters at Lancaster that will determine me. I long much to hear from you and shall endeavour to return early next Spring. My Duty to Mother, and Love to Sally and all Friends. I am, as ever, my dear Debby, Your affectionate Husband
