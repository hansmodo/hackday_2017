My dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
Your several letters of the 8th  i8 th 24th  & 25th  with extracts from 
various newspapers in relation to various matters, particularly in regard 
to subjects connected with the manner of conducting the war, was rec d a 
few days since, for which I sincerely thank you. As to the course which 
has been pursued toward me by the authorities at Washington, in which 
I am satisfied <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> took a conspicuous part notwithstanding his 
professions I shall say but little having expressed my views pretty freely 
to you in my last communication from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>. One of the expectations of those who perpetrated the outrage against me was, that I would 
at once leave the country, in disgust & return to the U. States which if I 
had done so, would have been freely used by them to my disadvantage, 
as far as they could have done so, but in this I shall disappoint them, as 
I have determined to remain & do my duty no matter under what cir 
cumstances until I am withdrawn, or entirely superseded by the orders 
of those who placed me in command here. At the same time I have 
addressed a communication to the adjt Gen of the army, to be submitted 
to the Secy of War, & by him to be laid before <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">the President</a> of the U. 
States, complaining in strong but respectful terms as to the manner I 
have been treated, pointing out the injurious effects which has resulted to 
the public service growing out of the same ; which communication may 
have the effect of an order from the War dep 1 for me to return at once 
to the Un. States, if nothing worse ; but I shall [not] flinch from 
any cours the Sec? may think proper toward me 
</p><p>
As I informed you I was about to do, I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> on the 31" 
ult & reached Saltillo on the second ins 1 where there had been owing to 
the capture of two detachments of mounted Volunteers belonging to the 
Kentucky & Arkansas Rgt s consisting of 2 Majr s 3 Capt s 2 or 3 Lt s & 
about 100 picked men & horses, of which I believe I informed you in my 
last letter, by the enemy, in addition to a report that they were advancing 
in great force to drive us from Saltillo, produced such a panic that I 
deemed it necessary at once to join this portion of the army, to restore 
confidence if possible, as well as to be present should the enemy attempt 
to carry his threats, or reported threats into execution. I found most of 
the troops in & near the City of Saltillo, which I considered a very injudicious position, & at once removed them about 2 miles in advance, on 
the San Luis road, where I have established a camp of between 4 & 5 
thousand men, as well as located myself, & where I shall fight the enemy 
should he be disposed to give me battle ; & alth nearly the whole of my 
command are volunteers, I have no doubt we will give a satisfactory 
acc of him, in such an event, as confidence seems to be not only re 
stored, but the greatest enthusiasm appears to pervade the whole of the 
forces, & all express themselves desirous to come in collision with the 
enemy. 
</p><p>
I have ordered to be thrown forward here, by the first of April, 50 
days rations forage transportation &c for 10,000 men when if peace is 
not brought about by that time & Gen S. does not filch from me too 
large a portion of the troops, which he will do as far as he has the means 
of transportation, whether they are necessary or otherwise to the success 
of his expedition, I will if not otherwise instructed from Washington, 
move against the enemy in some quarter or other ; particularly if a landing is effected & Vera Cruz taken, & a move made on the City of Mexico 
by our people 
</p><p>
By the last mail which reached here three days since, I rec d an 
answer from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a> to a communication I wrote him from Victoria, 
in which I did not disguise my feelings ; he is somewhat tart in his reply, 
& among other matters advises me to fall back to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> ; which I 
informed him I could not think of doing without peremptory orders to 
that effect from proper authority ; he & myself now understand each 
other perfectly, & there can for the future be none other than official 
intercourse between us. As regards the application for Johns app in 
the navy, I do not calculate on its being successful alth from their let 
ters to you, on that subject I am satisfied that Mr Cranston and Mr Hunt 
as well as some others will do all they can to promote it ; but unfortunately they are on the wrong side of politicks, & I am satisfied that 
nothing I could say or do in the matter would aid him, as you must be 
aware from Wells letter, that I aMrather in bad odor at the white 
House ; as I stated before, my only hope as regards this matter is from 
the high character of the Sec? of the navy, who knowing and appreciating 
my position, services &c as they should be, & understanding or knowing 
John s relationship to me, may disregard party considerations & give him 
the app t in question ; if he does not, he John must turn his attention to 
some other business ; at the same time you ought to be satisfied having 
done all in your power to accomplish his wishes. As Rob is with you 
I hope you will be able to keep him constantly employed at his book or 
pen ; it is very important to give him a taste for reading, the greatest 
difficulty will be I apprehend to procure such books as would be proper 
for him to read at his age ; history he might study to great advantage. 
As I understand his mother cannot manage him, it may be best for him 
to be with you, until you leave the country, when you can locate him at 
some literary institution with a prospect of his continuing at it

I got by last mail a letter from Betty dated at Point Coupee where 
she then was with Puss, the 13th  ult saying they were all well at Baton 
Rouge, where they would go in a day or two, that Dick whose health 
had improved, had just come up for them ; that she had been invited to 
go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> with Mr & Mrs Taylor, but had not made up her mind 
whether or not she would do so Congress or the lower House, & I make no doubt the Senate will 
concur has passed a bill to raise ten additional Regt s for the war, the 
whole to be disbanded at its close ; but I cannot see the propriety of the 
measure unless it be to frighten the enemy into making a peace, which I 
still entertain the hope will be the case or that the first steps will be taken 
to bring about the same with the certainty of its succeeding between this 
& the last of March, as they cannot fill the old corps or Regt s 
</p><p>
I presume there will be a great accession to the medical staff, some 
of whom as a matter of course as in the present case of those now in 
service, will do no duty, being appointed from political considerations. 
I observe your remarks in regard to McCormac ; he is among those 
who are to be exempt from field or unpleasant duty of any kind ; it is 
unquestionably much more pleasant to be stationed at the S c Charles with 
fuel & quarters, than to be in the field in flimsy tents in cold & frosty 
weather in a country where there is neither wood or any substitute for 
fuel without in some places going 20 miles in the mountains for it ; the 
wood the army used in Saltillo was brought 20 miles, & procured in the 
mountains. But matters & things must run their course, let them terminate as they may

I regret to hear of Lanyons illness which arrested him at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a> 
Kentucky, but truly hope he is so far recovered as to be now on his way 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">N. Orleans</a> if not already there ; & in sufficient health to continue on 
his route to Mexico ; <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="colleague">Gen Scott</a>s h d quarters being I presume his place 
of destination. He is however well stricken in years & feeble in health 
& constitution, & it would take but little to carry him off, in which case 
there is now no telling who would succeed him ; I fear as " evil men 
bear sway" it would not be Surg n Mower

I am truly sorry to hear Gen Jesup intends having the post office 
removed from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Point Isabel" rel="city">Point Isabel</a> to Brasos, where it has worked very well ; 
but I presume it will be done for his own convenience & accommodation 
& that of a few of his satalights. I have looked on the Gen as partially 
deranged ever since he wrote the Blair letter ; & I regretted when I 
heard he was coming South to meddle in army operations going on in 
Mexico under my direction, or that of any other person. I think you 
mentioned in one of your letters that he had informed you, that he had 
written me on some subject or other, if so the same has miscarried, as it 
has never reached me. There has been for the success of our arms, too 
many persons tinkering in my rear with the view of breaking me down, 
or to make a little capital for themself disregarding the interest of the 
country. I deeply regret to hear of the sufferings of your good mother 
& was satisfied at her advanced age, that as soon as she fully understood 
her bereavement there was no hope of comforting her, & would, do all 
her devoted family could to prevent it, soon would carry her to an other 
& to her, no doubt a better world ; which those she leaves behind should 
bear up against with as much resignation as they can summon to their 
aid, & bear in mind that we should never give up the living for the 
dead ; & that it is a debt we must all pay sooner or later

Finlay after inspecting the Texas Volunteers has permission to leave 
the country on acct of bad health ; I think it would have been better had 
he remained a short time as he will fall under the ban of the powers that 
be at Washington. I am truly sorry to find you write so despondingly ; 
whenever your affairs make it necessary for you to atten to them per 
sonally, I will give you a leave of absence for that object, if left in 
com d But I wish you to put it off as long or as late in the spring as 
possible. If Craig does not return you will be the sen r medical officer 
in the country, & if so & you wish it I will order you to join me as 
medical director. But in this consult your own wishes & convenience. 
I am pained to hear of Dr Russells situation & think he had better at 
once leave the country on surgeons certificate which I will approve 
My regards to him & love to Bob.
