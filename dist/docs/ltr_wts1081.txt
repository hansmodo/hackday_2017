Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
I suppose that by this time you have become quite an 
expert engineer, much better acquainted with " Jacob 
staffs," chains, compasses, etc., than you used to be 
with Euclid and Virgil; and I hope to hear from you 
soon that you have become highly pleased with your 
occupation. 
</p><p>
I presume that you will not be able to work all winter, 
on account of the cold, and during this time no doubt 
you will go home ; and if you are detained there by the 
weather, which will probably be the case, I would advise 
you to continue your study of the mathematics or whatever else may be connected with your business. You 
must write to me soon, and tell me all about your campaign or trip, and what particular office you nil in the 
company, etc., etc. Excuse the shortness of this. 
Your affectionate brother, 
</p><p>
