</p><p>
Dear Fellow:--Out of doors the rain is pouring down in torrents and the storm is howling desperately. In the Record office, around a warm stove, comfortably sit the members of the office. I have just aided in masticating one of those old-fashioned dinners we have on Sunday at the editor's and did justice to a piece of roast chicken. But I do not wish to tantalize you.
</p><p>
If your vessel has had good luck she must have rounded Cape Horn, and you have become acquainted with all the dangers of this terrible passage. I would give something handsome to know whether the California fever has subsided any with you! When you arrive at San Francisco, the first thing you do, write to us the full particulars of your voyage. Don't rely on any letters you may have left on the way. They do not reach the States, particularly from Valparaiso.
</p><p>
Up to November 17, we were totally ignorant of your whereabouts; that was the first we have heard
from your vessel since your departure, that she was spoken, date not given, in lat. 20.20 South and long. 36.30 West. This despatch, though brief and indefinite, conveyed to your friends here the agreeable intelligence that your noble vessel had thus far rode the storms safely.
</p><p>
Letters have been received announcing the safe arrival in San Francisco of all our West Chester boys. Thornbury wrote a letter to you. I opened it. He advises you to content yourself and stay at home. This you receive too late. At the time he wrote this letter he was getting ready to start for the mines. Cale will be surprised to hear of your being in California. Whitaker has written a very long letter which we are setting up for the Record. Poor Bill--he was homesick more than once. From these letters we can form a very good idea of what your hardships and sufferings have been. I am pretty confident, however, that you are fired with energy sufficient to meet them all. For Clint I have my fears. John L. Haines of this place is on his way to California, by the Isthmus route, and is probably there by this time.
</p><p>
I think that you and Clint, with your tools, can do well. You can pass yourselves off for house carpenters. But God only knows what will become of you should you arrive in San Francisco in ill-health and with broken-down constitutions. The fever is down in West Chester and will remain so until we hear of some of our folks finding the "big lumps." Should I hear of you finding plenty, I will immediately start for the gold regions. I will come the Isthmus route. You must give me a true statement of affairs in California, as frequently as you can. Letters come through in twenty and thirty days.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=eap" rel="friend met">Miss Apple</a> was at church this morning. Since your absence, I have frequently called upon her, as an old friend and acquaintance. Her devotion to you is firmly fixed, with a determination to hold out to the last. She was delighted to hear that the Europe had been spoken. Her most intimate female companion now is Miss Annie Hatch.
</p><p>
The editor has been away more than half the time. He was an applicant for the appointment of an European mission and has been on to Washington several times, working with all his energy. He intimated that he would make me a liberal offer, should he be successful, as he and his family would be absent three or four years. In this case I will put the screws on him. I have been waiting for this to take place for some time. But what arrangements would be made in the office I do not know nor do I care much. There is only one contingency which may finally result in favor of the editor.
</p><p>
We have been anxiously waiting for the President's message for the last week, but it has not yet been delivered, the House being unable to elect a speaker.
</p><p>
On Friday last I saw your mother. She looked very well and is in good health. She said she thought it could not be that you had gone to California.
</p><p>
I send you the Record regularly, which will tell of all the news at home. I hope you will receive it. About town the beaux and girls are getting along as usual, very little prospects of any of the ladies getting married. There is no use proposing to them. They appear to be waiting for you California boys, who they expect will have lots of "rocks" when you return. We Gideons are all standing back and do not go it more than once at one place. You may often wonder what I am doing among the ladies. I can sum it up in this brief sentence
--Not anything. But we still have secret foldings, when exceedingly pleasant company collects, to drive away the dullness of West Chester life. John Hunter is going it moderately on Miss Annie Hatch; only for fun, however.
</p><p>
For the last two weeks meetings have been held at the Methodist Church every evening, and a number of converts have been made. In fact, we may say a great revival is going on in our midst. Among those who have been converted and joined church are some of the hardest cases we had about West Chester. I hope they are sincere, and it may do them good. This morning a powerful sermon was preached by some stranger; afterwards about fifteen of these converts were taken on probation as members, among them Miss Elizabeth Hodgson. "Old Dad" often feels solemn but cannot as yet reconcile myself to take the step that some of my companions have. One thing I have done--I have quit swearing. This I am determined to do.
</p><p>
Remember me to Clint, and accept for yourself my heartiest wishes.   <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=pep" rel="me">PEEBLES PRIZER</a>.
</p><p>
Give my love to Bill Whitaker and take some yourself. I hope you may always have plenty of "redboys."
</p><p>
BEN SWENEY.
</p><p>
Give my best respects to all W. C. boys and do not be surprised to see me out there soon.
</p><p>
JNO. W. MILES.
