Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I received your favor of last August, by <a href='/results.php?tla=dah' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Humphreys</a> ; since which I have not written to or 
heard from you. I mention this that you may know no letters have miscarried. 
</p><p>
I took the liberty of addressing my late work, 
" Rights of Man," to you ; but though I left it, at 
that time, to find its way to you, I now request your 
acceptance of fifty copies, as a token of remembrance 
to yourself and my friends. The work has had a 
run beyond any thing that has been published in 
this country on the subject of government ; and the 
demand continues. In Ireland it has had a much 
greater. A letter I received from Dublin, 10th of 
May, mentioned that the fourth edition was then on 
sale. I know not what number of copies were printed at each edition, except the second, which was ten 
thousand. The same fate follows me here, as I at 
first experienced in America, — strong friends and 
violent enemies ; but, as I have got the ear of the 
country, I shall go on, and at least show them, what 
is a novelty here, that there can be a person beyond 
the reach of corruption. 
I arrived here from France about ten days ago. 
M. de Lafayette was well. The affairs of that country are verging to a new crisis, — whether the Government shall be monarchical and hereditary, or wholly 
representative. I think the latter opinion will very 
generally prevail in the end. On this question the 
people are much forwarder than the National Assembly. 
</p><p>
After the establishment of the American Revolution, 
it did not appear to me that any object could arise, 
great enough to engage me a second time. I began 
to feel myself happy in being quiet. But I now experience that principle is not confined to time or 
place, and that the ardor of Seventy-six is capable 
of renewing itself I have another work in hand, 
which I intend shall be my last; for I long much to 
return to America. 
</p><p>
It is not natural that fame should wish for a rival. 
But the case is otherwise with me ; for I do most sincerely wish there was some person in this country 
that could usefully and successfully attract the public 
attention, and leave me with a satisfied mind, to the 
enjoyment of quiet life. But it is painful to see 
errors and abuses, and sit down a senseless spectator. 
Of this, your own mind will interpret mine. 
</p><p>
I have printed sixteen thousand copies. When the whole are gone, of which there remain between three 
and four thousand, I shall then make a cheap edition, just sufficient to bring in the price of the printing and paper, as I did by " Common Sense." 
</p><p>
Mr. Green, who will present you this, has been very much my friend. I wanted, last October, to 
draw for fifty pounds on General Lewis Morris, who has some money of mine ; but as he is unknown in 
the commercial line, and American credit not very good and my own expended, I could not succeed, 
especially as <a href='/results.php?tla=gom' rel='colleague'>Gouverneur Morris</a> was then in Holland. <a href='/results.php?tla=dah' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Humphreys</a> went with me to your agent, Mr. Walsh, to whom I stated the case, and took the liberty of saying, that I knew you would not think it a 
trouble to receive it of General Morris, on Mr. Walsh's account. But he declined it. Mr. Green afterwards 
supplied me, and I have since repaid him. He has a troublesome affair on his hands here, and is in danger of losing thirty or forty thousand pounds, embarked under the flag of the United States, in East 
India property. The persons who have received it, withhold it, and shelter themselves under some law 
contrivance. He wishes to state the case to Congress, not only on his own account, but as a matter that may be nationally interesting. 
</p><p>
The public papers will inform you of the riots and 
tumults at Birmingham, and of some disturbances at 
Paris; and, as Mr. Green can detail them to you 
more particularly than I can do in a letter, I leave 
those matters to his information. I am. Sir, with 
affectionate concern for your happiness and Mrs. 
Washington's, &c.,
