<a href='/results.php?city=camden' rel='city origin'>CAMDEN</a>, S. C., <a rel='month origin' value='5'>May</a> <a rel='day origin' value='8'>8</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1864' rel="origin">1864</a>. My -friends crowded around me so in those last days in Richmond, I for 
got the affairs of this nation utterly ; though I did show faith in my Confederate country by buying poor 
Bones's (my English maid s) Confederate bonds. I gave her gold thimbles, bracelets ; whatever was gold and would 
sell in New York or London, I gave. 
</p><p>
My friends in Richmond grieved that I had to leave them not half so much, however, as I did that I must 
come away. Those last weeks were so pleasant. No battle, no murder, no sudden death, all went merry as a marriage 
bell. Clever, cordial, kind, brave friends rallied around me.

Maggie Howell and I went down the river to see an exchange of prisoners. Our party were the Lees, Mallorys, 
Mrs. Buck Allan, Mrs. Ould. We picked up Judge Ould and Buck Allan at Curl's Neck. I had seen no genuine 
Yankees before ; prisoners, well or wounded, had been German, Scotch, or Irish. Among our men coming ashore was 
an officer, who had charge of some letters for a friend of mine whose fiance had died ; I gave him her address. One 
other man showed me some wonderfully ingenious things 
he had made while a prisoner. One said they gave him rations for a week ; he always devoured them in three days, he 
could not help it; and then he had to bear the inevitable agony of those four remaining days ! Many were wounded, 
some were maimed for life. They were very cheerful. We had supper or some nondescript meal with ice-cream 
on board. The band played Home, Sweet Home. 
</p><p>
One man tapped another on the shoulder : Well, how do you feel, old fellow? " " Never was so near crying in 
my life for very comfort." 
</p><p>
Governor Cummings, a Georgian, late Governor of Utah, was among the returned prisoners. He had been in prison 
two years. His wife was with him. He was a striking-looking person, huge in size, and with snow-white hair, fat 
as a prize ox, with no sign of Yankee barbarity or starvation about him. 
</p><p>
That evening, as we walked up to <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis's</a> carriage, which was waiting for us at the landing, Dr. Garnett 
with Maggie Howell, Major Hall with me, suddenly I heard her scream, and some one stepped back in the dark and 
said in a whisper. " Little Joe! he has killed him self! : I felt reeling, faint, bewildered. A chattering 
woman clutched my arm: " <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis's</a> son? Impossible. Whom did you say? Was he an interesting child? How 
old was he? : The shock was terrible, and unnerved as I was I cried, "For God's sake take her away ! " 
</p><p>
Then Maggie and I drove two long miles in silence except for Maggie's hysterical sobs. She was wild with terror. The news was broken to her in that abrupt way at the carriage door so that at first she thought it had all happened there, and that poor little Joe was in the carriage.

Mr. Burton Harrison met us at the door of the Executive Mansion. Mrs. Semmes and Mrs. Barksdale were there, 
too. Every window and door of the house seemed wide 
open, and the wind was blowing the curtains. It was lighted, even in the third story. As I sat in the drawing-room, I 
could hear the tramp of <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis's</a> step as he walked up and down the room above. Not another sound. The whole 
house as silent as death. It was then twelve o clock; so I 
went home and waked General Chesnut, who had gone to bed. We went immediately back to the President's, 
found Mrs. Semmes still tkere, but saw no one but her. We thought some friends of the family ought to be in the house. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Semmes said when she got there that little Jeff was kneeling down by his brother, and he called out to her 
in great distress : " Mrs. Semmes, I have said all the prayers I know how, but God will not wake Joe. 
</p><p>
Poor little Joe, the good child of the family, was so Gentle and affectionate. He used to run in to say his prayers at 
his father's knee. Now he was laid out somewhere above us, crushed and killed. Mrs. Semmes, describing the accident, 
said he fell from the high north piazza upon a brick pavement. Before I left the house I saw him lying there, white 
and beautiful as an angel, covered with flowers ; Catherine, his nurse, flat on the floor by his side, was weeping and wailing as only an Irishwoman can. 
</p><p>
Immense crowds came to the funeral, everybody sympathetic, but some shoving and pushing rudely. There were 
thousands of children, and each child had a green bough or a bunch of flowers to throw on little Joe's grave, which was 
already a mass of white flowers, crosses, and evergreens. The morning I came away from <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis's</a>, early as it 
was, I met a little child with a handful of snow drops. Put these on little Joe, she said ; "I knew him so well", 
and then she turned and fled without another word. I did not know who she was then or now. 
</p><p>
As I walked home I met Mr. Reagan, then Wade Hampton. But I could see nothing but little Joe and his broken 
hearted mother. And <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Davis's</a> step still sounded in my ears as he walked that floor the livelong night. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=rel' rel='acquaintance met'>General Lee</a> was to have a grand review the very day we left Richmond. Great numbers of people were to go up by 
rail to see it. Miss Turner McFarland writes : "They did go, but they came back faster than they went. They found 
the army drawn up in battle array." Many of the brave and gay spirits that we saw so lately have taken flight, the 
only flight they know, and their bodies are left dead upon the battle-field. Poor old Edward Johnston is wounded 
again, and a prisoner. Jones's brigade broke first ; he was wounded the day before. 
</p><p>
At Wilmington we met General Whiting. He sent us to the station in his carriage, and bestowed upon us a bottle of 
brandy, which had run the blockade. They say <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> 
has taken his sword from Whiting. Never ! I will not believe it. At the capture of Fort Sumter they said Whiting 
was the brains, <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> only the hand. Lucifer, son of the morning! How art thou fallen! That they should 
even say such a thing! 
</p><p>
My husband and Mr. Covey got out at Florence to procure for Mrs. Miles a cup of coffee. They were slow about 
it and they got left. I did not mind this so very much, for I remembered that we were to remain all day at Kingsville, 
and that my husband could overtake me there by the next train. My maid belonged to the Prestons. She w't as only 
traveling home with me, and would go straight on to Columbia. So without fear I stepped off at Kingsville. My old 
Confederate silk, like most Confederate dresses, had seen better days, and I noticed that, like Oliver Wendell Holmes's famous " one-hoss shay," it had gone to pieces suddenly, and all over. It was literally in strips. I became 
painfully aware of my forlorn aspect when I asked the telegraph man the way to the hotel, and he was by no means respectful to me. I was, indeed, alone an old and not too respectable-looking woman. It was my first appearance in the character, and I laughed aloud. 
</p><p>
A very haughty and highly painted dame greeted me at the hotel. " No room," said she. " Who are you? " 
I gave my name. Try something else, said she. Mrs. Chesnut don't travel round by herself with no servants and 
no nothing. I looked down. There I was, dirty, tired, tattered, and torn. " Where do you come from? " said she. 
</p><p>
" My home is in Camden." " Come, now, I know every body in Camden." I sat down meekly on a bench in the 
piazza, that was free to all wayfarers. 
</p><p>
"Which Mrs. ChesnuU " said she (sharply). "I know both. " "I am now the only one. And now what is 
the matter with you ? Do you take me for a spy ? I know you perfectly well. I went to school with you at Miss Henrietta de Leon's, and my name was Mary Miller." "The Lord sakes alive! and to think you are her! Now I see. 
Dear! dear me! Heaven sakes, woman, but you are broke! : " And tore," I added, holding up my dress. 
But I had had no idea it was so difficult to effect an entry into a railroad wayside hotel. I picked up a long strip of 
my old black dress, torn off by a man's spur as I passed him getting off the train. 
</p><p>
It is sad enough at Mulberry without old Mrs. Chesnut, who was the good genius of the place. It is so lovely here 
in spring. The giants of the forest the primeval oaks, water-oaks, live-oaks, willow-oaks, such as I have not seen 
since I left here with opopanax, violets, roses, and yellow jessamine, the air is laden with perfume. Araby the Blest 
was never sweeter. 
</p><p>
Inside, are creature comforts of all kinds green peas, strawberries, asparagus, spring lamb, spring chicken, fresh 
eggs, rich, yellow butter, clean white linen for one's beds, dazzling white damask for one's table. It is such a contrast 
to Richmond, where I wish I were. 
</p><p>
Fighting is going on. Hampton is frantic, for his laggard new regiments fall in slowly ; no fault of the soldiers ; 
they are as disgusted as he is. Bragg, Bragg, the head of the War Office, can not organize in time. 
</p><p>
John Boykin has died in a Yankee prison. He had on a heavy flannel shirt when lying in an open platform car on 
the way to a cold prison on the lakes. A Federal soldier wanted John's shirt. Prisoners have no rights ; so John 
had to strip off and hand his shirt to him. That caused his death. In two days he was dead of pneumonia may be 
frozen to death. One man said : They are taking us there 
to freeze. But then their men will find our hot sun in August and July as deadly as our men find their cold Decembers. Their snow and ice finish our prisoners at a rapid rate, they say. Napoleon's soldiers found out all that in 
the Russian campaign. 
</p><p>
Have brought my houseless, homeless friends, refugees 
here, to luxuriate in Mulberry's plenty. I can but remember the lavish kindness of the Virginia people when I was 
there and in a similar condition. The Virginia people do the rarest acts of hospitality and never seem to know it is 
not in the ordinary course of events. 
</p><p>
The President's man, Stephen, bringing his master's Arabian to Mulberry for safe-keeping, said : Why, Missis, 
your niggers down here are well off. I call this Mulberry place heaven, with plenty to eat, little to do, warm 
house to sleep in, a good church." 
</p><p>
John L. Miller, my cousin, has been killed at the head of his regiment. The blows now fall so fast on our heads 
they are bewildering. The Secretary of War authorizes General Chesnut to reorganize the men who have been hitherto detailed for special duty, and also those who have been exempt. He says General Chesnut originated the plan and 
organized the corps of clerks which saved Richmond in the Dahlgren raid.
