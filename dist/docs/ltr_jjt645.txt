My dear Sister
</p><p>
Your letter enclosing the check came safely & relieved my mind from apprehensions of your health being seriously ill. We have closed our examinations and I hope that on Thursday next I will be able to leave. I have some concern about getting from home to Goshen, but I trust that I will not experience much pain as I design going in my carriage.

I don't feel so well today as usual, but I have been exercising probably too much as I am at the Institute for the 3rd time. I think that my general health is better than it has been for a year or two at this season of the year, but much exercise appears to bring on increased trouble and pain. If I do not improve greatly between this time & the time that I reach N.Y. I will pass directly through and leave your purchases til my return.

Write to me at Brattleboro Vermont as I design going to a Hydropathic establishment there. If I should not stop as I go through N.Y., I will write to two different establishments there and find out on what terms they will furnish the furniture, so that on my return it will only be necessary to examine the furniture & make the purchases. In your next letter, tell me to whom I must direct your purchases. I expect that it will be cheaper to send them by water to Baltimore & from Balt. by Rail Road. If so it would be necessary to send them to somebody in Balt. as well as to some one at Webster or the stopping Depot on the R.R. Anna don't know of my writing this letter as I am at the Institute, or she might have some special message. Her health is much better than usual & I trust that through the blessing of God she will be restored this summer. Much love to all.
