MY DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
On the 3d instant I was favored with your Excellency's letter of the 30th ultimo. I have, for ten 
days successively, deferred writing, in hopes that I 
should have been able, at last, to have advised you 
that public business was closely attended to in this 
quarter, and that we had adopted measures to disencumber us from that variety of embarrassment we 
experience ; but, alas ! we have made little or no advances. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague met'>Mifflin</a>, Pickering, Jones, and General Sherman, 
have furnished the first part of a voluminous system 
for the Quarter-master's department. The second part 
is to direct the Commissary-General of Issues in the 
discharge of his duty; and the third will point at 
the regulations for the Hospital. I do not mention 
the Purchasing department, because that is to be abolished ; the States are to do all. As General Sher 
man roundly asserts, that system will strike off four-thousand officers from the civil departments. As it is, 
replete with absurdity, it will pass into a law, unless 
it should be thought proper to confer with the Commander-in-chief on the subject. There has been some 
wicked work, respecting a certain appointment, which 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>General Greene</a> will advise you of verbally. 
</p><p>
The gentleman I have last mentioned addressed 
Congress, in a letter of the 3d instant, wishing for 
their sense on his general conduct in the Quarter 
master's department. A resolution was proposed, that 
Congress had full confidence in his integrity and 
ability, and requesting his future exertions. This 
brought on much debate ; amendments were moved, 
and the House got into heats, and an adjournment 
was deemed necessary to give the members time to 
cool. A member, more zealous for the General's reputation than prudent, observed, that he was an officer in whom the Commander-in-chief had the highest 
confidence; that he was the first of all the subordinate Generals in point of military knowledge and 
ability ; that, in case of an accident happening to 
General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, he would be the properest per 
son to command the army; and that General Washing 
ton thought so too. Another observed, that he had a 
very high opinion of <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>General Greene's</a> military abilities ; that he believed the General had too ; but that 
he believed no person on earth was authorized to say 
as much as the words, above scored, implied. I mention this, that your Excellency may guard against 
any misapprehensions which this may occasion with 
your officers. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>General Greene</a> will inform you who 
delivered the imprudent speech. 
</p><p>
Yesterday your letter of the 2d was read. There 
appeared a disposition in many to leave the whole 
business, which was the subject of it, to your discretion. Great part of the morning was spent on the 
subject before the resolution took place, which will 
be transmitted by the President. 
</p><p>
Some days since, I moved for a Committee to prepare a letter to the States, to call on them for exertions more competent to the great object we have in 
view. After some altercation, a Committee was appointed. Ellsworth, Muhlenberg, and Schuyler composed it. They prepared the letter, and reported but 
some gentlemen were averse at the decisive plainness 
with which we intended Congress should address the 
States ; whilst others contended that we should speak 
still more pointedly. After a whole day's debate, the 
letter was recommitted. 
</p><p>
I have entreated <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>General Greene</a> to remain a day 
or two longer in town, that I may be able to advise 
with him on the measures necessary to be pursued 
to prevent the ill consequences of his being driven 
to the necessity of a resignation, which, I conceive, 
would at any time be an event to be much lamented, but, in the present conjuncture, ruinous. 
</p><p>
Pray entreat Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> to accept of my respects, and the gentlemen of the family those wishes 
which my esteem for them indus. I am, dear Sir, 
with perfect esteem, and the sincerest affection, 
Your Excellency's obedient servant, 
</p><p>
