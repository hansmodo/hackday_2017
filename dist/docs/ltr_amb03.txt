Hello Again -<br><br>
I am constantly blinking and shaking my head these days, as I am spending a lot of time in court.
Plato's words about justice, truth, knowledge, ignorance keep coming to mind. I have been in a 
custody battle for about 3 years. The legal profession is becoming more and more familiar to me,
as is the judicial system. It's times like this that I really miss talking to your father.<br><br>
In the spring of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1974">1974</a> I flew to Palo Alto to see Hayden. I was having a fairly intense existential crisis,
and he held out a "helping hand". He was there for me to talk to, in a way that I'm sure he had wanted 
someone to be sure he had wanted someone to be there for him as he grew up. My memories, somewhat like yours,
are  a little nebulous and colored by emotion.<br><br>
Your father approached life with such a sharp, penetrating mind that he often expressed an honesty that was
hard to understand at times, and very uncomfortable for some people to be around. He wasn't a critical man
in a negative way, rather he seemed to live life with a childlike sense of fun, and curiosity. His ability 
to consider ideas drove some people away from him, because they were either too stupid, or too ignorant. There
were times I think that he felt extremely misunderstood, rejected, and lonely. These are, in my opinion, the 
times when he probably acted self-destructively and irresponsibly. He was not ever mean spirited in my memories of him,
but caring and loving. I have an image of him as the heartbroken clown, unable to live with his own satirical genius.
(Did you see the movie Cabaret? Do you remember the Master of Ceremony character played by Joel Gray?)<br><br>
Let me play back a few scenes: I got off of a plane in San Francisco. Hayden was supposed to meet me, but at first 
no one was there. I began walking down the corridor, passing the cocktail lounge. I don't remember all the details,
but I somehow found Hayden. He was all dressed up in a business suit, with rather long, wavy reddish-brown hair 
and bright blue eyes. He came towards me grinning a big smile, and he was obviously a bit drunk. He gave me a big hug,
and as I walked back towards the parking lot with him, he realized that he had forgotten where he had parked the car.
I do not advocate getting drunk, but somehow I had so much fun laughing and joking as we walked all over the airport 
parking lots looking for his car! <br><br>
There was another time when Hayden showed me an acceptance letter from Stanford Law School. He then told me that he 
had created a phony transcript at Foothill College and managed to place it in their files. He was found out later he
said, because of some detail he didn't notice on the transcript, but he giggled with glee at the joke. I don't know 
if he even cared about being a lawyer.<br><br>
Another time he took me along to meet some of his friends. They were having a party; casual, post-hippie-era types.
He was a well-liked guy, and we partied all night long until we simply fell asleep on the couches. Gail was understandably
angry at Hayden the next day for not coming home and not calling, but I remember what a great times he and I had that
night, and I was so happy to be with my brother.<br><br>
That summer of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1974">1974</a> I lived with Hayden and Gail and you and Heidi. Hayden and Gail both showed  me a lot of love, and I 
went to Foothill college that summer taking an English class, and an art class. Hayden showed me bits of San Francisco, 
and the beaches and hills in the area. Hayden spent a lot of time with me, talking about my problems and showing me his 
interests such as music, and camping out on the beach. I talked with him about education, and how confused I was by the 
disparity I saw between formal schooling and real knowledge. He understood me, and I understood him. Why had it taken so long
for us to really meet? The age difference was part of it.<br><br>
There was a late night conversation in the kitchen one time, when Hayden told me how much he wanted to talk with Harvey, but
when he tried to really reach Harvey with anything beyond the superficial bullshit-of-the-day, Harvey shut down and rejected
him. Hayden began to get tears in his eyes, and I more than felt Hayden's loneliness - I felt the same way about our family,
and I also knew the pain.<br><br>
You know, I believe it was <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1974">1974</a>, (or 1975?) when I wrote Hayden from Lloyd Harbor, Long Island, N. Y. I was in a very unconventional
college, which did not assign grades, and which involved living all around the world, pursuing a particular interest, and
tracing the influence of 3 different cultures on that interest. We were then to write a graduation "Thesis" summarizing everything.
A great idea, but often very impractical due to the extremely high costs, and lack of structure. Anyway  - I digress. Hayden and I
had talked in California about this college (Friends World College). I was in my 1st year in N. Y., and I wrote him. I got his reply
letter soon thereafter. He talked in this letter about how he felt that he was about to go through some kind of change (or transformation?)
but he didn't really know what it would be. Shortly thereafter, (a month or so?) I received a phone call (from Laurie, I think) that
Hayden was dead. I cannot, even now, put my sorrow into words. Hayden was a best friend, a genius, a jester, a soul mate.<br><br>
I do not know where Hayden is buried. I did not go to the funeral. To me, physical remains are just that - "ashes to ashes." I taught anatomy 
lab to medical school students last year, and while I am truly awestruck by the human body as I dissect it, I also do not see it as "that
person". I sometimes felt what I thought may have been a spiritual presence at a particular body, but I also felt that the spirit was 
no longer living in that body... but perhaps observing me?<br><br>
Hayden's death devastated me. Hans - do you know where your father is buried? I would like, at some point, to visit his grave, or know what
happened to his body.<br><br>
Do you keep in touch with Gail? How id she? Where is she?<br><br>
One of your father's favorite TV shows, (not that he watched much TV) was I think called Kung Fu. Where the little boy grows up in a Zen 
monastery, and becomes a marshal arts master and holy man? I happened (by chance) to see part of an episode this week, and at one moment
the main character (Cain) said to one of the "western unenlightened people" : "as I grew up, I was taught - a long life is the same as a short
life. They are both but moments in time."<br><br>
love,<br>

Write, little grasshopper, when the wind is blowing in the right direction.
