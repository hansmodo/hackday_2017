Dear Brother : The rapid change in our military condition in Kentucky drew to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a> an immense body 
of irregular forces as well as a large number of the new 
regiments. I went there with the intention, if advisable, to go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a>, but all thought it wrong for me 
to venture. . . . 
</p><p>
Since the date of your letter the condition of affairs 
has changed very much for the worse. The sudden over 
running of Kentucky, the surrender of Murfreesville, 
the battle of Richmond, the long and unaccountable 
delay of Buell, have all combined to make a gloomy 
feeling here, but do not affect the resolution to fight this 
war to a successful conclusion. We are now anxiously 
awaiting further movements in Kentucky by Buell. If 
he fails it is manifest a year is lost and our new levies 
will have to commence the war in the West over again. 
The terrible battles in Maryland and the retreat of the 
rebels into Virginia give only a ray of comfort, for we 
lost more than we gained. The surrender at Harper's 
Ferry loses us more material of war than the entire 
train of rebels is worth. And even now it is uncertain 
whether the retreat into Virginia is not a part of the 
plan of operations originally designed to carry the war 
into Western Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio. As one 
of the bad signs I regret to notice so many quarrels 
between officers. . . . 
</p><p>
The feeling among the people is general that the regular officers are indisposed to treat with decent civility 
those who, like most of the great military men of history, are educated in the field rather than in the school. 
And it is feared that habits of education and association 
make them feel indifferent of the success of the war 
fighting rather from a pride of duty than from an earnest 
conviction that the rebellion must be put down with 
energy. Since <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a> went to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> every movement is left to him absolutely. No interference or even 
advice is tendered. He has chosen his own officers, and 
if he fails I see nothing left but for the people to resort 
to such desperate means as the French and English did 
in their revolutions. 
</p><p>
I am rejoiced that you have been able to keep out of 
the adversities that have befallen us. Your course in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a> is judicious. Your speech I can heartily endorse. I hope you can maintain yourself at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a> 
until relieved, and I have no doubt you will fill an honorable place in the history of our times. By the way, I 
received within a day or two a letter from a gentleman 
of the highest political status containing this passage : 
"Within the last few days I heard an officer say he 
heard your brother the General, abuse you roundly at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=corinth" rel="city">Corinth</a> as one of the blank abolitionists who had brought 
on the war, and that he was ashamed to own you as a 
brother." I have no doubt the officer said this but I 
knew you did not, and so contradicted it with decided 
emphasis. I only repeat it now to show you how persistently efforts are being made to separate the class of 
high regular officers to which you belong from civilians. 
Whenever that separation is effected all important commands will gradually be transferred to such officers as 
Banks, Sigel, Morgan, Nelson, and to such regular officers as show a sympathy with the Kadical faction, as 
Hunter, Fremont and Doubleday. I earnestly deprecate all such tendencies. I want the war conducted 
regularly according to the tenets of civilized warfare. 
I prefer regular officers and scarcely ever criticise them 
and never in public, but if the time shall come when 
emancipation of blacks and civilization of whites is necessary in order to preserve the unity of this country, 
then I would prefer a fanatic like John Brown to lead 
our armies and an abolitionist like Chase with brains 
and energy to guide our counsels.

Affectionately yours,
