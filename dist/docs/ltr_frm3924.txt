SIR: 
</p><p>
Yesterday I received a letter from Major Call, at Smith s, in Goose Creek. By his account, he expected the enemy was out; but I have 
heard from Haddrell's and Daniel's Island late yesterday, and no troops are out. Marquis Rockingham's death has made a change of ministers, 
Lord Shelburn at the head, who is our most inveterate enemy, which I conceive will prolong the war ; however, I have certain intelligence that 
steps are still taken to evacuate, and am very sanguine it will take place by the 15th of next month. If your cavalry will take post on 
Goose Creek, it would secure my right, and I would have a better opportunity to shut up my left; they being so near in your front, would 
prevent every necessary from being carried in town, and secure your position and mine; the communication would be so near each other, 
that a reciprocal support would be had in three hours. I must beg pardon for this hint; I wish not to exceed the station I am in, and pay every deference to your judgment. Should the enemy attempt 
me, I am determined not to quit this ground without I am forced. I have now thrice the number of men in the field that I had when Frazer 
made his appearance, and I trust I can make my men stand their ground. I could wish a more frequent intercourse of intelligence could 
be between us. At present I am acting without the materials from the Southward to form a judgment of my security. I have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant,
