MY DEAR CUTTS, I inclose for your amusement a few papers of the latest date. 
You will see that the Constitution has returned from France, and that an arrival 
from Great Britain has brought the speech opening the British Parliament. The latter decides nothing as to a change of the 
Cabinet, or repeal of the Orders in Council. Its tone on the whole is not arrogant. It 
is silent as to Russia and to Ireland, and as to trade and revenue. Distress may possibly supply motives, which ought to be 
found in wisdom and justice, but it is to be hoped that our National Councils will rely 
less on either than on our measures. We learn from France that Barlow is engaged 
in discussions which encourage his hope of doing something valuable. The return of 
the Hornet will enable us to form a more decided judgment. The repeal of the decrees of B. A. M. is a fact nowise in 
question there, though still a topic of malignant cavil here. A very large batch of 
the nominations for the army of 25,000 went in to the Senate to-day, and it will 
soon be followed by others. General Dearborn is with us and lends a helping hand. 
We are well, and offer affectionate salutations to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="kin met">Anna</a> and yourself. We hope to 
see you all in the spring, and that you will pass the interim with us at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=montpelier" rel="city">Montpelier</a>. 
</p><p>
Yours,
