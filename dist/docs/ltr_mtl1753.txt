MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ezk" rel="met friend">LIZZIE</a> : You will think I am sending you a deluge of letters. I am so very sad to 
day, that I feel that I must write you. I went out last evening with Tad, on a little business, in 
a street car, heavily veiled, very imprudently having my month's living in my pocket-book 
and, on return, found it gone. The loss I deserve for being so careless, but it comes very 
hard on poor me. Troubles and misfortunes are fast overwhelming me ; may the end soon come. 
I lost $82, and quite a new pocket-book. I am very, very anxious about that bill B. & K. may 
bring in. Do go, dear Lizzie, and implore them to be moderate, for I am in a very narrow place. 
Tell them, I pray you, of this last loss. As they have not been successful (BETWEEN OURSELVES), 
and only given me great sorrow and trouble, I think their demand should be very small. (Do 
not mention this to them.) Do, dear Lizzie, go to 609, and talk to them on this subject. Let my 
things be sent to me immediately, and do see to it, that nothing is left behind. I can afford to 
lose nothing they have had placed in their hands. I am literally suffering for my black dress. Will 
you send it to me when you receive this ? I am looking very shabby. I hope you have entirely 
recovered. Write when you receive this. 
</p><p>
Very truly yours,<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mtl" rel="me">M. L.</a>
