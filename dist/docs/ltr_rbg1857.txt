Your letters My beloved Brother, are the day spring of My life and make me feel young again- through the warmth 
of the affection they express- .... we are very much here, as you left us, and our city is so quiet, that if we did not 
know what a dreadful struggle is going on- and witness the squalid appearance of sick soldiers returned from the war- 
and read the more appalling accounts of the battle fields and hospitals we might enjoy the beautiful season, flourishing 
around us- the Flowers seem to spring up every where- the bounties of Nature, seem to reproach the wickedness of man 
in this unholy strife- and Women too ! more monstrous still, who step out of the sphere God designed them to fill in such 
times of trouble- I imitate you My dear Brother and never discuss the vexed question with our opponents in politics- 
</p><p>
We talk of you daily & nightly- we had a very interesting visit from our friend Fanny Kemble- who sails soon for 
England- God bless you dearest Ben.

Ever your devoted <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rbg" rel="me">RG</a>
