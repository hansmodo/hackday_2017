The dry season is nearly over. In a few weeks we may expect to be deluged in mud and water. But now the mountains, the valleys, and the plains all look as parched and dusty as if a drop of rain had never fallen upon them. In spring the mountains are covered with luxuriant verdure and the plains
bespangled with numberless rich and wild flowers, all a field of beauty on too grand a scale for the pencil of the painter to imitate. The burning sun of the Dry Season destroys this magnificent picture and makes everything present a barren and desolate appearance. In many respects the people of California are peculiarly blessed. The climate is one of the most delightful and healthy in the world.

The agricultural resources of California have been rated too high by some and too low by others. One who has seen it in springtime only, represents the whole country as a luxuriant garden; another who has seen it only in the summer or just before the rain set in, represents it as a barren, desolate waste. These pictures, however, are drawn by superficial observers. Where land is properly irrigated it will produce almost any kind of grain or vegetable that is found in the Atlantic States, and in as large quantities.

Cattle will graze in the mountains or on the river bottoms the whole year round. When the dry season comes on, the grass is not spoiled by dews or moisture of any kind, and dries up like sweet, well-made hay. On this, cattle will feed equally as well as on green grass.

A few days since, a deer, chased by a pack of dogs, becoming bewildered, ran through the principal street of the city and entered a drinking saloon kept by a Frenchman. The doors and windows of the establishment were immediately well-guarded and Mr. Deer was soon captured.

Miners are not now doing so well as formerly. While some have made fortunes, the great mass have not averaged more than three or four dollars per day. The placer diggings of this country have been yielding a
good return to the industrious fortune seeker, but owing to the want of water, many have abandoned these diggings and commenced a new kind of mining. New developments have been made daily in the rich quartz veins which abound in every part of the State, some of them containing untold fortunes. One company, about eight miles from this place, have taken out in a few weeks over half a million of dollars. Another company about a mile from this city, have within the last four weeks taken out between thirty-five and forty thousand dollars. As much as sixty to seventy thousand dollars have been taken out of a single claim, but in most cases they have had their labor for their pains.

Foreigners have not been allowed to possess any interest whatever in any quartz vein, although they have not been prevented from making contracts for working the veins, for an interest in the proceeds or on wages. Every claim of one hundred feet or more must be marked out and the names of the claimants posted on it.

Indeed, this branch of mining is just in its infancy, but it has been demonstrated that nearly all the quartz veins in the country will pay handsomely when proper machinery is erected for crushing the quartz rock and extracting the gold therefrom. In less than a year from now we may reasonably expect to see machinery erected on nearly every hilltop for the purpose of grinding the quartz rock.
