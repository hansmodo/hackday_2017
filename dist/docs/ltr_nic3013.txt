SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor, in which you assure me 
you will recommend this unhappy Colony to the continental Congress, hath been laid before the General 
Assembly, to whom it gave great satisfaction. 
</p><p>
I inclose you a copy of Colonel Babcock's dismis 
sion. The office of Brigadier-General is still kept 
vacant, in hopes that the brigade will be put upon 
the Continental establishment, and that a Commander-in-chief will be appointed by Congress. 
</p><p>
I also inclose a copy of an act, discharging the inhabitants of this Colony from allegiance to the King of Great Britain, which was carried in the House of Deputies, after a debate, with but six dissentient voices, there being upwards of sixty members present. I may also inform your Excellency, that the Delegates 
from this Colony are instructed and authorized to 
join with the major part of the Delegates in entering  into a treaty with any Prince, State, or Potentate for the security of the Colonies, and to adopt 
any other measures that may be thought prudent and 
effectual. This instruction passed ncm. con. 
</p><p>
The Lower House afterwards passed a vote for 
taking the sense of the inhabitants at large, upon 
the question of Independence ; but the Upper House 
having represented to them, that it would probably 
be discussed in Congress before the sense of the 
inhabitants could be taken, and transmitted to the 
Delegates, in which case the Colony would lose their 
voice, as the Delegates would be laid under the necessity of waiting for instructions from their constituents, and further observed that the Delegates, 
when they should receive a copy of the vote, renouncing  allegiance to the British King, and their instructions, could not possibly be at a loss to know the 
sentiments of the General Assembly, upon this the 
matter was dropped. 
</p><p>
I have also the satisfaction to inform your Excellency that, at a very full town-meeting of the inhabitants of Newport, held last Monday, it was unanimously voted to enter into the defence of the town; 
and last Thursday a considerable body of them began 
to work upon the fort to be erected upon Brenton's 
Point. This happy event, I have great hopes, will 
make us an united people, and root up every seed 
of disaffection in the Colony. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty, once more, to press your Excellency in behalf of the Colony, the defence of which must be abandoned unless we receive assistance from 
the Congress. I am, with great respect, Sir, your 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
P. S. By this day's post I have forwarded to Mr. Hopkins an instruction from the General Assembly, 
directing him to make immediate application to congress to put our troops upon the Continental establishment.
