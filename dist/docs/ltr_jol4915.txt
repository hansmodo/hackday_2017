My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I wish it were in my power to enter properly into the different subjects which compose your letter of the 20th . In my present circumstances I must content 
myself with writing you a short and hasty epistle. The particulars of the aifair alluded to by the Chevalier de Failly, I took it for granted you would have 
received in your official letter, and therefore regretted the less my want of time to inform you properly of it. 
The matter was in brief as follows : when we march'd from Whitemarah Camp, and were in the act of crossing the Schuylkil, we received intelligence that the 
enemy were advancing on this side of the river; infact a ravaging party of four thousand under the command of Lord Cornwallis had pass'd the river and 
were driving Potter's Militia before them. Two regiments of this corps, however, are said to have conducted 
themselves extremely well and to have given the enemy no small annoyance as they advanced. <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>General Sullivan</a> was Major Gen'l of the day and consequently conducted the march. 
</p><p>
His division and part of Wayne's had cross'd the river; being uncertain as to the number of the enemy, and dreading their advance in force. When 
part of the army should be on one side of the river and part on the other he order'd those troops to recross and our bridge to be render'd impassible. 
</p><p>
Notice of this was sent to the Commander in Chief, 
and when he arrived parties of the enemy were seen 
on the commanding heights on this side of the river. 
There was a pause for some time and consultation what 
was to be done; parties of horse in the mean time 
were detached to gain certain intelligence of the enemy's number and designs. 
</p><p>
It was considered that our army was near a river 
to which it had march'd by a narrow road, on each 
side of which thick woods render'd it impossible for the army to display itself; and that if sir Wm Howe sh'd 
keep up a show on the opposite side Schuylkil, and at 
the same time march in force from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> upon 
us, we must in these circumstances inevitably be 
ruined. Some pronounced hastily that the enemy had 
received intelligence of our march, although the resolution had been taken in council only the night before, 
and that they were prepared to oppose our passage. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>Gen'l Washington</a> who never since I have been in his 
family has pass'd a false judgment on such points, 
gave it as his opinion that the party in view were 
foragers ; that the meeting was accidental, but, how 
ever, the enemy might avail themselves of this unexpected discovery, and might draw as much advantage 
from it as if the rencounter had been premeditated. 
</p><p>
The intelligence was received that the enemy were 
retiring in great haste, but it did not appear satisfactory, 
and the army was ordered to march to the Swedes 
Ford three or four miles higher up the river and 
encamp with the right to the Schuylkil. The next 
morning the want of provisions I could weep tears of 
blood when I say it the want of provisions render'd it 
impossible to march. We did not march till the evening of that day. Our ancient bridge, an infamous 
construction which in many parts obliged the men to 
march by Indian file, was restored, and a bridge of waggons made over the Swedes Ford, but fence-rails 
from necessity being substituted to plank, and furnishing a very unstable footing, this last served to cross a 
trifling number of troops. As the event turn'd out <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a>'s retrograde movement was unspeakably 
unlucky. If we had persevered in crossing in the 
first instance, or if we had even crossed in the evening 
of the first day, the flower of the British army must 
have fallen a sacrifice to superior numbers. 
</p><p>
Among the parties of horse that were out upon this 
occasion a small detachment of Bland's Regiment 
composed of trumpeter, farrier, and whatever could 
be collected for the moment, their Col. at their head, 
charged a serjeant and guard of Hessians and took 
them all prisoners. 
</p><p>
On the 19th inst. we march'd from the Gulph to this 
camp, head quarters at the Valley forge. 
</p><p>
On the 22 nd at night we received intelligence of a 
large foraging party of the enemy having pass'd the 
Schuylkil. Last evening the 22 d Gen'l Potter wrote us 
that General Howe is with the foragers, from whence 
we conclude that the greatest part of his army is with 
him. They encamped on the other side of Derby 
last night will you believe it starving in a plentiful country. The utmost we could do was to dispatch 
small parties draughted from each brigade last night, and to take extraordinary means for furnishing the army with provisions to enable a more respectable force to inarch to the enemy. L'd Stirling's Division 
march cl to-day in order to cover the country and observe the enemy's motions till something more effectual can be done. 
</p><p>
I have inquired whence this defect in the Commissariat Department arises; but this must be defer'd 
till I next have the pleasure of writing to you. I have 
barely time to repeat my prayers for your speedy recovery, and the assurances of the boundless love of your
