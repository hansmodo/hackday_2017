MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
</p><p>
I arrived here in about twenty-four hours after I 
left you; have collected powder, so as to make up 
near thirty barrels, and have since been preparing to 
set an example to the other seaports, by setting the 
fleet at defiance. Upon my arrival, I was surprised 
to find that the boom, so much talked of, was not 
prepared ; that the bridge intended for crossing from 
the main to the islands, whereon stands the principal fort (called Fort Washington), had nothing 
more done than one pier sunk ; that there was not 
a foot of the parapet, over which a man might 
fire, or even see his enemy ; that the embrasures 
at the foot were horizontal, as well as the top of 
the parapet; and, in short, not a moment's defence 
could be made, or annoyance given to the enemy, 
either with cannon or small arms. 
</p><p>
I immediately collected a number of gondolas, 
moored them head and stern, laid pieces from one 
to the other, and plank across, and soon completed 
the bridge. I then turned my attention to the 
boom, and in two days got it across, but found it 
could not stand the rapidity of the tide ; it soon 
broke, and W T C have again fixed it, so that I hope 
it may hold; but lest it should deceive us, I have 
taken a number of ships, and moored them above, 
with a great quantity of combustible matter in 
them, and shall to-morrow have them chained together, and, in case the boom should give way, 
set those vessels in flames. I have also a great 
number of fire-rafts, ready to let loose upon them. 
</p><p>
I have altered the works, and I trust made them 
fit for defence, and I doubt not will, in two or 
three days more, be completely prepared. I am 
extremely thankful to your Excellency for the rifle 
men sent to our assistance ; it has indeed filled 
our people with gratitude ; and that my coming 
down was equally agreeable, your Excellency will 
see by the inclosed letter from their Committee 
of Safety.

I have seen some men that were on board the 
fleet after the destruction of Falmouth. Captain Mowat showed his orders, which were, to burn all 
the seaports east of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. When he departed 
from Falmouth, he told them that he must go to 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and take a recruit of shells, carcasses, &c., 
and then would visit <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. I expect him 
daily, but in case he does not arrive in a few days, 
shall despair of his coming. I must beg your Excellency to give me intelligence of any movement 
of their ships, with any orders you may think proper with respect to my conduct while here. I shall 
give the earliest intelligence of any thing material; 
and remain, with great esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

P. S. I inclose a letter from the eastward, which was inclosed in one to me, signed by one Major Goodwin, of Pownalborough. That infernal crew of 
Tories, who have laughed at the Congress, despised 
the friends of liberty, endeavoured to prevent fortifying this harbour, and strove to hurt the credit of the Continental money, and are yet endeavouring 
it, walk the streets here with impunity, and will, with a sneer, tell the people in the streets, that all our liberty-poles will soon be converted into gallowses. I must entreat your Excellency to give 
some directions, what to do with those persons, as I 
am fully convinced, that if an engagement was to 
happen, they would, with their own hands, set fire 
to the town, expecting a reward from the ministry 
for such hellish service. Some, who have for a long 
time employed themselves in ridiculing and discouraging those, who were endeavouring to save the 
town, have now turned upon me, and are flying 
from one street to another, proclaiming that you 
gave me no authority to take the ships to secure 
the entrance of the harbour, or did any thing more 
than send me here, to see the town reduced to 
ashes, if our enemies thought proper. Sir, I shall 
wait your directions respecting these villains, and 
see that they are strictly complied with.
