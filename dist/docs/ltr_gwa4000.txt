Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been a little surprised, that the several important 
pieces of intelligence lately received from Europe (such 
parts of it. I mean, as are circulated without reserve in conversation), have not been given to the public in a manner 
calculated to attract the attention and impress the minds of 
the people. As they are now propagated, they run through 
the country in a variety of forms, are confounded in the 
common mass of general rumours, and lose a real part of 
their effect. It would certainly be attended with many 
valuable consequences if they could be given to the people 
in some more authentic and pointed manner. It would 
assist the measures taken to restore our currency, promote 
the recruiting of the army and our other military arrangements, and give a certain spring to our affairs in general. 
</p><p>
Congress may have particular reasons for not communicating the intelligence officially (which would certainly be 
the best mode if it could be done), but if it cannot, it were 
to be wished that as much as is intended to be commonly 
known could be published in as striking a way, and with as 
great an appearance of authority as may be consistent with 
propriety. 
</p><p>
I have taken the liberty to trouble you with this hint, as 
sometimes things the most obvious escape attention. If 
you agree with me in sentiment, you will easily fall upon 
the most proper mode for answering the purpose. 
With great esteem and regard, I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
