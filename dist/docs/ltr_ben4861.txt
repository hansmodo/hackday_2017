DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
In the Affair of so much Importance to you, wherein you 
ask my Advice, I cannot for want of sufficient Premises, 
advise you what to determine, but if you please I will tell you 
how. When those difficult Cases occur, they are difficult, 
chiefly because while we have them under Consideration, all 
the Reasons pro and con are not present to the Mind at the 
same time; but sometimes one Set present themselves, and 
at other times another, the first being out of Sight. Hence 
the various Purposes or Inclinations that alternately prevail, 
and the Uncertainty that perplexes us. 
</p><p>
To get over this, my Way is, to divide half a Sheet of Paper 
by a Line into two Columns ; writing over the one Pro, and 
over the other Con. Then during three or four Days Consideration, I put down under the different Heads short Hints 
of the different Motives, that at different Times occur to me, 
for or against the Measure. When I have thus got them all 
together in one View, I endeavour to estimate their respective 
Weights ; and where I find two, one on each side, that seem 
equal, I strike them both out. If I find a Reason pro equal 
to some two Reasons con, I strike out the three. If I judge 
some two Reasons con, equal to some three Reasons pro, 
</p><p>
I strike out the five; and thus proceeding I find at length 
where the Ballance lies ; and if after a Day or two of farther 
Consideration, nothing new that is of Importance occurs on 
either side, I come to a Determination accordingly. And, 
tho' the Weight of Reasons cannot be taken with the Precision 
of Algebraic Quantities, yet, when each is thus considered, 
separately and comparatively, and the whole lies before me, 
I think I can judge better, and am less liable to make a rash 
Step; and in fact I have found great Advantage from this 
kind of Equation, in what may be called Moral or Prudential 
Algebra. 
</p><p>
Wishing sincerely that you may determine for the best, 
I am ever, my dear Friend, yours most affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
