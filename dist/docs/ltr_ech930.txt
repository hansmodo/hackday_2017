Dearest Ellen:--A long, long time has already elapsed since you have heard anything from me, or me from you. When I first started out, I had hoped to
be able to forward you something long ere this, and have written every few weeks in order to be ready should an opportunity offer to forward them. None offering, I could but cast them into the rolling deep. But we are now within a few days' sail of port, and this will be ready to mail immediately on our arrival.
</p><p>
Dear Ellen, you can hardly imagine how anxious I am to hear from you, to know that you are well and happy. Your dear, sweet letter forwarded to me while in Philadelphia has been a source of great comfort and consolation to me. I have read and reread it, again and again. It contains a charm that words fail me to explain. In it I find expressions which I will lay to my heart as dear and sacred things to be pondered oft and remembered forever.
</p><p>
To tell you of all the sweets and bitters of this voyage would require a volume, for we have had a very long and in many respects a tedious voyage of twenty weeks, where twelve should have sufficed.

Although most of the passengers recovered from the seasickness in about two weeks, Clinton and I suffered very much with it nearly two months. At the end of that time I was taken with the fever. It was during this time when suffering almost unto death, that I read your sweet epistle oftenest, and looked upon the likeness and ring you gave me as tokens of love. Dearest, your sweet image was then always present to my view.

During the pleasant moonlight evenings while others were mingling in the mazy dance or making merry over the flowing bowl, I often sat on deck gazing at the silver queen of night, as an object that you might be looking upon at the same time, until the beautiful queen had hid herself beneath the horizon.
</p><p>
Sometimes on a pleasant Sabbath evening, the ladies
would favor us with a hymn, and as I sat listening to these familiar sounds, memory carried me back to what had been our delightful custom on that evening. I could almost fancy that I was again at home wending my way to church with a lovely burthen on my arm.
</p><p>
I wish you to write me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, California, where I expect to arrive about the first of March, or perhaps sooner. First of all, tell me particularly about yourself and how Cad and Prizer are progressing, and everything that has occurred among the girls and beaux.
</p><p>
Of the vows we made before separating, I need not speak further than to assure you I shall never regret them and hope you may never have occasion to regret them either. If you think proper, you can remember me to your family, but this I leave to your own good judgment.
</p>
