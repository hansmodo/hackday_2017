SIR: 
</p><p>
As your regiment may be more usefully employed at present near 
<a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> river, to guard their settlements and prevent the depredations 
of the enemy in that part of the country, than by acting with the continental troops under Col. Pinckney ; you will be pleased to make the 
best disposition of it, for that purpose. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your most humble servant,

J. RUTLEDGE,
