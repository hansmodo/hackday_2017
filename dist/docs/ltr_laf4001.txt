My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
As soon as I found myself once more on the happy shore of America, one of my first inquiries was after you, and 
the means to get to my old friend. The pleasure to see your son was great indeed ; but I regretted the distance, 
engagements, and duties which obliged me to postpone the high gratification to meet you after so long an absence. 
Since that time, I have been paying visits and receiving welcomes, where every sort of enjoyments and sights exceeding my own sanguine expectations, have mingled with 
the feelings of a lively and profound gratitude. 
</p><p>
From you, my dear sir, and in the name of Congress, I was last honoured with a benevolent farewell. Now, I am 
going to Washington city, the constitutional forms having changed, to await the arrival of the members of the 
Houses, and be introduced to each of them, with my thanks for their kind invitation to this our American land. 
</p><p>
Your letter reached me on my way through a part of the States ; I wish I could myself bear the answer, or tell 
you when I can anticipate a visit to you : but waiting longer would not enable me to know it, at least, for some 
time. I therefore beg you to receive the grateful respects of my son, and the expression of most affectionate sentiments from your old revolutionary companion and constant friend,
