MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
MRS. OTIS arrived, with her little rossignol, in good 
health and spirits, the night before last, and brought 
me your favor of 7th December. Why am I not so 
fortunate as to be able to receive my best friend and 
to spend my days with her, whose society is the principal delight of my life ? If I could make twelve 
thousand dollars at a bargain, and several of such 
bargains in a year : but silence. So it is ordained, 
and we must not complain. 
</p><p>
If a suitable season should occur for ploughing, 
our men may plough ; if not, they may leave it till 
spring, I like your plan very well to stock one place 
with young cattle, and to apply to Shaw, if Humphreys and Porter decline to take care of the dairy 
in the other. I am pleased with Dr. Tufts's plan. 
</p><p>
Citizen Genet made me a visit yesterday while I 
was in Senate, and left his card. I shall leave mine 
at his hotel tomorrow, as several of the senators have 
already hastened to return their visits. But we shall 
be in an awkward situation with this minister. I write 
you little concerning public affairs, because you will 
have every thing in print. How a government can 
go on, publishing all their negotiations with foreign 
nations I know not. To me it appears as dangerous 
and pernicious as it is novel ; but, upon this occasion 
it could not, perhaps, have been avoided. You know 
where, I think, was the error in the first concoction. 
But such errors are unavoidable when the people in 
crowds out of doors undertake to receive ambassadors, and to dictate to their supreme executive. 
</p><p>
I know not how it is, but in proportion as danger 
threatens I grow calm. I am very apprehensive that 
a desperate anti-federal party will provoke all Europe 
by their insolence. But my country has, in its wisdom, contrived for me the most insignificant office 
that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived : and as I can do neither good nor 
evil, I must be borne away by others and meet the 
common fate. 
</p><p>
The President has considered the conduct of Genet 
very nearly in the same light with <a href='/results.php?city=columbus' rel='city'>Columbus</a>, and has 
given him a bolt of thunder. We shall see how this 
is supported by the two houses. There are who 
gnash their teeth with rage which they dare not 
own as yet. We shall soon see whether we have any 
government or not in this country. If the President 
has made any mistake at all, it is by too much partiality for the French republicans and in not preserving a neutrality between the parties in France as well 
as among the belligerent powers ; but although he 
stands at present as high in the admiration and confidence of the people as ever he did, I expect he will 
find many bitter and desperate enemies arise in con 
sequence of his just judgment against Genet. Be 
sides that a party spirit will convert white into black 
, and right into wrong, we have, I fear, very corrupt 
individuals in this country, independent of the common spirit of party. The common movements of 
ambition every day disclose to me views and hopes 
and designs that are very diverting, but these I will 
not commit to paper. They make sometimes a very 
pretty farce for amusement after the great tragedy or 
comedy is over. What I write to you must be in sacred confidence and strict discretion. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Washington prays me every time I see her to 
remember her to you very affectionately. 
I am, as ever, your
