DEAR SIR, Since we had the pleasure of Col. Taylor's arrival, I have left in his better hands the trust of keeping you supplied with whatever communications might interest or amuse 
you. As the political scene here is, however, soon to be suspended, I cannot refuse myself the last opportunity I shall have 
before a dispersion of the dramatis persons takes place of enjoying the pleasure I always feel in tendering my respects and 
affection, as well as testifying the high value I set on your correspondence. 
</p><p>
I seize the opportunity in this case with the more avidity, as 
it permits me, at the same time, to tell you how much we have 
been charmed with the successor to Col. R. H. Lee, and to entreat your co-operation with a number of his other friends in 
overcoming his repugnance to his present station. His talents, 
during the fraction of time he has been on the federal theatre, 
have been of such infinite serv.e to the republican cause, and 
such a terror to its adversaries, that his sudden retirement, on 
which he is strongly bent, ought to be regarded as a public calamity, and counterworked by all the means his friends can use. 
We think it essential that he should be prevailed on to prolong 
his stay in the Government at least through the next session, 
which will form a critical epoch in our political History. Much 
will depend on the turn our affairs will then take; and that will 
depend not a little on the character which Virginia, in particular, will exhibit in the National Councils. In this view, it is to 
be desired that her weight of talents in one branch should correspond with her force of numbers in the other. The figure she 
is to make in the latter, with respect to talents, will depend on 
the issue of the approaching elections. We understand, in general, that there will be no scarcity of competitors; but our information is too defective for an accurate conjecture of the result. Your district has been said to abound more than any 
other in candidates. Mr. C., I presume, is most distinguished 
for parliamentary talents and activity, and on that score claims 
a favorable wish, if the course he would be likely to take should 
furnish no objection, of which those most in the knowledge of 
his politics are the best judges. 
</p><p>
You will have discovered from the newspapers that a pretty 
interesting scrutiny has been started into the administration of 
the Treasury Department.* The documents furnished shew 
that there has been, at least, a very blameable irregularity and 
secrecy in some particulars of it, and many appearances which 
at least require explanation. With some, suspicions are carried very far ; others resolve the whole that is wrong into favoritism to the Bank, &c.; whilst the partizans of the Secretary either see nothing amiss, or are willing to ascribe everything that is so to venial, if not laudable motives. 
</p><p>
The January Packet has just arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. Her 
budget is not yet fully opened to the public. The Government 
of England, it is said, remains firm in the saddle, notwithstanding the spurs which Mr. Paine has so vigorously applied to the 
people. Whether a war is to be forced with France is still 
uncertain, though the affirmative is most countenanced by individual opinions. The arms of France continue to maintain their 
reputation. She is threatened with a further trial of them by 
all the efforts that Austria and Prussia, at least, can make. Spain 
is disposed to be neutral, but would fain make the preserv.ion 
of Louis a condition. You will find by the inclosed paper that 
his fate must ere this have been decided by an appeal to the 
judgment of the nation. 
</p><p>
With every sentiment of esteem and attachment, I am, dear 
sir, yours.
