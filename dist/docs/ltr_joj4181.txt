Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your obliging letter of the 30th ult. The 
oration which came with it abounds in just sentiments, 
handsomely expressed. 
</p><p>
The copies of the report, which you had the goodness to 
send, have come to hand. 
</p><p>
Many considerations would make it agreeable to me to 
attend the meeting of the board at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. I have heretofore found and enjoyed excellent society in that city, and 
although I should feel the absence of several worthy persons, who have removed to the " city not made with hands," 
yet others remain whom it would give me pleasure to 
meet. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the inducements I have to make frequent 
visits to New-York, I have not been there for four years 
past. The state of my health, and the regimen it requires, 
not permitting me to be far or long from home. 
</p><p>
It is certainly desirable that those of our fellow-citizens 
who are friendly to foreign missions, should contribute to 
repair the loss of the mission printing-office at Serampore. 
It appears from a late paper that measures for that purpose 
were taking at New- York, and there is reason to hope 
and expect, that the aggregate amount of the collections 
will be considerable. 
</p><p>
The mode of remitting it to India is of some importance. 
To me it appears advisable that all American missionary 
measures should, as far as circumstances may admit, be 
connected with the American Board for Foreign Missions. 
I therefore think, that the money in question should be 
remitted to India accordingly. If we were at peace with 
England, I should prefer having it remitted, by the board, 
to the missionary society there, and through them to India. 
Mutual confidence and good-will between societies instituted 
for the same purpose, and actuated by similar motives of 
benevolence, should be cultivated. 
</p><p>
Having for some days past been less well than usual, I 
find myself constrained to be more concise than I intended 
when I began this letter. 
</p><p>
With sentiments of esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
