Dear Brother : . . . The more I reflect, the more convinced I am that I was wise and prudent in taking the 
exact course I have, and that it would be the height of 
folly to allow any false ambition to allow the use of my 
name for any political office. 
</p><p>
John B. Henderson is my neighbor here, is a delegate 
at large to the Chicago Convention, and will, if need be, 
announce my unalterable purpose. . . . Why should I, 
at sixty -five years of age, with a reasonable provision 
for life, not a dollar of debt, and with the universal 
respect of my neighbors and countrymen, embark in the 
questionable game of politics? The country is in a state 
of absolute peace, and it would be a farce to declare that 
any man should sacrifice himself to a mere party necessity. Surely you do not rate Hayes or Arthur as great 
men, yet each gave the country a good administration. . . . 
</p><p>
If you count yourself out, I will be absolutely neutral, 
and honestly believe we are approaching that epoch in 
our history when King Log is about as good as King 
Stork. Queen Victoria has proven about the best executive a nation has ever had, and we shall be lucky in 
securing a man of moderate ability and reasonable presence. 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately,
