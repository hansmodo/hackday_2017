<p><i>[Biographers Note:To show further his great feeling in thus having to leave the army
with which he had been associated for so long, I give two more letters,
one to his sister, Mrs. Anne Marshall, of Baltimore, the other to his
brother, Captain Sydney Smith Lee, of the United States Navy:]</i>

My Dear Sister:  I am grieved at my inability to see you....  I have
been waiting for a 'more convenient season,' which has brought to many
before me deep and lasting regret.  Now we are in a state of war which
will yield to nothing.  The whole South is in a state of revolution,
into which Virginia, after a long struggle, has been drawn; and though
I recognise no necessity for this state of things, and would have
forborne and pleaded to the end for redress of grievances, real or
supposed, yet in my own person I had to meet the question whether I
should take part against my native State.
</p><p>
With all my devotion to the Union and the feeling of loyalty and duty
of an American citizen, I have not been able to make up my mind to
raise my hand against my relatives, my children, my home.  I have
therefore resigned my commission in the Army, and save in defense of
my native State, with the sincere hope that my poor services may
never be needed, I hope I may never be called on to draw my sword.  I
know you will blame me; but you must think as kindly of me as you can,
and believe that I have endeavoured to do what I thought right.
</p><p>
To show you the feeling and struggle it has cost me, I send you a
copy of my letter of resignation.  I have no time for more.  May God
guard and protect you and yours, and shower upon you everlasting
blessings, is the prayer of your devoted brother,    <a href=http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel rel=me>. E. Lee.</a>
