My dear Mary,
</p><p>
I only heard this morning of your return, I do hope you feel quite rested from yr. journey & that Rose 's cold will soon be better. We have thought and asked of you in your recent sorrow. I had almost written to you, just to show you we were sorry for your grief. You must let me know when you care to have (Page 2) me come and see you, or if there is anything I can do for you. I should be very glad to contribute to your comfort, - comfort in your great sorrow. I know is more than I can give, but at least you know that I can realize it.
</p><p>
For your dear Father, his years and long sickness, must have been a little help to you in giving him up - but it does not make you miss him less sorely. I have not forgotten the note you wrote me eight- (Page 3) teen months ago, perhaps I never acknowledged it, but maybe I could not. I thought it very sweet - I read it several times. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mnc" rel="parent met">Mamma</a> and <<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mil" rel="sibling met">Mildred</a> ask me to send their love & sympathy.
</p><p>
Good-night-,
</p><p>
Very sincerely yours
</p><p>
