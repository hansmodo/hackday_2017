My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving the several 
letters, answers to those which I have had the honor 
of writing to your Excellency. In one of my last, 
I suggested to your Excellency what appeared to me 
to be the temper of our last House of Representatives relative to the new Constitution, and my apprehensions lest the same spirit which they possessed 
would be by them diffused through the different parts 
of the State. Their professed design was to shift the 
Governor, and to appoint one, and a Lieutenant-Governor, of their own sentiments. Hence federalism 
and anti-federalism were pitted one against the other. 
The antifederalists were in hopes of throwing such an 
influence into the Government by a change of its 
officers, as to prevent an organization of the General Government by this State, should it be adopted by nine. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=joh' rel='colleague'>Mr. Hancock</a> was put up by the federalists, and 
Mr. Gerry by the opposite party, for Governor. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague'>Mr. Adams</a> and Mr. Lincoln were put up by the federalists as Lieutenant-Governor, and General Warren by 
the other party. The division of votes between 
Adams and Lincoln, prevented a choice of Lieutenant-Governor by the people. They had about two thirds 
of the votes. General Warren had the greatest part 
of the remainder. As no person was chosen, the four 
gentlemen who had the most votes were, by our Constitution, candidates from whom the House must choose 
two, and send their names to the Senate, one of 
whom must be chosen by them Lieutenant-Governor. 
Adams, Warren, Gerry, and Lincoln, were the candidates. The votes for them by the people stood as 
follows; â€” Warren, six thousand one hundred and fifty-seven; Adams, three thousand four hundred and ninety-five ; Gerry, six hundred and sixty-nine ; Lincoln, 
ten thousand two hundred and four. Warren and Lincoln were returned to the Senate. They elected Lincoln, who had twenty votes out of twenty-eight. He 
accepted the trust. I hope he will discharge the duties of his office with fidelity. 
</p><p>
I have been thus particular in returning the numbers (as the contest, as I said before, seemed to be 
between the federalists and those of a different character), that you might judge of the temper of the 
people, and of the state of the parties. Federalism 
is manifestly fast gaining ground. In our last House 
of Representatives, the antifederalists could carry any 
vote they pleased; and there cannot be a doubt but, 
if it had been with them to determine the question, 
they would instantly have rejected the Constitution 
with triumph. In the present House it has, I am 
confident, a great majority in its favor, much greater 
than it had in the Convention. In this State, the 
people are manifestly returning to that train of thinking and line of duty, necessary, and indeed indispensable, to their well-being. 
</p><p>
Though the majority have much to do, yet they 
must take care that they do not do too much ; the 
utmost good temper and moderation must be used, 
and we must make haste slowly. On the whole, if 
we act with judgment, temper, and moderation, we 
shall, I have no doubt, in a short time, have a Government established, the influences of which will not 
only promote and preserve the happiness and interest of the United States, but the beneficial effects 
of it will be enjoyed by all the different nations of 
the world. 
</p><p>
I wish my most dutiful respects to Mrs. Washington, and that the children may be assured and early 
taught that <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='me'>General Lincoln</a> loves them, and that he 
wishes they may live long, live happily, and be the 
most honored and useful among their brethren. With 
the sincerest esteem, 
I have the honor of being, my dear General, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=bel" rel="me">Benjamin Lincoln</a>.
