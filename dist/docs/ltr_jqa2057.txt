No. 23 [EDMUND RANDOLPH]

THE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=hague" rel="city">Hague</a>, February 1st, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1795">1795</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
A vessel belonging to Mr. Swanwick, bound from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> to Hamburg, was obliged some days since by stress 
of weather to put into the Texel, and an application to the 
representatives of the French people became necessary to 
obtain a permission for the captain to depart and proceed 
upon his voyage. I saw them accordingly this day, and 
they assure me that the necessary orders shall immediately 
be given, requiring only for their justification a demand in 
writing, which I have therefore made. 
</p><p>
They said they were happy to have the ministers of the 
powers in friendship with France as witnesses of the manner 
in which they conducted themselves in this country. I 
answered, that the testimony of every spectator must be 
honorable to them in the highest degree. And certainly 
their conduct has been not merely just but generous. They 
have not only promised and secured respect for the persons, 
property, and opinions of this people, but they have done 
the same towards the individuals even of the other nations 
at war with them. The ministers of Great Britain, Spain, 
Prussia and Sardinia left this place upon the approach of 
the French armies. The Spanish Minister had his horses 
taken from his carriage in the middle of the road, and was 
left thus in the coach on his way through the province of Guclderland. This depredation was committed by soldiers of an allied army. 
</p><p>
But the Portuguese and Russian Ministers, and the 
Secretary of the Prussian Legation, who remained here, 
have not been molested, but have been treated with polite 
ness and attention. The Russian Minister, desiring to 
leave the country, was provided with a passport by the 
representatives of the people. It has been left at the option 
of the others to withdraw or to remain at their pleasure, and 
all the privileges of the diplomatic character are allowed 
them, and have not been violated by any of the troops. . . . 
</p><p>
The inveteracy against Great Britain appears to be unanimous among them, and discovers itself upon every occasion. 
They talk of making a descent in England, as of a thing 
decided on, and most of them are ambitious of being employed in the expedition. Their hopes of success are founded 
upon the expectation that they shall have only to contend 
with such warriors as they have found in the British troops 
upon the continent. They declare universally that these 
troops are the worst of all the allied armies. To all the 
others they render full justice, most especially to the Austrians.
