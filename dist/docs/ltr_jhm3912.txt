SIR: 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 9th inst., enclosing the articles of agreement entered into with Graney and his party, came safe to me on the 13th. I 
took the earliest opportunity of laying them before the Council for 
their consideration, and, after weighing them with that circumspection 
which was due to their interesting contents, they have signified their 
unanimous approbation of the same. They also meet with my most 
hearty concurrence; and permit me, sir, to express to you the high 
sense I entertain of the services you have rendered to the State on this 
important occasion. The measures adopted by you are so well calculated, that they could not fail to produce the favorable issue which has 
attended them; and I think there is every reason to expect that the 
advantages to be derived to the State from so happy a termination of 
this matter, will be still more diffusive than they have yet appeared to 
be, and will, in a short time, work a total extinction of that spirit of 
discord which has so unfortunately pervaded this State for some time 
past. It is necessary I should have the names of the persons who are 
parties to the agreement, as every man's name must be included in the 
proclamation of pardon ; I should, therefore, be glad you would forward 
them to me as soon as you can, and, in the meantime, inform them of 
the reasons for delaying the proclamation, as they might otherwise suspect an intention of avoiding it. I have no particular orders to give, 
but I must earnestly recommend your earliest attention to be paid to 
the militia of this brigade, who are the most incorrigibly obstinate and 
perverse beings that I have ever met with, and who are absolutely a 
disgrace to the State. I am convinced, from repeated experiments I 
have made of them, that nothing but the most rigid execution of the 
militia law with regard to them, can ever bring them to a proper sense 
of their duty. In speaking of the brigade, it is necessary I should 
inform you that the militia of the islands are by no means to be included 
in the censure ; on the contrary, they merit applause ; for, notwithstanding their exposed situation, they early submitted, and, whilst the other 
parts of the brigade were behaving in the most unwarrantable manner, 
they cheerfully submitted to every order given them, and have repeatedly repulsed the attacks of the enemy on the islands, and, as far as I 
have had occasion to employ them, they have done their duty. I have 
this moment received your letter of the 16th inst. Most of its contents 
have already been observed upon. The mode in which you propose to 
treat Major Skelly, I think may be productive of very good consequences. I sent Mr. "Wilson, the sheriff for Cheraws, his commission 
three months ago, and am surprised to find he has not received it. It 
must be lying somewhere at <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> ; but, if he cannot get it, I 
will send him another. However, his not having the commission need 
not prevent him from acting. The appointment by the Legislature is 
the substantial part; the commission is more a matter of form. 
I am, sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
