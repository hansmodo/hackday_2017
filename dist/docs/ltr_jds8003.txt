Sir : I have one hundred marines and two hundred men on shore, well armed, and also two 18-pounder carronades, mounted for field-pieces, and can land the remainder of my force in a 
few minutes, if necessary. By the best information I can obtain, <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague">Fremont</a> was at the Pueblo (of St. Joseph) the day before yesterday, and probably at St. Johns yesterday. I sent a letter to him two days since, by express, and yesterday a message by an American who was on his way to Yerba Buena, who promised to see him ; he has also a message for you ; therefore I am in momentary expectation of hearing from him. <a href="/results.php?tla=jsc" rel="adversary">Castro</a> buried two field-pieces, with their shot, at St. Johns, and is flying before <a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="colleague">Fremont</a>. 
</p><p>
I have information from the Pueblo (of St. Joseph) that yesterday forty foreigners in that town wanted to hoist our flag, but had no bunting. I shall send them some the first opportunity, and shall direct them to organize themselves into a company of cavalry, choose their own officers, for the protection of their own property against marauders and the Indians, and then 
report to me. When organized and reported they will be mustered into service and receive instructions from me 
</p><p>
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jds" rel="me">John D. Sloat</a>,

Commander-in-Chief, etc.
