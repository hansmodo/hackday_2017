<a rel='month origin' value='7'>July</a> <a rel='day origin' value='23'>23d</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va. <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> came in so softly that I did not know she was here until she leaned over me and said : A 
great battle has been fought. <a href='/results.php?tla=jpj' rel=''>Joe Johnston</a> led the right wing, and <a href='/results.php?tla=pgb' rel='met'>Beauregard</a> the left wing of the army. Your 
husband is all right. Wade Hampton is wounded. Colonel Johnston of the Legion killed; so are Colonel Bee 
and Colonel Bartow. Kirby Smith is wounded or killed." 
</p><p>
I had no breath to speak ; she went on in that desperate, calm way, to which people betake themselves under the 
greatest excitement: " Bartow, rallying his men, leading them into the hottest of the fight, died gallantly at the head 
of his regiment. The President telegraphs me only that it is a great victory. General Cooper has all the other telegrams. 
</p><p>
Still I said nothing ; I was stunned ; then I was so grateful. Those nearest and dearest to me were safe still. She 
then began, in the same concentrated voice, to read from a paper she held in her hand : Dead and dying cover the 
field. Sherman's battery taken. Lynchburg regiment cut to pieces. Three hundred of the Legion wounded." 
</p><p>
That got me up. Times were too wild with excitement to stay in bed. We went into Mrs. Preston's room, and she 
made me lie down on her bed. Men, women, and children 
streamed in. Every living soul had a story to tell. complete victory," you heard everywhere. We had been such 
anxious wretches. The revulsion of feeling was almost too 
much to bear. 
</p><p>
To-day I met my friend, <a href='/results.php?tla=rmh' rel='friend met'>Mr. Hunter</a>. I was on my way to Mrs. Bartow's room and begged him to call at some 
other time. I was too tearful just then for a morning visit from even the most sympathetic person. 
</p><p>
A woman from Mrs. Bartow's country was in a fury because they had stopped her as she rushed to be the first 
to tell Mrs. Bartow her husband was killed, it having been decided that <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> should tell her. Poor thing ! She 
was found lying on her bed when <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> knocked. 
"Come in, she said. When she saw it was <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a>, she sat up, ready to spring to her feet, but then there was some 
thing in <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis's</a> pale face that took the life out of her. She stared at <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a>, then sank back, and covered her 
face as she asked: " Is it bad news for me? " <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> did not speak. " Is he killed? " Afterward Mrs. Bartow 
said to me : " As soon as I saw <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis's</a> face I could not say one word. I knew it all in an instant. I knew it be 
fore I wrapped the shawl about my head.

Maria, Mrs. Preston's maid, furiously patriotic, came into my room. " These colored people say it is printed in 
the papers here that the Virginia people done it all. Now Mars Wade had so many of his men killed and he 
wounded, it stands to reason that South Carolina was no ways backward. If there was ever anything plain, that's plain." 
</p><p>
Tuesday. Witnessed for the first time a military funeral. As that march came wailing up, they say Mrs. Partow fainted. The empty saddle and the led war-horse we saw and heard it all, and now it seems we are never out 
of the sound of the Dead March in Saul. It comes and it comes, until I feel inclined to close my ears and scream.

Yesterday, Mrs. Singleton and ourselves sat on a bed side and mingled our tears for those noble spirits John 
Darby, Theodore Barker, and James Lowndes. To-day we find we wasted our grief ; they are not so much as wounded. 
I dare say all the rest is true about them in the face of the enemy, with flags in their hands, leading their men. But 
Dr. Darby is a surgeon. " He is as likely to forget that as I am. He is grandson of Colonel Thomson of the Revolution, 
called, by way of pet name, by his soldiers, " Old Danger/ Thank Heaven they are all quite alive. And we will not 
cry next time until officially notified.
