HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI. 
</p><p>
IN THE FIELD, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=savannah" rel="city">Savannah</a>, GA. , Jan. 8, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1865">1865</a>.

Special Field Orders No. 6.

The General commanding announces to the troops composing the Military Division of the Mississippi, that he 
has received from the President of the United States and 
from Lieutenant <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a>, letters conveying their 
high sense and appreciation of the campaign just closed 
resulting in the capture of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=savannah" rel="city">Savannah</a> and the defeat of 
Hood's army in Tennessee. 
</p><p>
In order that all may understand the importance of 
events it is proper to revert to the situation of affairs in 
September last. We held <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=atlanta" rel="city">Atlanta</a>, a city of little value 
to us, but so important to the enemy that Mr. Davis, the 
head of the rebellious faction in the South, visited his 
army near Palmetto, and commanded it to regain it, as 
well as to ruin and destroy us by a series of measures 
which he thought would be effectual. That army, by a 
rapid march, gained our railroad near Big Shanty, and 
afterwards about Dalton. We pursued it, but it moved 
so rapidly that we could not overtake it, and General 
Hood led his army successfully far over towards Mississippi in hopes to decoy us out of Georgia. But we were 
not thus to be led away by him, and preferred to lead 
and control events ourselves. Generals Thomas and Schofield, commanding departments to our rear, returned to 
their posts and prepared to decoy General Hood into their 
meshes, whilst we came on to complete the original joureey. We quietly and deliberately destroyed <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=atlanta" rel="city">Atlanta</a> and 
all the railroads which the enemy /'had used to carry on 
war against us, occupied the state capitol and then captured his commercial capital, which had been so strongly 
fortified from the sea as to defy approach from that 
quarter. 
</p><p>
Almost at the moment of our victorious entry into 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=savannah" rel="city">Savannah</a>, came the welcome and expected news that our 
comrades in Tennessee had also fulfilled nobly and well 
their part, had decoyed General Hood to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, and 
then turned on him, defeating his army thoroughly, capturing nearly all his artillery, great numbers of prisoners, 
and were still pursuing the fugitives down into Alabama. 
So complete a success in military operations extending 
over a half a continent is an achievement that entitles it 
to a place in the military history of the world. The 
armies serving in Georgia and Tennessee, as well as the 
local garrisons of Decatur, Bridgeport, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=chattanooga" rel="city">Chattanooga</a>, and 
Murfreesboro, are alike entitled to the common honors, 
and each regiment may inscribe on its colors at pleasure 
the words " <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=savannah" rel="city">Savannah</a> " or " <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>." 
</p><p>
The General-in-Chief embraces in the same general 
success the operations of the cavalry column under Generals Stoneraan, Burbridge, and Gillem, that penetrated 
into southwest Virginia and paralyzed the efforts of the 
enemy to disturb the peace and safety of east Tennessee. 
Instead of being put on the defensive, we have at all 
points assumed the bold offensive, and completely 
thwarted the designs of the enemies of our country. 
By Order of Major General,
