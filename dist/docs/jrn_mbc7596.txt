<a rel='month origin' value='8'>August</a> <a rel='day origin' value='27'>27th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city origin'>RICHMOND</a>, Va., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. Theodore Barker and James Lowndes 
came ; the latter has been wretchedly treated. A man said, 
" All that I wish on earth is to be at peace and on my own 
plantation," to which Mr. Lowndes replied quietly, " I wish I had a plantation to be on, but just now I can't see 
how any one would feel justified in leaving the army. " Mr. Barker was bitter against the spirit of braggadocio so ram 
pant among us. The gentleman who had been answered so 
completely by James Lowndes said, with spitefulness : 
" Those women who are so frantic for their husbands to 
join the army would like them killed, no doubt. "

Things were growing rather uncomfortable, but an interruption came in the shape of a card. An old classmate 
of Mr. Chesnut's Captain Archer, just now fresh from California followed his card so quickly that Mr. Chesnut 
had hardly time to tell us that in Princeton College they called him " Sally " Archer he was so pretty when he entered. He is good-looking still, but the service and consequent rough life have destroyed all softness and girlishness. He will never be so pretty again.

The North is consolidated ; they move as one man, with no States, but an army organized by the central power. 
Russell in the Northern camp is cursed of Yankees for that Bull Run letter. Russell, in his capacity of Englishman, 
despises both sides. He divides us equally into North and South. He prefers to attribute our victory at Bull Run to 
Yankee cowardice rather than to Southern courage. He gives no credit to either side; for good qualities, we are 
after all mere Americans ! Everything not national is arrested. It looks like the business of <a href='/results.php?tla=wls' rel=''>Seward</a>.

I do not know when I have seen a woman without knitting in her hand. Socks for the soldiers is the cry. One poor man said he had dozens of socks and but one shirt. He preferred more shirts and fewer stockings. We make 
a quaint appearance with this twinkling of needles and the everlasting sock dangling below.

They have arrested Wm. B. Reed and Miss Winder, she boldly proclaiming herself a secessionist. Why should she 
seek a martyr's crown? Writing people love notoriety. It is so delightful to be of enough consequence to be arrested. 
</p><p>
I have often wondered if such incense was ever offered as Napoleon's so-called persecution and alleged jealousy of Madame de Stael.

Russell once more, to whom London, Paris, and India have been an every-day sight, and every-night, too, streets 
and all. How absurd for him to go on in indignation be cause there have been women on negro plantations who 
were not vestal virgins. Negro women get married, and after marriage behave as well as other people. Marrying is 
the amusement of their lives. They take life easily ; so do their class everywhere. Bad men are hated here as else where. 
</p><p>
" I hate slavery. I hate a man who You say there are no more fallen women on a plantation than in London 
in proportion to numbers. But what do you say to this to a magnate who runs a hideous black harem, with its 
consequences, under the same roof with his lovely white wife and his beautiful and accomplished daughters? He 
holds his head high and poses as the model of all human virtues to these poor women whom God and the laws have 
given him. From the height of his awful majesty he scolds and thunders at them as if he never did wrong in his life. 
Fancy such a man finding his daughter reading Don Juan. You with that immoral book! he would say, 
and then he would order her out of his sight. You see Mrs. Stowe did not hit the sorest spot. She makes Legree a 
bachelor." " Remember George II. and his likes." 
</p><p>
"Oh, I know half a Legree a man said to be as cruel as Legree, but the other half of him did not correspond. He 
was a man of polished manners, and the best husband and father and member of the church in the world." " Can 
that be so? " 
</p><p>
1Yes, I know it. Exceptional case, that sort of thing, always. And I knew the dissolute half of Legree well. He 
was high and mighty, but the kindest creature to his slaves. And the unfortunate results of his bad ways were not sold, 
had not to jump over ice-blocks. They were kept in full view, and provided for handsomely in his will." 
</p><p>
" The wife and daughters in the might of their purity and innocence are supposed never to dream of what is as 
plain before their eyes as the sunlight, and they play their parts of unsuspecting angels to the letter. They profess to 
adore the father as the model of all saintly goodness." 
</p><p>
" Well, yes ; if he is rich he is the fountain from whence all blessings flow." 
</p><p>
" The one I have in my eye my half of Legree, the dissolute half was so furious in temper and thundered his 
wrath so at the poor women, they were glad to let him do as he pleased in peace if they could only escape his 
everlasting fault-finding, and noisy bluster, making every body so uncomfortable." " Now now, do you know any 
woman of this generation who would stand that sort of thing? No, never, not for one moment. The make-believe 
angels were of the last century. We know, and we won't have it." 
</p><p>
" The condition of women is improving, it seems." " Women are brought up not to judge their fathers or 
their husbands. They take them as the Lord provides and are thankful." 
</p><p>
" If they should not go to heaven after all ; think what lives most women lead. " No heaven, no purgatory, no 
the other thing? Never. I believe in future rewards and punishments. 
</p><p>
How about the wives of drunkards ? I heard a woman say once to a friend of her husband, tell it as a cruel matter 
of fact, without bitterness, without comment, Oh, you have not seen him ! He has changed. He has not gone to 
bed sober in thirty years. She has had her purgatory, if not the other thing, here in this world. We all know 
what a drunken man is. To think, for no crime, a person may be condemned to live with one thirty years. " You 
wander from the question I asked. Are Southern men worse because of the slave system and the facile black 
women? " " Not a bit. They see too much of them. The barroom people don't drink, the confectionery people loathe 
candy. They are sick of the black sight of them. " 
</p><p>
" You think a nice man from the South is the nicest thing in the world ? " "I know it. Put him by any other man and see! " 
</p><p>
Have seen Yankee letters taken at Manassas. The spelling is often atrocious, and we thought they had all gone 
through a course of blue-covered Noah Webster spellingbooks. Our soldiers do spell astonishingly. There is Horace Greeley: they say he can't read his own handwriting. But he is candid enough and disregards all time-serving. He 
says in his paper that in our army the North has a hard nut to crack, and that the rank and file of our army is 
superior in education and general intelligence to theirs.

My wildest imagination will not picture Mr. Mason as a diplomat. He will say chaw for chew, and he will call 
himself Jeems, and he will wear a dress coat to breakfast. Over here, whatever a Mason does is right in his own eyes. 
He is above law. Somebody asked him how he pronounced his wife's maiden name: she was a Miss Chew from Philadelphia. 
</p><p>
They say the English will like Mr. Mason; he is so manly, so straightforward, so truthful and bold. " A fine 
old English gentleman," so said Russell to me, " but for tobacco." " I like Mr. Mason and <a href='/results.php?tla=rmh' rel='acquaintance met'>Mr. Hunter</a> better than 
anybody else." " And yet they are wonderfully unlike." " Now you just listen to me," said I. "Is <a href='/results.php?tla=vad' rel='acquaintance met'>Mrs. Davis</a> in 
hearing no? Well, this sending Mr. Mason to London is the maddest thing yet. Worse in some points of view than 
Yancey, and that was a catastrophe."
