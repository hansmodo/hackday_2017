TO BENJAMIN GRATZ
</p><p>
I thank you My beloved Brother for your kind and sympathizing letter received this day. It was indeed a severe and 
unexpected bereavement that took my much loved friend and companion from me- In all her illness Julia never considered her life in danger nor did the Dr or ourselves fear 
such a fatal result of her painful disease- but it was God's will, to take her from "the evil to come" and she resigned her 
spirit with the most tranquil submission into His hands- but oh My dear Brother the loss of her society is to me, a trial 
only to be borne by the conviction that her whole life was a preparation for a happy futurity, and her death the death 
of the righteous- her love and care of me could only be appreciated by those who witnessed it, and was continued to 
the last hour, but I will not pain you by dwelling on my grief. I thank you my Dear Ben for the sympathy you express- and the true character you have drawn of our friend- 
</p><p>
My dear Brother, at my advanced age it is not to be expected that I should possess as much vigor as in times gone 
by. But I am quite as strong as when you last saw me and still hope that I may have the happiness of embracing you 
again, when the war & rumors of war will leave you free to meet us again- God bless you my precious Brother, and grant health and happiness to you all 
</p><p>
Your affectionate
