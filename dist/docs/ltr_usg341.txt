DEAR SISTER:
</p><p>
I have been intending to write you for some time; but the moment I get
into my office in the morning it is overwhelmed with visitors, and
continues so throughout the day. I now write of a rainy evening, after
having read the New York papers.--Jennie is with us, has been for some
days. Mr. Corbin also has been with us for a few days but left to-day.
Jennie will remain until she becomes homesick which I hope will not be
soon.
</p><p>
I received your letter in which you gave me an extract from Mr.
Wolff's. I had no recollection or knowledge of the matter whatever. The
fact is I am followed wherever I go,--at Long Branch as well as here. I
sometimes shake off callers, not knowing their business, whom I would
be delighted to see. In the case of Mr. Wolff, however, I do not think
that I ever knew that he had called. For the first time in my life I
had arranged to go fishing at sea. To do so it was necessary to engage
fishermen, with boat, beforehand. General Porter did not know that I
had made the arrangement, and probably was not at my house when I
returned from riding the evening after Mr. W. called. You will see the
explanation. I will write it to Mr. Wolff.

Fred. after graduating at West Point accepted a position as assistant
civil engineer, and gave up a good portion of his furlough to go to
work at his new profession. He has been in the Rocky Mountains since
August surveying, in pursuit of his new profession, but with leave of
absence as an army officer. But little or nothing can be done in the
winter by him, and I have therefore got him a leave of absence from his
engineer duties to accompany <a href="/results.php?tla=wts" rel="co-worker met">General Sherman</a> abroad, until the latter
part of April. I expect him to sail about the middle of next month.
<a href="/results.php?tla=wts" rel="co-worker met">General Sherman</a> goes on the flag-ship of the European Squadron which
will land at some of the Atlantic ports, then proceed to the
Mediterranean touching at points during the early winter on both sides
of the sea, and in the spring, probably in time to attend the Carnival
in Rome, will leave the ship and work across the Continent, in time to
be home at the time I have indicated. I will instruct Fred. to run up
to Copenhagen from a convenient point and spend a few days with you.
You will find him a well-grown and much improved boy. He is about the
height brother Simpson was and well developed physically. You will be
pleased with him I know.
</p><p>
During the Harvard vacation, next year, I intend that Buck and Jesse
shall go to Europe also. It may be that in the short time they will
have to remain abroad they may not be able to get up to see you, but I
know they will be pleased to do so, and may spare time for that
purpose.
</p><p>
I do not know but that I owe Mr. Cramer an apology for not answering
his letters. All have been received and I have been gratified with
them. But besides being a little negligent I am so constantly pressed
that it is almost impossible for me to get any time to devote to
private correspondence.
</p><p>
All send our kindest regards to Mr. Cramer, and love to you and the
children.
</p><p>
Yours affectionately,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.

<p>
P.S. I shall always be delighted to receive letters from you and Mr.
Cramer whether I answer them or not.
</p>
