Dear Commodore : I have received yours of this date, repeating, as you say, what you stated to me yesterday, and in reply I have only to remark that, if I had so understood you, I 
certainly would not have written my letter to you of last evening. 
</p><p>
You certainly could not for a moment suppose that I would advise or suggest to you any movement which might endanger the safety of the garrison and the ships in the harbor. 
</p><p>
My letter of yesterday's date stated that "if you can take from here," etc., of which you were the judge, and of which I knew nothing. 
</p><p>
Yours truly, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=swk" rel="me">S. W. Kearny</a>, Brigadier-General.

Commodore R. F. Stockton, 
</p><p>
Commanding United States Navy, etc., San Diego.
