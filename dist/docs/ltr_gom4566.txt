Sir, 
</p><p>
Just about to leave this city, I have been detained for some 
hours by an object, which appears to me important. I have 
already had occasion to mention the impress of American seamen, to serve on board of British ships of war. The ministers 
seemed desirous of doing what was right, and of avoiding just 
ground of complaint) but the orders for an impress being of 
necessity entrusted to agents, neither scrupulous nor delicate, it 
becomes as barbarous in the execution, as in the principle it is 
violent and despotic. Allowances are to be made in judging 
such cases, but I had been given to understand &gt; that the principles adopted by the administration were such as ought not 
by us to be admitted. 
</p><p>
I must own to you, Sir, that my position was, in this respect, 
disagreeable. I did not wish to assume the management of af 
fairs not committed to me, nor put on the appearance of a 
character, to which I had no pretension ; and yet, I could not 
be an indifferent witness to the injuries sustained by my fellow 
citizens. Liable to censure for neglect, and to the imputation 
of hunting employment, but feeling alike guiltless of the one, 
and incapable of the other, I determined neither to seek for 
causes of complaint, nor yet to avoid them, but submit my con 
duct to the dictate of occasion. Pardon me, Sir, for making 
myself my subject. To you an explanation of actions and mo 
tives is due. And as for the world, T shall never take pains to 
conceal the one, nor communicate the other. 
</p><p>
On the seventeenth instant, Mr Cutting called to mention the 
case of an American, who had been impressed, and, after an 
order obtained for his release, had been ill used, confined, and 
was then in fetters, expecting severe and ignominious punishment. I immediately went to Whitehall, and waited some time 
for the Duke of Leeds, or Mr Burgess, to arrive. Mr Burgess 
at length came ; and upon my showing him the papers, and ex 
plaining the business, he immediately took measures to procure 
the needful redress. He expressed, at the same time, in very 
proper terms, the regret he felt for such abuses of authority, 
Next morning, Captain Makins applied to me, (as being acquainted with the owners of his ship,) to assist in procuring the 
release of his mate and seamen. He told me, that previous 
to his leaving New York, a part of his crew had made oath that they were citizens of America. Arrived at the mouth of 
the channel, he was stopped by a British frigate, which took 
away some of them, but at length returned all except one, who 
was an Irishman. After this, he passed several vessels of war, 
without receiving either insult or molestation ; but in the river, 
so many of his men were taken out, that he was obliged to hire 
others, for the security of his ship. Some of the men so taken were induced to enter into the British service, as he 
informed me, by ill usage, threats, and particularly by the assurance, that having nobody here to speak for them, their case 
was desperate, and therefore they might as well take the bounty as let it alone, for go they must. 
</p><p>
Many aggravating circumstances were related ; but as these 
are generally foreign to the merits of a question, I desired him 
to write me a letter, simply stating the facts. Among these, 
were a refusal to deliver the men who had entered, a rejection 
of all evidence other than his oath, and .the insisting that this 
evidence should prove the men to have been born in America. 
I immediately transmitted that letter, with the papers accompanying it, to Mr Burgess, who sent them to Mr Stephens, the 
Secretary of the Admiralty. Yesterday, Captain Makins called 
again, complaining that he could get no satisfaction from the 
admiralty board, nor from the regulating captain ; but on the 
contrary was treated by the latter with insult. I immediately 
wrote a note to Mr Burgess, who assigned the death of Mr Stephens son in a duel, as the cause why the affair had been 
neglected ; and gave me the assurance, that he would pay every 
attention to it. An event so distressing would certainly call 
from all other cares the mind of a father. I could not, there 
fore, insist on the decisive answer which I wished. But having been repeatedly told, that the practice was such as is above 
mentioned, I wrote to the Duke of Leeds the letter, of which 
the enclosed is a copy. You will perceive, Sir, that I have 
sought rather to bring forward the particular objects for consideration, than to dilate those observations to which they give 
rise. I will not trouble you with any comment on this transaction, but only entreat that you will excuse my interference. 
Having acted without authority, there is at least this advantage 
to the public, that my conduct may be avowed or disavowed, 
as circumstances shall render most proper. I am, &c.
