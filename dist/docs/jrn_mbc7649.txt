<a rel='month origin' value='6'>June</a> <a rel='day origin' value='24'>24th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. Mr. Chesnut, having missed the Secessionville fight by half a day, was determined to see the one 
around Richmond. He went off with General Cooper and Wade Hampton. Blanton Duncan sent them for a lunch 
eon on board the cars, ice, wine, and every manner of good thing.

In all this death and destruction, the women are the same chatter, patter, clatter. " Oh, the Charleston refugees are so full of airs; there is no sympathy for them here!" " Oh, indeed! That is queer. They are not half 
as exclusive as these Hamptons and Prestons. The airs these people do give themselves." " Airs, airs," laughed Mrs. Bartow, parodying Tennyson's Charge of the Light Brigade. " Airs to the right of them, Airs to the left of 
them, some one had blundered." " Volleyed and thundered rhymes but is out of place.

The worst of all airs came from a democratic landlady, who was asked by Mrs. <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>President Davis</a> to have a carpet 
shaken, and shook herself with rage as she answered, "You know, madam, you need not stay here if my carpet or any 
thing else does not suit you."

John Chesnut gives us a spirited account of their ride around McQlellan. I sent the letter to his grandfather. 
The women ran out screaming with joyful welcome as soon as they caught sight of our soldiers gray uniforms ; ran to 
them bringing handfuls and armfuls of food. One gray-headed man, after preparing a hasty meal for them, knelt 
and prayed as the}^ snatched it, as you may say. They were in the saddle from Friday until Sunday. They were used 
up; so were their horses. Johnny writes for clothes and more horses. Miss S. C. says: " No need to send any more 
of his fine horses to be killed or captured by the Yankees ; wait and see how the siege of Richmond ends. The horses 
will go all the same, as Johnny wants them.
