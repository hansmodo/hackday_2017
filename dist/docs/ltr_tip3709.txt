Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been favored with your Excellency's letter 
of the 15th instant, which would have been acknowledged by the subsequent post, had I not been made 
to expect a small supply of money the same week, 
by the bearer of which I meant to write to your 
Excellency. But in this expectation also I was disappointed. My long continuance here has distressed 
me exceedingly, but it appeared to me that the service would be promoted by it. I had, from time to 
time, sent orders to Colonel Hughes to prepare every 
thing that was to be provided in his department for 
the ensuing campaign, and to the Commissary of Forage to procure his supplies, assuring them, agreeably 
to the encouragement I had myself received, that I 
would furnish them with money to fulfil their engagements, every necessary estimate for these purposes 
having been laid before the Superintendent of Finance, 
and the necessity of the supplies admitted. 
</p><p>
These services being undertaken in full confidence 
that I should bring with me the requisite sums 
of money, I did not dare to return without them. 
While the Financier held up to my view the prospect of supplies, I presented the same to Colonel 
Hughes and at my own office, and thereby kept alive 
the hopes of the public creditors, who, had I returned 
moneyless, would have been reduced to absolute despair, and all business and supplies have ceased. But 
I am now more unhappy than ever ; for I cannot 
continue to mention even a prospect of fulfilling my 
engagements. Until I was led to expect supplies of 
money to carry on the business of the department, I 
cautiously avoided making any positive engagements, 
thinking the public creditors had been too long abused by faithless promises to admit of any further deception to the public advantage; and the making of 
promises, without a well-grounded prospect of fulfilling them, being totally opposed to my disposition. 
</p><p>
I have at last reduced my immediate demand of 
money "not to the articles necessary and lest to be 
provided now, but to those, for which unless money 
can be furnished, the credit of the department will 
be irretrievably lost." But I can obtain nothing at 
present. The principal causes of this disappointment 
your Excellency is probably informed of The same 
causes prevent the completing the purchases of oxteams. The sum I received for those purchases was 
in <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris's</a> notes, and amounted only to about 
three fifths of the sum requisite for that service -, and 
whether any purchases could be made with them at 
the eastward, was a matter of uncertainty, from which 
no information from my deputies there has relieved 
me. But, if they have succeeded, it is in such a way 
as forbids the Financier giving me any more of them ; 
for these notes are not received there as cash, but 
only as pledges, which are bought up by speculators, 
who make a run upon the funds assigned for their 
redemption. 
</p><p>
My stay here goads me with perpetual anxiety. 
To return empty, would be mortifying in the highest 
degree, and expose me to infinite vexation. To ask a credit of anybody, after The deceptions with which 
I shall be charged, and before the engagements already made are fulfilled, would be deemed a piece of 
effrontery, and nothing could be obtained without recurring to the odious and expensive mode of impress. 
Thus embarrassed and distressed, I have represented 
my situation to the Secretary at War, who will thereon have some communications with the Superintendent of Finance; and by their opinion or your Excellency's orders I shall be governed. I have the honor 
to be, with the greatest respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,
