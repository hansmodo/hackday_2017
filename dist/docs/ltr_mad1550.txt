HON'D SlR- *****

Paper money was the subject of discussion this day, and was 
voted, by a majority of 84 against 17, to be "unjust, impolitic, 
destructive of public and private confidence, and of that virtue 
which is the basis of Republican Government." Our Revenue 
matters have also been on the anvil; several changes in our 
taxes are proposed, and it is not unlikely that some will take 
place. Duties on imports will be urged, as far as they can be 
guarded against smuggling by land, as well as by water. Governor Henry declines a reappointment, but does not come into 
the Assembly. The Attorney or R. H. Lee, probably the former, will supply his place.

We learn that great commotions are prevailing in Massachusetts. An appeal to the Sword is exceedingly dreaded. 
The discontented, it is said, are as numerous as the friends of 
Government, and more decided in their measures. Should they 
get uppermost, it is uncertain what may be the effect. They 
profess to aim only at a reform of their Constitution, and of 
certain abuses in the public administration; but an abolition of 
debts, public and private, and a new division of property, are 
strongly suspected to be in contemplation. 
</p><p>
We also learn that a general combination of the Indians 
threatens the frontier of the United States. Congress are 
planning measures for warding off the blow, one of which is 
an augmentation of the federal troops to upwards of 2,000 men. 
In addition to these ills, it is pretty certain that a formidable 
party in Congress are bent on surrendering the Mississippi to 
Spain, for the sake of some commercial stipulations. The project has already excited much heat within that Assembly, and, 
if pursued, will not fail to alienate the Western Country and 
confirm the animosity and jealousy already subsisting between 
the Atlantic States. I fear that, although it should be frustrated, the effects already produced will be a great bar to our 
amendment of the Confederacy, which I consider as essential to 
its continuance. I havefrom Kentucky which inform 
me that the expedition against the Indians has prevented the 
meeting which was to decide the question of their Independence. It is probable the news relative to the surrender of the 
Mississippi will lessen the disposition to separate.

If the bacon left behind by John should not have been sent, 
it need not be sent at all. Fresh butter will, from time to time, 
continue to be very acceptable. My best regards to my mother 
and the family.

Your affectionate and dutiful son.
