SIR: 
</p><p>
As a magistrate I yesterday presented myself at your door to have 
the honor of paying my respects to your Excellency, and in the after 
noon 1 attended there again, in order to beg to be honored with your 
commands in a military way; for I think that, at this time, while I 
have no occasion to wear my gown, I ought to wear a sword. 
</p><p>
In a word, the favor I have to ask of your Excellency is, that you 
will be pleased to enable me, as a volunteer, to be active in the defence 
of my country. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, sir, your Excellency's most obedient and 
Most humble servant, 
</p><p>
