MY DEAR PORTIA, 
</p><p>
I WISH you to write me by every opportunity to this 
place as well as to France. It seems as if I never 
should get any more letters from America. I have 
sent you some things by Captain Davis, but he has no 
arms and I fear they will be lost by capture. I sent 
things by the Alliance.

The country where I am is the greatest curiosity in 
the world. This nation is not known any where, not 
even by its neighbors. The Dutch language is 
spoken by none but themselves. Therefore they 
converse with nobody, and nobody converses with 
them. The English are a great nation, and they despise the Dutch because they are smaller. The 
French are a greater nation still, and therefore they 
despise the Dutch because they are still smaller in 
comparison to them. But I doubt much whether there 
is any nation of Europe more estimable than the 
Dutch in proportion. Their industry and economy 
ought to be examples to the world. They have less 
ambition, I mean that of conquest and military glory, 
than their neighbors, but I don t perceive that they 
have more avarice. And they carry learning and 
arts, I think, to greater extent. The collections of 
curiosities, public and private, are innumerable. 
I am told that Mr. Searle is arrived at Brest ; but I 
have learned nothing from him as yet, nor do I know 
his destination. The French and Spanish fleets have 
made a sweep of sixty upon the English East India 
and West India fleets. This must have great effects. 
We are all well. Don t expect peace. The English have not yet forgotten the acquisition of Charles 
ton, for which they are making the most childish exultations. The new parliament will give ministry a 
run. Mark my words, you will have no peace but 
what you give yourselves by destroying, root and 
branch, all the British force in America. The English cannot bear the thought that France should dictate the terms of peace, as they call it. They say 
they must make a dishonorable peace now, a shameful 
peace, a degrading peace. This is worse than death 
to them, and thus they will go on, until they are 
forced to sue for a peace still more shameful and humiliating.
