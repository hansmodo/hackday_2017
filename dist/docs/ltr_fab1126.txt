I learn that you have changed houses. I don't believe I shall feel at home in B. if ever I am allowed to get there, you have all moved about so. I should like to find you all in the old house, the barn and yard and I can't place you anywhere but in the little dining room or at the piano in the nice parlor; but if it suits you I have nothing to say. Some of the old settlers, too, I see are going off and then, however much you may stave off the idea, I expect you are growing old. I know that women,
especially American women, will fade out early and you may as well acknowledge the corn that the 'hey day of youth' with you is passed, lamentable fact. I shall not be at all surprised to find you wrinkled, the elasticity in your step gone and your whole tout ensemble decidedly passee. But don't feel grieved at it. I shan't laugh at you. I shall regard you with a kind of reverence, as I used to Mrs. Doctor Moulton, bless her old soul. Now, I have hardly attained my growth. The life I have led for the last three years, far removed from all those dissipations and vices which in civilized countries make such havoc on the constitution of a young man, has tended to develope all my physical energies and I am always healthy and sound every way. If we should be permitted to meet each other in the course of a year or two (which I fervently hope we may) the contrast between the two children will indeed be great.

I have been here since I wrote you, in the old business again: farming, raising chickens, riding wild mules, sowing onions and doing the agreeable to the customers at the Hermitage Hotel, which being strictly interpreted means carving and waiting on the table, making port wine sangarees and milk punches for the ladies who ride out from Marysville and invariably get thirsty, and gassing with travellers generally.

This is truly a beautiful country about here and the climate delightful. No snow, no frost even. Grain all up and vegetables ditto. If it was only settled by good families with a smart sprinkling of young ladies, it would be a Paradise. But unfortunately it is cursed with the most degraded set of Irish squatters, Pike Co. Missourians and mean Yankees that it has ever been my lot to live among in California. We have no society outside of our own house but Lindly's family and in Marysville. We have to corral our stock nights, to prevent its being
stolen and in addition to our kind neighbors we have 'the poor Indian,' whose untutored mine 'can't see God anywhere' (as Pope says), occasionally making a descent from his mountain home and cleaning out all the clothes-lines and spare articles lying around loose. The magpies and coons eat up all the lettuce and cabbage plants and the squatters have squat on all Cole's land but 160 acres, it being a part of the religion of the Western people that no man has a right to any more of this earth's surface than that amount. So you see there are some drawbacks to this fine soil and climate.

Last night the aristocracy of Marysville had a Grand Ball at the U.S. Hotel. I have not heard the particulars but suppose it was a grand affair as people throw themselves on such occasions here. Perhaps you will think it strange that I do not mix in these brilliant assemblies. Well, in the first place I 'hain't got no clothes' and I don't think the fun equal to the expense. I had a very pressing invite to go to a Ball at Parkhurst & Arnold's Ranch on the Sacramento River. Parkhurst promised me some fine sport as he had nine Pike Co. girls engaged; but this was too far (30 miles). The only dancing I have indulged in was at a fandango at the Sonorian Camp, three miles from here. It is a regular Mexican town, some 3000 people and about 40 houses and a number of Mexican families engaged in packing mules. They patronise our Rancho and most all know me and I take every opportunity to learn Spanish and can converse pretty well now as it is of great service here.
</p><p>
Well, I heard of the fandango and I went. It was held in a good-sized room with a bar on one side, of course, and crowded with men and women, all smoking. The orchestra consisted of two fiddles and guitars and made pretty good music. The men were dressed in sky-blue velvet pants, open at the sides and rows of buttons, with
white drawers, red sash and a fancy shirt. The Senoritas, with white muslin dresses, stretched so stiffly that you could not get very near, and silk stockings, looked very pretty. We had cottilions and waltzes and one Senorita danced a fancy dance and made more noise with her little feet and slippers than I could with thick boots. She told me it was the 'Valse Alleman,' never has been published, I guess. Their cotillions are the same as ours except that the last figure is 'all promenade to the Bar,' where you and your fair partner imbibe.
</p><p>
The Fandango went off well. I was very much amused and came away without being stabbed, which was lucky as such things often happen.

P.S. I have not heard from Sewall since I wrote. Tell Father have nothing of interest to write him. Give my love to Mother. Hope her teeth are as good as mine. Will send Father paper. Not decided whether to stop here or go to mining--it depends on the digging. Downieville is all burnt up. Loss $750,000. Will be built again.
