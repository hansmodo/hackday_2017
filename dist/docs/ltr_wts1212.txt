Dear Brother : 
</p><p>
You will be surprised and maybe alarmed, that I have 
at last agreed to publish in book form my Memoirs of a 
period from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1846">1846</a>-65, in two volumes, prepared at great 
cost of labor and care. 
</p><p>
I have carefully eliminated everything calculated to 
raise controversy, except where sustained by documents 
embraced in the work itself, and then only with minor 
parties. I submitted the manuscript to last summer, and he was emphatic that it ought to be published 
in the interest of history. Bancroft did the same, though 
he never saw the manuscript, and I thought I had best 
show it to but few, as after all the responsibility rests 
on me. . . . 
</p><p>
Affectionately, 
</p><p>
