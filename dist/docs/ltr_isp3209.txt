DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
In my letter of yesterday, I acquainted you of the enemy's 
having possession of Fort Montgomery. Yesterday they proceeded up the river with their ships, galleys, flat-bottomed boats, 
&c., and landed a body at Fort Constitution, took possession of 
that post, and played round "the die raux-dc-f rise a little. I expect every moment to have information that they are advancing 
up. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> is on the west side of the river, with about 
four hundred Continental troops, which I sent him yesterday, and 
is exerting himself in collecting the militia. If they attempt to 
land on that side, he will oppose and annoy them as much as 
possible. If this side should be their object, I shall, with the remainder of the Continental troops and the Connecticut militia 
(which, I am happy to inform you, came in yesterday and the 
day before in great numbers, but, I am sorry to say, they 
already begin to run away), oppose them every way in my 
power. Certain it is, that they mean, at all events, to join <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> without delay. They are on a desperate point; 
and I dare say that their orders are positive to join the Northern 
army, at all risks. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a> commands them in person. 
He has two general officers with him, and, I believe, between 
five and six thousand men. If they should proceed by water, I 
shall do every thing in my power to arrive at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> before 
them. Weighing the chcvaux-de-frise, I do not think is a matter 
of any moment to them. They can take a fair wind, and, with 
their flat-bottomed boats, which all have sails, go to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, or 
Half- Moon, with great expedition, and, I believe, without any 
opposition. Would it not be a matter of great importance to 
send, if you can possibly spare them, a detachment from your army towards <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, or some advantageous ground, to prevent 
them from getting between you and me ? For, if they should 
come on your rear, the situation of your army would be disagreeable. 
</p><p>
The loss of Fort Montgomery has, instead of depressing the 
spirits of the country, animated them. So many forts and strong 
holds have been given up without fighting, that they began to 
despair, and thought that our troops would not face the enemy. 
But now they begin to be convinced of the contrary ; for the few 
brave men, who were in that fort, defended it five hours against 
at least five thousand of the enemy, determined on carrying the 
post. The garrison, in the whole, did not amount to more than 
six hundred. Notwithstanding the great superiority of the enemy, 
our troops never surrendered the fort, but fought, from one re 
doubt to another, after the enemy had got into the fort; and, 
when they could do no more, they fought their way through, and 
most of them made their escape. Colonel Dubois, who had a 
wound with a bayonet in his neck, has mustered nearly two hundred of his men, who were with him in the action, many of 
whom have slight wounds with bayonets and swords, but are in 
high spirits, and, I hope, will effect something clever. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=isp" rel="me">ISRAEL PUTNAM</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. If there are any of the militia in your quarter that yet 
remain at home, pray let them be mustered.
