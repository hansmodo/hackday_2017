MY DEAR MADAM : 
</p><p>
You will perceive by our papers that four members of 
our present delegation in Congress are reflected. It is not from the partly malevolence of a few contemptible 
scribblers in our newspapers that the sense of the people 
is to be collected. Two candidates had been opposed to 
Mr. Ames, with the intention to divide the votes more 
effectually, and so much industry and influence were exerted 
in their favor, that the result in his favor was beyond the 
most sanguine expectations of his friends, and the friends 
of the national honor. In Middlesex, indeed, the votes 
were more divided. Mr. Gorham is a popular man and, 
if the public report be not fallacious, he has been indefatigable for these two years past in the pursuit of this election. 
Mr. Gerry, however, has a respectable majority of votes. 
</p><p>
You mention in one of your letters that Mr. Short is 
commissioned to negotiate the loan. I should wish to know 
where it is expected he will obtain it. I cannot imagine 
that the attempt will be made in France, where the nation 
are so heavily laboring under the weight of their own poverty. 
Holland, I presume, will be the seat of the negotiation. 
And I should be glad to be informed what is the opinion 
of the V[ice] President] with respect to its success. I 
think the value of public paper must depend considerably 
upon it. 
</p><p>
Our court of Common Pleas are sitting in this town, and 
I have made my first essay in addressing a jury. I wish I 
could add that I had acquitted myself to my own satis 
faction. I had very little time for preparation, and did not 
know the existence of the cause three hours before I spoke 
to it. From this circumstance, and from the novelty of 
the situation, added to the diffidence I have always felt of 
my talent at extemporary speechifying, I was too much 
agitated to be possessed of proper presence of mind. You 
may judge of the figure I made.
