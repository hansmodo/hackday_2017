<i>biograper's note</i>
<p>Pilots did not remain long on one boat, as a rule; just why it is not so
easy to understand.  Perhaps they liked the experience of change; perhaps
both captain and pilot liked the pursuit of the ideal.  In the
light-hearted letter that follows--written to a friend of the family,
formerly of Hannibal--we get something of the uncertainty of the pilot's
engagements.</p>
     

<p>To Mrs. Elizabeth W.  Smith, in Jackson,
                      Cape Girardeau County, Mo.:</p>

<p>ST.  Louis, Oct. 31 [probably <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1859">1859</a>].</p>

<p>DEAR AUNT BETSEY,--Ma has not written you, because she did not know when
I would get started down the river again.....</p>

<p>You see, Aunt Betsey, I made but one trip on the packet after you left,
and then concluded to remain at home awhile.  I have just discovered this
morning that I am to go to New Orleans on the "Col.  Chambers"--fine,
light-draught, swift-running passenger steamer--all modern accommodations
and improvements--through with dispatch--for freight or passage apply on
board, or to--but--I have forgotten the agent's name--however, it makes
no difference--and as I was saying, or had intended to say, Aunt Betsey,
probably, if you are ready to come up, you had better take the "Ben
Lewis," the best boat in the packet line.  She will be at Cape Girardeau
at noon on Saturday (day after tomorrow,) and will reach here at
breakfast time, Sunday.  If  Mr. Hamilton is chief clerk,--very well,
I am slightly acquainted with him.  And if Messrs. Carter Gray and Dean
Somebody (I have forgotten his other name,) are in the pilot-house--very
well again-I am acquainted with them.  Just tell Mr. Gray, Aunt Betsey
--that I wish him to place himself at your command.</p>

<p>All the family are well--except myself--I am in a bad way again--disease,
Love, in its most malignant form.  Hopes are entertained of my recovery,
however.  At the dinner table--excellent symptom--I am still as "terrible
as an army with banners."</p>

<p>Aunt Betsey--the wickedness of this world--but I haven't time to moralize
this morning.</p>
                                   
Goodbye</br>
SAM CLEMENS.
