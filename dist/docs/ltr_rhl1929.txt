TO THE GOOD PEOPLE OF VIRGINIA. 
</p><p>
FRIENDS AND FELLOW CITIZENS It is the business of every honest man, when he knows that any thing is about to be done, by which his countrymen will 
be ruined, to give them timely notice of the danger, that they may take proper care to save themselves from the 
destruction that threatens them. I shall, therefore, point out the mischief; I do not doubt, that you will, like brave and free born men, do your endeavour to prevent it.

When your fathers came first from England, to discover and settle this country, they had a right to, and did 
enjoy, the same liberties with the rest of their fellow subjects in England. And the king, at that time, knowing what great benefit it would be to England, to settle this 
country, and what great dangers the first settlers must meet with, did give them his royal word, in an instrument, called a charter, that they and their children, and 
all who came after them, should hold their liberty and property, as the people of England did, and as they 
w^uld have done, had they remained there. Now, one of \he best rights that Englishmen enjoy, is, that their 
property, their living, shall not be taken from them, nor any pcect of it, except by the consent of those members 
or burgesses, whom they shall choose at their elections to represent them. Because, if the burgesses, who are chosen by them, and live among them, and have estates 
among them, should lay a tax upon the country, they will have to pay their proportionable part; and besides, if 
they do wrong, and lay taxes without reason, the people can turn them out, at the new elections. This reasonable right, you know, my contrymen, we have all along 
enjoyed. Nor did one fellow subject in England, ever doubt it, until lately, when the stamp act was passed; 
which, if excuted, it is supposed, would take from this poor country, at least, fifty thousand pounds sterling 
every year; a sum twice as much, as all our taxes by our assembly yet amount to, and ivhich must ruin us all. 
Nay, I question, whether in a few years, we should be able to pay this tax, even though we should sell our lands 
and slaves, with our wives and children into the bargain. And what is worse than this, if the stamp act should go 
down here, the people of England will go on to tax us every year, because the more they tax us, the less necessity 
will there be to tax themselves. And because our freeholders do not vote at their elections for members of 
Parliament, and, therefore, cannot displace them, let them do what they will. As it is well known from these reasons, that the stamp act would certainly ruin the people 
of this colony, by taking away their liberty with their property; many of our worthy countrymen, by their 
conduct at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, the thirty-first of October last, have hitherto prevented this cruel act, from going into 
operation in Virginia; for no paper can now be had, as the stamp master has resigned his office. This I am 
told, is the case in all the other colonies; the people every where, abhorring the act as we do. When this is so well known to be the opinion every where, doe? it 
not deserve your highest indignation, and ought you: not to punish in the severest manner, if he should do, what he has the matchless impudence to declare he will 
do? for he has said, he would clear out his vessel on stamp paper, which he knows where to get from abroad no doubt. Now it is plain, if you permit 
to set this example, other merchants will follow it, and thus the stamp act, which is to destroy our liberty, will be established in trade; from trade, will creep into 
our courts of justice, and from thence, into every branch of business in this country. Now is the time, my countrymen, by nipping in the bud this wicked design, 
to show the world, that you determine to hand down to your children, the liberty given yon by your fathers; and that will not suffer the execution of the stamp 
act, by which you, and your children are to be made slaves, and your property to be taken from you by violence. On this occasion, every one should think alike; 
every one should look on , as the greatest enemy of his country, and who should be punished, unless he immediately give up his intention to use stamp paper, 
and publicly inform us of this change of his opinion. Let us so do with this man, that fear may haunt him in his dreams, and in the day find no safety, while he 
gives every one of you reason to be his enemy, and makes it your duty to be his foe. This self-interested man says, it will be hard on him, not to send out his grain; 
but, will it not be harder on the good people of Virginia, to loose their liberty? And shall we ever agree, 
that the good of all, should be given up for the interest of one man? Let it never be forgotten by my countrymen, that the safety of the people is the supreme law, 
and that no private interest, nor any other consideration, should destroy this.
