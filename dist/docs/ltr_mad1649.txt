DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 3d instant was not received 
till two days ago. It is not certain, however, that the post 
office is chargeable with the delay, the date of its receipt, 
stamped at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, being the 6th of the month.

The. progress of our revenue system continues to be slow. 
The bill rating the duties is still with the Senate. It is said 
that many alterations will be proposed, consisting of reductions 
chiefly. It is said, also, that the proposition for putting Great 
Britain on the same footing with our Allies in all respects, 
prior to a treaty with her, will have a majority in that House, 
and will undergo another agitation in the House of Representatives. It had before three trials in the latter, but it lost 
ground in each, and finally was in a minority of 9 or 10 against 
near 40. I think it an impolitic idea as it relates to our 
foreign interest, and not less so, perhaps, as it relates to the 
popular sentiment of America, particularly of Virginia, and 
still more particularly of that part of it which is already most 
dissatisfied with the new Government. 
</p><p>
I communicated your compliments to the President, who 
received them with professions of his great esteem and regard 
for you, and desired me to make the proper returns for them.
