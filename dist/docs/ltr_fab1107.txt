<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, August 22, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1849">1849</a>
</p><p>
We arrived here on the sixth of this month and if you received my letter from Callao you will see that we had a long passage up the coast. The wind blows constantly from the north and northwest and when, on the fifteenth of July, we found ourselves 1200 miles to the west of this place and losing ground everyday, we began to dispair and to look around for Jonah to cast him into the sea. But we got here without resorting to this.
</p><p>
As we entered this noble Bay, with a cracking breeze, the blue devils that had been haunting us for the last month left and every countenance was radiant. We sailed up about five miles and rounded a point and the City of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a> lay before us. We ran in among a forest of shipping, selected a good berth and after 195 days our anchor once more hooked into Uncle Sam's soil.
</p><p>
In a few minutes we were surrounded with boats. The Captain of the Port came off with John Benson, who remained with us and soon gave us an idea of matters and things. He arrived in April with the company that I was going with. They have split and only part of them continue to dig. John is staying here, speculating in lots.
</p><p>
The first thing was to go ashore and get our letters which we found at Dewitt & Harrison's, and then come off aboard and devour them. I was glad to hear no bad news except the loss of our home. Although I should prefer to find you in Bucksport somewhere, if I should return, yet it may be for Father's best interest to sell out.
</p><p>
I found things here just as I had heard with some few exceptions. The town is growing very fast. You can see it grow every night. It already contains streets and
squares, several large hotels and any quantity of grog shops and gambling saloons. This is carried on with a perfect looseness, night and day. A large number of the houses and stores are merely frames covered with canvas, as it never rains, except in the rainy season, this answers very well.
</p><p>
The situation of the place is very much like Bucksport. The land rises up, however, into high hills back of the town. The whole country is yellow, not a green thing to be seen and not a tree. Right off the town lies the island of Yerba Buena and the shore inside sweeps around in the form of a horseshoe, making a beautiful harbor. There are lying here over 130 vessels, most of them large ships of all nations. The ship of the line Ohio, Steam Ship Mississippi and three other men of war.
</p><p>
The town contains over 5000 inhabitants. Business is brisk. There are thirty or forty new buildings going up. Land is higher than in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a>. The most eligible rent for $500 per month and there is not one can be bought for less than $4000. The Parker House built by Bob Parker is the hotel, not much larger than yours at Bucksport. It rents for $175,000 per year. Board is $25 per week. Common laborers get one dollar an hour or six per day; mechanics $16; carmen, $3 per load.
</p><p>
In spite of the immense quantities of goods brought here the prices of some still keep up. Tin pans are worth $5, saleratus $1.00 a lb, boots and shoes and hard ware are in good demand, but, alas for our fortunes, provisions are plentiful and cheap. Flour has come from Chili and it is only worth $7. They have glutted the market and some are obliged to sell cargoes at auction to keep them from spoiling. This has ruined our prospects, for you know our cargo was wholly provisions. If we could have looked ahead and seen what to bring we could have made our fortunes. Lumber is worth $300 per thousand. We had
on deck 4 houses, 14 by 28 feet, framed. They cost $147 apiece and we have sold them for $4000 and got the dust. I gave one dollar and a half for a tin pail to put it in.
</p><p>
There is plenty of gold here, no doubt of that. It is legal tender and worth $16 the oz. There is no spurious either. That is all humbug. You can't counterfeit it. When we landed our goods at the foot of Sacramento Street, a little ways from the water, our men washed out several grains of gold. It is found in little scales in the sand. This was right in the street. One man stuck to it all day and got five dollars.
</p><p>
The mines are on the forks of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers. The miners average about $16 per day but it is hard and just now hot and sickly. The cost of transportation is so great that it cost them four dollars a day to live. I have seen several of my friends who have returned from the mines, some of them with a thousand dollars, others with a great deal less. From what they have told me I have no desire to go to the diggings. I am satisfied I can make in trade. Land speculation is all the rage and men who bought lots here last winter find themselves rich. We have arrived too late to go into this.
</p><p>
New towns are being laid out every day. There is a large place at the head of navigation, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=sacramento">Sacramento</a> City. Another town at the mouth is called Benicia, the government is building a navy yard here. It is impossible to keep sailors here. They get perfectly crazy and are all off for the diggins. Sunday a boat's crew escaped from the Ohio. They fired on them but without effect. We have kept three of our men by promising to pay them off when the vessel is discharged. The Captain and myself had to take hold and work to land cargo but it's no disgrace here. The steamer got in Monday but I received no letters from her. She will sail on the first.
</p><p>
Friday we go up the river to try the market at S.C.
</p><p>
We can't sell here at wholesale at all. At <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=sacramento">Sacramento City</a> we can tie the brig to the bank and retail out of here, and goods are higher there. If we can rent a lot reasonably we shall put up our house and trade in that. If not, we can sell it for a great price. I think we shall come out whole with the cargo, but no more. We have to pay a pilot from here up, a distance of 150 miles, $400! Captain Cole and I are living on board. We have the cabin all to ourselves. The cook stayed by. They are all going to leave the moment she is made fast at S.C. I don't blame them. Sailors are getting $200 per month to ship on the coast. The ship Greyhound is lying here offering $800 for men to take her home but can't get a man.
</p><p>
I wish I could send you a lump. I have seen some big pieces. The largest we have weighs 1 1/2 oz, and that's nothing. I don't regret coming out at all and just as long as the gold mines last, business will be good.
</p><p>
The country is as quiet and peacable as you can expect where there is no government, no police, no society and where every man does what is right in his own eyes. Sunday is respected but there is no church and no parson. There are more females here than I expected to see. A great many brought their wives but none whom I know.
</p><p>
Write me every steamer. You don't know how I prize a letter in this far-off country.
