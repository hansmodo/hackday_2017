Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Several letters I have received from Jersey and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> mention your having been robbed in April last by 
a number of armed men. It is said, they behaved with 
uncommon respect to you, and humanity towards Peter and 
Nancy. If this be true, they deserve credit for the manner 
in which they executed their purposes. The loss sustained 
on that occasion must have been the more severely felt, as 
the situation of the country, and the injuries you had suffered from the enemy, and the depreciation of the paper 
money, rendered it difficult for you to repair it. I thank 
God, however, that you lost nothing but property â€” your 
lives were spared. I beseech you not to permit an improper degree of delicacy to prevent your deriving such 
succours from me as may from time to time be convenient. 
I assure you, the reflection that my absence may be the 
means of rendering the situation of the family less distressing, makes me more reconciled to it than I otherwise 
should be. You have denied yourself much for the sake of 
your children ; and I am much mistaken if some of them 
have not inherited dispositions somewhat similar to those 
of their parents. Had you been less attentive to my education, I should not have been as and where I am. Economy 
will enable me to give you aid, for though I shall spare no 
expense here which my situation may require, yet a tax 
upon avoidable pleasures, amusements, and luxuries, will 
produce a little fund that may and shall be useful to you. 
In my letter to Frederick I have been more explicit on this 
subject. My love to all the family.

I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your dutiful and affectionate son, 
</p><p>
