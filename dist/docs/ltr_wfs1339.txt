Report No. 44. 
<p></p>
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,

MEXICO, February 2, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1848">1848</a>.

SIR: 
<p></p>
Since my last report (January 13), I have received 
from the War Office letters dated November 8 and IT, 
and December 14. 
<p></p>
My orders, Nos. 362, 376, and 395 of the last year, 
and 15 of the present (heretofore forwarded), will exhibit the system of finance I have established for the 
parts of the country occupied by this army. 
<p></p>
It will be seen that the export duties on coins, and 
the prohibition of the export of bars, varies materially 
from your instructions of November IT, acknowledged 
above. I hope, for the reasons suggested in my report, 
No. 40 (December IT), <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">the President</> may be induced 
to adopt my views in respect to the precious metals. 
<p></p>
I am without reports from commanders of depart 
ments below, on the progress made in collecting the 
direct assessments under my orders and circulars. The 
ctyuntamiento (city council) of the capital has charged 
itself with the payment, on account of the Federal district, of $400,000, of the $668,332 per year, imposed 
on the State of Mexico, and arrangements are in progress to meet that engagement. Two months are now 
due. Brigadier-General Cadwallader, at Toluca, hopes 
soon to begin to collect, through the ayuntamiento of 
that city, a large part of the remainder of the monthly 
assessments, and I have sent Colonel Clarke with a 
small brigade to Cueruavaca (some forty-three miles 
south, on the Acapulco road), to complete the same 
collection. 
<p></p>
The war of masses having ended with the capture 
of this city, the war of detail, including the occupation 
of the country, and the collection of revenue, requires a 
large additional force, as I suggested in my despatch,No. 34.- 
<p></p>
I see that I am, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>, supposed to have 
at my command more than thirty thousand men. Including the forces at Tampico, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a>, on the line 
thence, and in this neighborhood, our total does not exceed twenty-four thousand eight hundred and sixteen. 
Deducting the indispensable garrisons and the sick, I 
have not left a disposable force for distant expeditions 
of more than four thousand five hundred men, and I cfo 
not hear of the approach of any considerable reenforcement. Seven thousand men I deem the minimum 
number necessary to open the important line from 
Durango, through Zacatecas and San Luis, to Tampico. 
Premising that I find it impossible to obtain from the 
volunteers, at a distance, regular returns, I send an 
approximate estimate of all the forces under my immediate orders. The numbers, among the volunteers, 
afflicted with the measles and mumps, in this vicinity, 
continue to be very great, and the erysipelas is common 
among all the corps. 
<p></p>
I write in haste by the express who carries the project of a treaty that Mr. Trist has, at the moment, 
signed with Mexican commissioners. If accepted, I 
hope to receive, as early as practicable, instructions 
respecting the evacuation of this country; the disposition to be made of wagons, teams, cavalry, and artil 
lery horses ; the points in the United States to which I 
shall direct the troops respectively, etc., etc. (I have 
not yet read the treaty, except in small part.) In the 
same contingency, if not earlier recalled (and I under 
stand my recall has been demanded by two of my 
juniors ! ! ), I hope to receive instructions to allow me 
to return to the United States, as soon as I may deem 
the public service will permit, charging some other 
general officer with completing the evacuation, which 
ought, if practicable, to be finished before the return 
of the vomito / say early in May. 
<p></p>
In about forty days I may receive an acknowledgment of this report. By that time, if the treaty be not 
accepted, I hope to be sufficiently reenforced to open 
the commercial line between Zacatecas and Tampico. 
The occupation of Queretaro, Guanajuato, and Guadalajura would be the next in importance, and some of 
the ports of the Pacific, the third. Meanwhile, the collection of internal dues on the precious metals, and the 
direct assessments, shall be continued. 
<p></p>
I enclose a letter from Commodore Shubrick, and 
have the honor to remain, etc., etc.,
