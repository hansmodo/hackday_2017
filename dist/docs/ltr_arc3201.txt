DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
About an hour ago, I received your favor of yesterday. I 
wrote you from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> the night before we left it, to 
inform you that I intended to march to Skenesborough by the 
way of Castleton, and from thence to <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a> ; but when I 
got to Castleton I found the enemy were in possession of Skenesborough, which obliged me to change my route. 
</p><p>
On the march to Castleton, we fell in with a party commanded 
by Captain Frazer, who had been collecting cattle in the country. 
These were immediately dispersed, and a few prisoners taken ; 
but, being reenforced by a strong detachment from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, 
they attacked, in the morning, the rear-guard of our army, who 
had imprudently stopped six miles short of the main body, and 
were, I believe, rather surprised ; notwithstanding which they made a very obstinate defence, and, I have good reason to think, killed 
and wounded a great number of the enemy. As they were at 
too great a distance for me to support them, I sent orders to 
Colonel Warner, who commanded the party, in case he found 
himself too hard pressed, to retreat to Rutland, and join me. He 
is not yet come in, though I have heard that he is coming in 
with about a hundred men; and a great part of the other regiments, except Hall's, have already joined us. 
</p><p>
I am in great distress for provisions. If I can be supplied at 
Manchester, I shall proceed directly for <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a>, or Sara 
toga, as circumstances may direct; if not, I shall be obliged to 
go to <a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a>. I account myself very happy in effecting this 
retreat, as the loss of the army, small as it is, would have been a blow that this part of the country would have felt severely, 
and that must inevitably have happened in a very few days. 
Adieu, my dear General ; I hope to see you soon, or things in a 
better train. 
</p><p>
I am, Sir, your very humble servant, 
</p><p>
ARTHUR ST. CLAIR.
