<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='24'>24th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=columbia' rel='city origin'>COLUMBIA</a>, S. C., <a href='/results.php?year=1862' rel="origin">1862</a>]. I was asked to the Tognos tea, so refused a drive with Mary Preston. As I sat at my solitary case 
mate, waiting for the time to come for the Tognos, saw Mrs. Preston's landau pass, and Mr. Venable making Mary 
laugh at some of his army stories, as only Mr. Venable can. Already I felt that I had paid too much for my whistle 
that is, the Togno tea. The Gibbeses, Trenholms, Edmund Rhett, there. Edmund Rhett has very fine eyes and makes 
fearful play with them. He sits silent and motionless, with his hands on his knees, his head bent forward, and his eyes 
fixed upon you. I could think of nothing like it but a setter and a covey of partridges.

As to <a href='/results.php?tla=jed' rel='acquaintance met'>President Davis</a>, he sank to profounder deeps of 
abuse of him than even Gonzales. I quoted Yancey: " A crew may not like their captain, but if they are mad enough 
to mutiny while a storm is raging, all hands are bound to go to the bottom. After that I contented myself with a 
mild shake of the head when I disagreed with him, and at last I began to shake so persistently it amounted to incipient palsy. " Jeff Davis," he said, " is conceited, wrong-headed, wranglesome, obstinate a traitor." " Now 
I have borne much in silence, said I at last, "but that is pernicious nonsense. Do not let us waste any more time 
listening to your quotations from the Mercury."

He very good-naturedly changed the subject, which was easy just then, for a delicious supper was on the table 
ready for us. But Doctor Gibbes began anew the fighting. He helped me to some pate " Not foie gras," said 
Madame Togno, " pate perdreaux." Doctor Gibbes, how ever, gave it a flavor of his own. " Eat it," said he, " it 
is good for you; rich and wholesome; healthy as cod-liver oil."

A queer thing happened. At the post-office a man saw a small boy open with a key the box of the Governor and the 
Council, take the contents of the box and run for his life. Of course, this man called to the urchin to stop. The urchin 
did not heed, but seeing himself pursued, began tearing up the letters and papers. He was caught and the fragments 
were picked up. Finding himself a prisoner, he pointed out the negro who gave him the key. The negro was arrested.

<a href='/results.php?tla=wfp' rel='acquaintance met'>Governor Pickens</a> called to see me to-day. We began with Fort Sumter. For an hour did we hammer at that 
fortress. We took it, gun by gun. He was very pleasant and friendly in his manner.

James Chesnut has been so nice this winter; so reason able and considerate that is, for a man. The night I 
came from Madame Togno's, instead of making a row about the lateness of the hour, he said he was so wide awake and 
so hungry." I put on my dressing-gown and scrambled some eggs, etc., there on our own fire. And with our feet on 
the fender and the small supper-table between us, we enjoyed the supper and glorious gossip. Rather a pleasant 
state of things when one's own husband is in good humor and cleverer than all the men outside. 
</p><p>
This afternoon, the entente cordiale still subsisting, 
Maum Mary beckoned me out mysteriously, but Mr. Chesnut said : Speak out, old woman ; nobody here but my 
self. " " Mars Nathum Davis wants to speak to her, said she. So I hurried off to the drawing-room, Maum Mary 
flapping her down-at-the-heels shoes in my wake. " He's gwine bekase somebody done stole his boots. How could he 
stay bedout boots? " So Nathan said good-by. Then we met General Gist, Maum Mary still hovering near, and I 
congratulated him on being promoted. He is now a brigadier. This he received with modest complaisance. " I 
knowed he was a general," said Maum Mary as he passed on, he told me as soon as he got in his room bef o his boy 
put down his trunks. 
</p><p>
As Nathan, the unlucky, said good-by, he informed me 
that a Mr. Reed from Montgomery was in the drawing-room and wanted to see me. Mr. Reed had traveled with 
our foreign envoy, Yancey. I was keen for news from abroad. Mr. Reed settled that summarily. " Mr. Yancey 
says we need not have one jot of hope. He could bowstring 
Mallory for not buying arms in time. The very best citizens wanted to depose the State government and take 
things into their own hands, the powers that be being in efficient. Western men are hurrying to the front, bestirring 
themselves. In two more months we shall be ready." What could I do but laugh? I do hope the enemy will be 
considerate and charitable enough to wait for us. 
</p><p>
Mr. Reed's calm faith in the power of Mr. Yancey's eloquence was beautiful to see. He asked for Mr. Chesnut. 
I went back to our rooms, swelling with news like a pouter 
pigeon. Mr. Chesnut said : Well ! four hours a call from Nathan Davis of four hours ! : Men are too absurd ! 
So I bear the honors of my forty years gallantly. I can but laugh. "Mr. Nathan Davis went by the five-o clock 
train", I said "it is now about six or seven, maybe eight. I have had so many visitors. Mr. Reed, of Alabama, is asking for you out there." He went without a word, but I doubt if he went to see Mr. Reed, my laughing had made 
him so angry.

At last <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln</a> threatens us with a proclamation abolishing slavery here in the free Southern Confederacy ; and 
they say <a href='/results.php?tla=gbm' rel=''>McClellan</a> is deposed. They want more fighting I mean the government, whose skins are safe, they want 
more fighting, and trust to luck for the skill of the new generals.
