DEAR MR. CORBIN:
</p><p>
To-morrow evening Mrs. Grant and I start for Washington, Pa., where we will spend a few days, then go to Harrisburgh, Washington, D.C., and
toward the last of the month get around to Elizabeth to spend a few days with you before taking our departure for Europe. We have not
entirely decided whether to take the American line from Philadelphia or the Inman line from New York City. Both have tendered pressing
invitations, and both present good accommodations. If we take the former we will sail on the 9th or 16th of May, if the latter on the 19th.
</p><p>
We had a very pleasant trip West but a little hurried. There is much complaint of dull times but really appearances do not justify it.
Kindest regards of Mrs. Grant and myself to Mother and Jennie.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.
