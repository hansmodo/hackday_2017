Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received the letter, which you did me the honor to 
write on the 27th of last month. 
</p><p>
It is unfortunate, that the administration of St Domingo did 
not make arrangement with the French Minister in Philadelphia, to provide the means for paying their drafts. I have 
given to citizen Genet the necessary instructions for meeting 
them. The government of the Republic has already charged 
that Minister to testify to the President of the United States, 
its just estimate of the efforts made by our compatriots to succor the inhabitants of St Domingo. This act has confirmed 
the opinion, which we have always entertained of their attachment to the French Republic. 
</p><p>
The National Convention, justly indignant at the violences 
committed on board the Little Cherub, have passed the decree, of which I enclose a copy. I hope the reparations ordered by the Representatives of the people will appear to 
you satisfactory. 
</p><p>
I send likewise a copy of a decree, which exempts American ships from the dispositions of the decree of May 9th. I 
am happy to have it in my power to give this new proof of the 
fraternal sentiments of the French people for their allies, and 
of their firm determination to use every means in their power 
to maintain the treaties, which subsist between the two Republics. I have the honor to be,
