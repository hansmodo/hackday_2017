HERE we are at Dr. Nolan's plantation, with <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a> lying just seven miles from us to the east. We 
can surely hear the cannon from here. They are all so kind to us that I ought to be contented; but still 
I wish I was once more at home. I suppose it is very unreasonable in me, but I cannot help it. I miss my 
old desk very much ; it is so awkward to write on my knee that I cannot get used to it. Mine is a nice 
little room upstairs, detached from all the rest, for it is formed by a large dormer window looking to 
the north, from which I have seen a large number of 
guerrillas passing and repassing in their rough costumes, constantly. I enjoy the fresh air, and all 
that, but pleasant as it is, I wish I was at home and all the fuss was over. Virginia Nolan and Miriam 
are already equipped in their riding costumes, so I must lay this down and get ready to join them in a 
scamper across the fields. How delighted I will be to get on a horse again.
