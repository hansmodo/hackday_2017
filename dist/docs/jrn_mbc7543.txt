<a rel='month origin' value='3'>March</a> <a rel='day origin' value='10'>10th</a> [<a href='/results.php?city=montgomery' rel='city origin'>MONTGOMERY</a>, Ala., <a href='/results.php?year=1861' rel="origin">1861</a>]. Mrs. Childs was here to-night (Mary Anderson, from Statesburg), with several children. She is 
lovely. Her hair is piled up on the top of her head oddly. Fashions from France still creep into Texas across Mexican 
borders. Mrs. Childs is fresh from Texas. Her husband is an artillery officer, or was. They will be glad to promote 
him here. Mrs. Childs had the sweetest Southern voice, absolute music. But then, she has all of the high spirit of 
those sweet- voiced Carolina women, too.

Then Mr. Browne came in with his fine English accent, so pleasant to the ear. He tells us that Washington society 
is not reconciled to the Yankee regime. <a href='/results.php?tla=mtl' rel=''>Mrs. Lincoln</a> means to economize. She at once informed the major-domo that 
they were poor and hoped to save twelve thousand dollars 
every year from their salary of twenty thousand. Mr. Browne said <a href='/results.php?tla=jeb' rel=''>Mr. Buchanan's</a> farewell was far more imposing than <a href='/results.php?tla=abl' rel=''>Lincoln's</a> inauguration.

The people were so amusing, so full of Western stories.

Dr. Boykin behaved strangely. All day he had been gaily driving about with us, and never was man in finer spirits. 
To-night, in this brilliant company, he sat dead still as if in a trance. Once, he waked somewhat when a high public 
functionary came in with a present for me, a miniature gondola, "A perfect Venetian specimen," he assured me 
again and again. In an undertone Dr. Boykin muttered: " That fellow has been drinking." " Why do you think 
so? " Because he has told you exactly the same thing four times. Wonderful ! Some of these great statesmen 
always tell me the same thing and have been telling me the same thing ever since we came here.

A man came in and some one said in an undertone, 
" The age of chivalry is not past, O ye Americans! ?; 
" What do you mean ? : That man was once nominated by <a href='/results.php?tla=jeb' rel=''>President Buchanan</a> for a foreign mission, but some Senator stood up and read a paper printed by this man abusive of a woman, and signed by his name in full. After that 
the Senate would have none of him; his chance was gone forever.
