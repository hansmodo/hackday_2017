UNITED STATES SENATE CHAMBER,

</p><p>
Dear Brother : . . . Your reception speech was universally approved. I saw <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant</a> after his return here, and 
he was quite exultant over the whole affair. He takes 
all things tranquilly. . . . 
</p><p>
I am in real embarrassment about questions that I 
must now act upon. My conviction is that specie payments must be resumed, and I have my own theories as 
to the mode of resumption, but the process is a very hard 
one, and will endanger the popularity of any man or 
administration that is compelled to adopt it. Our party 
has no policy, and any proposition will combine all other 
plans in opposition to it. ... 
</p><p>
Affectionately, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jos" rel="me">John Sherman</a>.
