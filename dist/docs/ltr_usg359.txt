MY DEAR MR. CRAMER:
</p><p>
Mrs. Grant and I are now here on our way to the German capital. We
shall probably remain in Berlin until Monday, the first of July. We
shall stop over by the way from Berlin to Copenhagen, particularly at
Hamburg, so as to reach Copenhagen about the fifth of July. If you will
drop me a line to the Kissenhof Hotel, Berlin, to let me know if Mary
will be home at the time designated I shall be obliged. If she is not
to be at home I may change my plan and go direct to Sweden, thence to
Norway, and return thence by Denmark.
</p><p>
Mrs. Grant and I are both well and send much love to Mary and the
children.
</p><p>
Very truly yours,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.
