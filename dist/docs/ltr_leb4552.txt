Sir, 
</p><p>
By the answer you have returned to the letter, which I had 
the honor of writing to you on the thirtieth of August, I see 
that you have misunderstood certain expressions therein contained, and which were used relatively to circumstances. My 
object, in speaking to you of the existing Government, was to 
prove to you that it could not be dissolved, nor lose anything 
of its authority, so long as the nation had an existence. In consequence of this just and incontestible principle, I have sup 
posed that you might reside still in Paris, await here new credentials, and new instructions from your constituents, and, finally, continue to treat upon affairs interesting to both nations. 
</p><p>
You must be persuaded, Sir, that you would have found us 
eager to give you satisfaction, on every point founded in justice and reason. And as, doubtless, you would have brought 
forward no others, the result of our conferences, and of your 
proceedings towards us, would have been followed by the success you desired. 
</p><p>
As to the aversion, which you appear to feel to our present 
government, I think it right to remind you of a fact, which 
comes in aid of the principle just cited. It is this. When the 
inhabitants of North America resolved to separate themselves 
from England, and to gain their liberty, they sent representatives to France, to negotiate with the government, which made 
no difficulty in admitting them to a conference, and even concluding with them a treaty of friendship and commerce, as 
well as of alliance. Hardly had" the United Provinces called 
a Congress, when Dr Franklin was recognised by us in quality 
of Minister Plenipotentiary. He was admitted as one of the 
Diplomatic Corps to the audiences of the Court and the Minister. France, also, on her part, sent an accredited Minister 
to Congress. Yet, Sir, you know, that at that time no decisive measures had been taken for the establishment of a 
government in America, nor could there exist any settled 
government, since war was still carried on for the cause of 
independence and liberty. 
</p><p>
Our present position, therefore, and that of your country at that time, are very different. Of this you will be further convinced by the following fact. 
</p><p>
Before our revolution we had a government, which has subsisted continually since. It has, indeed, taken another 
form, but this form has been thus determined by the liberty 
and safety of the country. Besides, Sir, you, who were born 
in the midst of a free people, should regard the present affairs 
of France in a very different light, from that in which they appear to all other foreign ministers residing in Paris. We 
maintain the same cause with your country ; our principles 
and your own should be the same ; and by a natural train of 
consequences, there can be no reason against your residence in Paris. 
</p><p>
I wish, Sir, that this explanation of facts, as well known to you as to myself, may induce you to reconsider the subject, and decide you to change your resolution. 
</p><p>
However this may be, Sir, I have had the passport prepared, 
which you requested of me ; it is now with the municipality to 
go through the necessary forms. I hope to have it ready 
for you tomorrow. 
</p><p>
You see, Sir, by the subjoined extract from the reply of the 
Minister of Public Contributions, that you have entire satisfaction on every point contained in your letter of the 21st of Au 
gust last. I have the honor to observe to you, that the trifling 
personal casualties you have experienced, with regard to your 
effects, wines, &ic. are, as you are aware, a consequence of 
the agitation inseparable from a great revolution.
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with sincere regard, Sir, your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
