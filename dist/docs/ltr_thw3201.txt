SIR, 
</p><p>
The inclosed recommendation of the Honorable 
House of General Assembly of this State, founded on a recommendation of Congress, has been repeatedly 
under consideration. As we are persuaded that, how 
ever it may be in other States, we cannot reasonably 
expect, in this State, where property is in general 
very equally divided, that farmers will exert them 
selves to enlist their neighbours children in the service, or even the laborers, whom they feel them 
selves in great want of, the Council can devise no 
means by which we can hope so effectually and expeditiously to raise our quota of troops, as by the 
officers of the battalions. If this measure shall meet 
your Excellency's approbation, we request, that you 
</p><p>
" Business for some time past has not been despatched in Congress with 
that degree of celerity, nor, possibly, in some instances, accuracy, which 
the peculiar exigency of these infant States demands ; not owing to 
negligence and inattention of the few members, who now faithfully devote 
their time, and drudge in the service of their country, but to a deficiency 
of numbers necessary for the discharge of the very important matters 
which every new day brings forth. There are, at present, no more than 
twenty-one members on the floor. Of these, three are ordered on a 
Committee to General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>'s camp, and one to visit the hospitals ; 
and, of late, from some unaccountable delinquencies, Congress, in order 
to guard against a total dispersion of the army, have been obliged to act 
personally, by several of its members, Quartermaster-General, Clothier-General, Commissary-General, and, as your Excellency will conclude from 
the intimation just now dropped, Director of Hospitals; and I might, with 
strict propriety, add two or three et ceteras. 
</p><p>
" I have taken the liberty of being so full on this head, in order to 
show your Excellency the necessity for hastening a more ample representation from the State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as well as to apologize for any 
unavoidable delay on the part of Congress ; and I have been urged more 
particularly to do so, from a hint which Mr. Lewis gave me this evening, of his intention to leave us in a few days." 
will please to select two out of each for this purpose, and give them orders to repair to the several 
counties, as soon as may be, on this important service. 
</p><p>
A sum of money will be deposited in the hands 
of the County Lieutenant, or other suitable person, to 
pay the bounty of one hundred dollars ordered by the 
Assembly, over and beside the bounty given by Congress, to each able-bodied recruit, who shall enter any 
of the battalions belonging to the quota of this State, 
for three years, or during the war. The words of 
the recommendation are, of the "twelve battalions," 
but we understand it to have been intended to all the 
battalions. 
</p><p>
The Council had, some time since, set on foot a 
collection of coarse woollens, blankets, shoes, &c., to 
be sent in the common fund in the hands of the 
Clothier-General. Very lately, Congress, departing 
from their former system, resolved that each State 
do endeavour to supply the present nessities of its 
troops. Agreeably to this, the Council immediately 
proceeded to bring a large quantity of woollens, 
which was concealed or neglected in Buck's county, 
to the supply of the distressed soldiers. The tailors 
have made considerable progress in making them up. 
They calculate that they will produce near one thou 
sand coats and waistcoats for privates, and a .few 
breeches. These goods seem not so fit for officers, 
except some surtouts would be thought acceptable. 
Your Excellency's direction concerning the distribution 
will be useful, as the Council are satisfied that you 
wish the most pressing necessity to be first relieved. 
</p><p>
The Assembly, in the exigence of our army at this 
inclement season, have gone into the most vigorous 
mode of relief, but a mode that cannot be continued 
nor renewed, consistent with trade and manufacture. 
They have invested two Commissioners, in each county, 
with power to seize and take all necessaries suitable 
to the purpose, in whatever hands they may be 
found ; and they have appointed Colonel Francis 
Johnston to receive and distribute the clothing as 
ordered by the Council. By this means it may be 
expected that great additions may be made to the 
clothing already made up and making. 
</p><p>
The officers, whose wants it is believed are very 
pressing, will be in some measure relieved ; but it 
cannot be expected that powers, of this extraordinary 
nature, can be exerted to procure any other goods 
than warmth and decency require. Lieutenant Peter 
son, of the eighth Pennsylvania battalion, applied to 
the Council for clothing for himself and several officers. At the foot hereof we transcribe, from his application, a specimen of their wants. 
</p><p>
The call upon the State was thought to be for 
covering for the naked part of the army ; and as no 
idea that fine ruffled shirts, laced hats, or even fine ones of beaver, silken stockings, or fine scarlet cloth, 
came under this description, no provision for these 
has been made, nor can be expected. Your Excellency can best judge whether any precaution may be 
necessary to prevent such officers, as intend shortly 
to resign, from obtaining a supply of the clothing 
expected to be delivered out. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.,
