SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 28th of November, by Captain 
Blewer, being received, was immediately laid before 
Congress. 
</p><p>
By my letter of the 2d instant, which I hope you will in due time receive, you will perceive the Congress have, in a great measure, prevented your wishes, 
having written to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and given orders to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a> to supply you with, and to forward, 
with all possible expedition, what cannon can be 
spared. They have also directed <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a> to 
make diligent search for lead ; and, retaining so much 
as may be wanted there, to send the remainder to 
your camp. However, it is hoped the gentlemen you 
have sent will expedite that business. 
</p><p>
By order of Congress, I forward a commission for <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague'>Mr. Knox</a>, who is appointed Colonel of the Regiment 
of Artillery. The Congress also have relieved your 
difficulties with respect to the two battalions of Marines, having ordered that the raising them out of 
the army be suspended. It is the desire of Congress 
that such a body of forces may be raised ; but their 
meaning is, that it be in addition to the army voted; 
and they expect you will think of proper persons to 
command that corps, and give orders for enlisting 
them wherever they may be found. 
</p><p>
The Congress are sensibly affected with your situation, and regret the backwardness of the troops to 
re enlist. In addition to what I had the honor of 
transmitting you the 2d instant, they have desired 
me to inclose you a copy of a resolution passed yesterday, and to write to the Council of Massachusetts 
Bay, the Convention of New Hampshire, and the 
Governors of Rhode Island and Connecticut, acquainting  them with the present state of the army, and in 
closing copies of the resolutions of this Congress 
relative to your being empowered to call forth the 
militia of those Governments on any emergency, and 
requesting those Colonies to exert themselves in defence of our common liberties, by affording you all 
the aid in their power, and to comply with your request for the assistance of the militia, whenever you 
may find it necessary to call for it. 
The gentlemen with the money set out to-day. I 
hope the arrival of this will relieve some of your 
difficulties; and that the payment of the arrears, and 
the month's advance, which you arc empowered to 
offer, will induce many to reenlist, who seem not to 
be actuated by nobler motives. 
</p><p>
By letters, received yesterday, we learn that <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>Colonel Arnold</a>, after a fatiguing march, had reached Canada, where he was well received by the inhabitants 
that, on the 14th of November, he had reached Point 
Levi, and was preparing to pass the river that night; 
that, notwithstanding his being deserted by Colonel 
Enos, he had great hopes of gaining possession of 
Quebec, as both the English and Canadian inhabitants 
were well affected to our cause ; that Carleton, with 
the ships under his command, was stopped in his 
passage down the river by a fort in our possession, 
at the mouth of the Sorel, and some row-galleys ; and 
that <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague'>General Montgomery</a> was preparing to attack 
him from Montreal. But of these matters you will 
doubtless be more fully informed by an express, which 
we understand was despatched to you from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
