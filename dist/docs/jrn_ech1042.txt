This afternoon papers were brought up by special express from Stockton, announcing the death of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat" rel="">General Zachary Taylor</a>, late President of the United States. The announcement created considerable feeling, and the Locos rave that so thorough a Whig as Fillmore should succeed him in the presidency.

On a Sabbath evening some of our best citizens sit down in front of a drinking house and sing such songs as "Dearest Mae," "O, Susanna," and "Uncle Ned." Sunday is a great day here. Business is more active and there is more frolic on this day than in the whole of the other six. In the morning we have public auctions, in the afternoon the bullfight and the circus, and in the evening the circus and Dr. Collier's troupe of Model Artists, together with numerous fandango rooms, dance houses, and scores of gambling hells. While I am writing, my friends at home perhaps are at church; here the fife and drum are calling the people to the circus.

I have worked very steadily in the office all day. This evening Atkins and I concluded to indulge in a little wine and sugar, and therefore sent and had a bottle brought. After turning off a glass each, we have concluded to attend a fandango up town, where we will perhaps remain until midnight, looking at the Americans dancing with the Mexican señoritas.
