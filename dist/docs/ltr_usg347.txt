MY DEAR MR. CORBIN:
</p><p>
Jennie's and your letter is just received. I shall not be in New York, nor away from Washington, until after the meeting of Congress. But I
will gladly give you the hour or two you speak of if you come to Washington. If you and Jennie could come this week we could make a
spare room without inconvenience. Mrs. Smith--of Washington, Pa., with her two children--are with us, but they can be put in the room with their mother.
</p><p>
The alarm about the removal of Holden as Collector of Internal Revenue for the Covington district is premature. There was a raid made upon
him by a person in whom I take no stock , and a statement made in regard to him which I said--if proved true--would mean that he must go
out. But I think that rumor was entirely dispelled.
</p><p>
My Message is not "blocked out," nor scarcely thought of. So many other exciting matters preoccupy my time and thoughts that I do not bother
myself about the other. I shall trust to the inspiration of the moment for what I shall say. Will be brief, but to the point if I can.
</p><p>
Yours truly,
</p>
U.S. GRANT.
