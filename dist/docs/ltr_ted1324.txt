My Dear Sister
</p><p>
I commenced writing to you some months ago but the letter was laid aside to be finished the next day & was never touched. A nice sheet of pink letter paper was taken out & has got so much soiled that it cannot  be written upon & now in the midst of preparation for starting across the mountains I am seated on the grass in the midst of the tent to say a few words to my dearest & only sister. One would suppose that I loved her but little or I should have not neglected her so long. But I have heard from you by Mr Greenleaf & every month have intended to write. My three daughters are round me one at my side trying to sew Georgeanna fixing herself up in old indiarubber cap & Eliza Poor knocking on my paper & asking me ever so many questions. They often talk to me of Aunty Poor. I can give you no idea of the hurry of the place at this time. It is supposed there will be 7000 waggons start from this place this season We go to California, to the bay of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. It is a four months trip. We have three waggons furnished with food & clothing &c. drawn by three yoke of oxen each. We take cows along & milk them & have some butter though not as much as we would like. I am willing to go & have no doubt it will be an advantage to our children & to us. I came here last evening & start tomorrow morning on the long journey. Wm's family was well when I left Springfield a month ago. He will write to you soon as he finds another home He says he has received no answer to his two last letters, is about to start to Wisconsin as he considers Illinois unhealthy.

Farewell, my sister, you shall hear from
me as soon as I have an opportunity,
Love to Mr. Poor, the children & all friends.

Farewell
