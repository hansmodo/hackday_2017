I wish I had no occasion to send my dear General this melancholy account. My amiable friend, the gallant Montgomery, is no more ; the brave Arnold is 
wounded; and we have met with a severe check in an unsuccessful attempt on Quebec. May Heaven be graciously pleased that the misfortune may terminate 
here ! I tremble for our people in Canada ; and no thing, my dear Sir, seems left to prevent the most fatal consequences, but an immediate reinforcement 
that is nowhere to be had but from you; and the only route, that which I have pointed out in my letter to Congress, copy of which you have inclosed. 
Nor do I think that a less number than I have mentioned will suffice. Should your Excellency think proper to send the troops, you will please to let me 
know it by express, that I may send provisions to Onion River.

Congress has wrote to me on the subject of my request to retire. Our affairs are much worse than when I made the request. This is motive sufficient 
for me to continue to serve my country in any way I can be thought most serviceable; but my utmost can be but little, weak and indisposed as I am. The 
clothing is gone to <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>. 
</p><p>
I am your Excellency's most obedient and most humble servant,
