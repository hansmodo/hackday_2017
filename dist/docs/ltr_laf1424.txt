TO MADAME DE LAFAYETTE.

If my last letter, my dearest love, written five or six days ago, was
closed hastily, I hope at least that the American captain, whom I then
believed to be a French one, will remit it to you as soon as possible.
That letter announced to you that I had landed safely in this country,
after having suffered a little from sea-sickness during the first weeks
of my voyage; that I was staying with a very kind officer, in whose
house I was received upon my arrival; that I had been nearly two months
at sea, and was anxious to continue my journey immediately; that letter
spoke of everything which interests my heart most deeply, of my regret
at having quitted you, of your pregnancy, and of our dear children; it
told you, also, that I was in perfect health. I repeat this extract
from it, because the English may very possibly amuse themselves by
seizing it on its way. I place, however, so much confidence in my lucky
star, that I hope it will reach you safely. That same star has
protected me to the astonishment of every person; you may, therefore,
trust a little to it in future, my love, and let this conviction
tranquillize your fears. I landed after having sailed for several days
along a coast swarming with hostile vessels. On my arrival here every
one told me that my ship must undoubtedly be taken, because two English
frigates had blockaded the harbour. I even sent, both by land and sea,
orders to the captain to put the men on shore, and burn the vessel, if
he had still the power of doing so. Well! by a most extraordinary piece
of good fortune, a sudden gale of wind having blown away the frigates
for a short time, my vessel arrived at noon-day, without having
encountered friend or foe. At <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charlestown" rel="city">Charlestown</a> I have met with General Howe,
a general officer, now engaged in service. The governor of the state is
expected this evening from the country. All the persons with whom I
wished to be acquainted have shewn me the greatest attention and
politeness (not European politeness merely); I can only feel gratitude
for the reception I have met with, although I have not yet thought
proper to enter into any detail respecting my future prospects and
arrangements. I wish to see the congress first. I hope to set out in
two days for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, which is a land journey of more than two
hundred and fifty leagues. We shall divide into small parties; I have
already purchased horses and light carriages for this purpose. There
are some French and American vessels at present here, who are to sail
out of the harbour in company to-morrow morning, taking advantage of a
moment when the frigates are out of sight: they are numerous and armed,
and have promised me to defend themselves stoutly against the small
privateers they will undoubtedly meet with. I shall distribute my
letters amongst the different ships, in case any accident should happen
to either one of them.
</p><p>
I shall now speak to you, my love, about the country and its inhabitants, who are as agreeable as my enthusiasm had led me to
imagine. Simplicity of manner, kindness of heart, love of country and of liberty, and a delightful state of equality, are met with
universally. The richest and the poorest man are completely on a level; and although there are some immense fortunes in this country, I may
challenge any one to point out the slightest difference in their respective manner towards each other. I first saw and judged of a
country life at Major Hughes's house: I am at present in the city, where everything somewhat resembles the English customs, except that
you find more simplicity here than you would do in England. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charlestown" rel="city">Charlestown</a> is one of the best built, handsomest, and most agreeable cities that I
have ever seen. The American women are very pretty, and have great simplicity of character; and the extreme neatness of their appearance
is truly delightful: cleanliness is everywhere even more studiously attended to here than in England. What gives me most pleasure is to see
how completely the citizens are all brethren of one family. In America there are none poor, and none even that can be called peasants. Each
citizen has some property, and all citizens have the same rights as the richest individual, or landed proprietor, in the country. The inns are
very different from those of Europe; the host and hostess sit at table with you, and do the honours of a comfortable meal; and when you
depart, you pay your bill without being obliged to tax it. If you should dislike going to inns, you may always find country houses in
which you will be received, as a good American, with the same attention that you might expect in a friend's house in Europe.
</p><p>
My own reception has been most peculiarly agreeable. To have been
merely my travelling companion, suffices to secure the kindest welcome.
I have just passed five hours at a large dinner given in compliment to
me by an individual of this town. Generals Howe and Moultrie, and
several officers of my suite, were present. We drank each other's
health, and endeavoured to talk English, which I am beginning to speak
a little. I shall pay a visit to-morrow, with these gentlemen, to the
governor of the state, and make the last arrangements for my departure.
The next day, the commanding officers here will take me to see the town
and its environs, and I shall then set out to join the army. I must
close and send my letter immediately, because the vessel goes to-night
to the entrance of the harbour, and sails to-morrow at five o'clock. As
all the ships are exposed to some risk, I shall divide my letters
amongst them. I write to M M. de Coigny, de Poix, de Noailles, de S?gur, and to Madame d'Ayen. If either of these should not receive
my letter, be so kind as to mention this circumstance.
</p><p>
From the agreeable life I lead in this country, from the sympathy which
makes me feel as much at ease with the inhabitants as if I had known
them for twenty years, the similarity between their manner of thinking
and of my own, my love of glory and of liberty, you might imagine that
I am very happy: but you are not with me, my dearest love; my friends
are not with me; and there is no happiness for me when far from you and
them. I often ask you if you still love, but I put that question still
more often to myself and my heart ever answers, yes: I trust that heart
does not deceive me. I am inexpressibly anxious to hear from you; I
hope to find some letters at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. My only fear is that the
privateer which was to bring them to me should have been captured on
her way. Although I can easily imagine that I have excited the especial
displeasure of the English, by taking the liberty of coming hither in
spite of them, and landing before their very face, yet I must confess
that we shall be even more than on a par if they succeed in catching
that vessel, the object of my fondest hopes, by which I am expecting to
receive your letters. I entreat you to send me both long and frequent
letters. You are not sufficiently conscious of the joy with which I
shall receive them. Embrace, most tenderly, my Henriette: may I add,
embrace our children? The father of those poor children is a wanderer,
but he is, nevertheless, a good, honest man,--a, good father, warmly
attached to his family, and a good husband also, for he loves his wife
most tenderly. Present my compliments to your friends and to mine; may
I not say 'our' friends? with the permission of the Countess Auguste and Madame de Fronsac. By 'my friends', you know that I mean my own
dear circle, formerly of the court, and which afterwards became the
society of _the wooden sword_; we republicans like it the better
for the change. This letter will be given you by a French captain, who,
I think, will deliver it into your own hands; but I must confide to you
that I have an agreeable anticipation for to-morrow, which is to write
to you by an American, who will sail on the same day, but at a later
hour. Adieu, then, my dearest love; I must leave off for want of time
and paper; and if I do not repeat ten thousand times that I love you,
it is not from want of affection, but from my having the vanity to hope
that I have already convinced you of it. The night is far advanced, the
heat intense, and I am devoured by gnats; but the best countries, as
you perceive, have their inconveniences.

Adieu, my love, adieu.
