Mr. P. S. Worsley.
</p><p>
My Dear Sir:  I have received the copy of your translation of the
Iliad which you so kindly presented to me.  Its perusal has been my
evening's recreation, and I have never more enjoyed the beauty and
grandeur of the poem than as recited by you.  The translation is as
truthful as powerful, and faithfully represents the imagery and rhythm
of the bold original.  The undeserved compliment in prose and verse,
on the first leaves of the volume, I received as your tribute to the
merit of my countrymen, who struggled for constitutional government.
</p><p>
          With great respect,
</p><p>
                  Your obedient servant,
</p><p>
                             <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rel" rel="me">R. E. Lee.</a>.
