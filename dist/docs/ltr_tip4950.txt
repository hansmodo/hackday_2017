HONOURED SIR : It is the common opinion of people 
that to play a game at cards is (almost) an unpardonable 
crime. But what renders it more odious than other diver 
sions ? Is it because more time is spent in it than in other 
diversions ? But why is more time spent ? Because this is 
a pleasanter and more sociable entertainment. And what 
makes it so entertaining in general is, that less pains and 
care need be used than in some other diversions ; whereas 
in playing checkers, instead of unbending the mind, after 
its labour, there is more thought and care to be used, and 
so can be no relief to the tired intellect. Besides, it is 
a dull, unsociable business ; and a stranger would rather 
think they were exercised with a fit of the spleen, than 
a diversion, to see them poring upon a piece of board, 
and looking with as much intenseness of thought as if 
the fate of empires depended upon the right forming 
their plan.

People are apt to say that cards, as it were, intoxicate 
those that use them, and that thereby they squander away 
their money ; that they are a thief of time ; are apt to raise 
disputes, &c. But what one thing is there which may not 
be used to excess? Are not other diversions subject to 
the same evils, if practised beyond measure and prudence? 
Why then so great an outcry against cards, as if they were 
the only evil? Even the diversion of checkers may be 
abused ; and may persons game and spend their time and 
money at one, so may they at the other. 
</p><p>
I would not forget to acquaint you, Sir, that you were 
misinformed with regard to my playing cards ; and am sorry 
I have been the cause (through the ignorance of that block 
head) of any trouble or uneasiness in the breast of so kind, 
so loving a father, from whom any gentle admonitions, 
reproofs, or advice would be received with that respect 
and regard due to so affectionate a father by your dutiful son,
