MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THIS morning I received your favor of the 21st of 
January. I am sure your people do a great deal of 
work, so don t be concerned. I am very well satisfied with your agricultural diary. 
</p><p>
The venerable governor made the best speech he 
ever made, but the old leven ferments a little in it. 
I wonder you had not received two letters from T., 
which I enclosed to you. I now enclose you one from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Jay</a>, which shows that our sons were arrived in 
Holland, and had passed through their ceremonies at 
the <a href='/results.php?city=hague' rel='city'>Hague</a>, and gone to <a href='/results.php?city=amsterdam' rel='city'>Amsterdam</a> to look, as I sup 
pose, after the imprudent Van Staphorst and American money in his hands. 
</p><p>
The enclosed postscript to Dunlap will show you 
that the expectation of a treaty hourly to arrive, will 
not allow me to leave my chair till the fourth of 
March. I shall be charged with deserting the President, forsaking the Secretary of State, betraying my 
friend <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met friend'>Jay</a>, abandoning my post, and sacrificing my 
country to a weak attachment to a woman, and a 
weaker fondness for my farm, if I quit at this moment. So, be thou thankful alone, that thou hast a 
good husband here, that thy children are safe and in 
honor in Europe, and that thy daughter has given 
thee a fine grand-daughter; besides innumerable blessings to thy country. I will be thankful and joyous 
here all alone. 
</p><p>
We momently expect the treaty ; but it may not 
arrive this month. When it does, I expect to see 
wry faces as well as smiling ones. Perhaps much 
debate may take place. Let us know what it is first, 
however, before we oppose, or criticise, or applaud, 
or approve. Your son John says it is better than war. 
That is all I know about it. 
</p><p>
Tenderly adieu.
