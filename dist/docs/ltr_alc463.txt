My good old Friend: --
</p><p>
   I have been somewhat dis
appointed in not seeing you up here to
see the men playing soldier, and now since
Gov. Curtin is expected here tomorrow, (Saturday)
I will feel sure that you are coming, and look
for you, my but they do look pretty, Just
come and see. Three Regiments were in yesterday
afternoon and make a long line of people, who
with their glittering bayonets under the rays of the
shining sun, accompanied by their Bands, or marshal
music, and the heavy and steady tramp of three
thousand men, make all who stand and look
on, feel, that they are not soldiers, all this can
but give a very faint idea of the appearance of one hun
dred and fifty thousand human beings marched into the field
of battle by the warming and thrilling sound of
</p><p>
almost countless drums and Oh! what, or who can
describe the feeling of that immense congregation
of human souls when the sound of the booming
cannon first disturbs the quiet of that breast and
paints death and destruction all around. We may
try to form some idea of the scene presented by
a battlefield, both while in the actual contest
and after, but can never, in my opinion, realize
the horrors of such a sight until we ourselves behold
it, and such; humanity forbids us from wishing.
May it never be seen in our land, but may the
Flag continue to wave over the land of the free and
the home of the brave.
</p><p>
    Aunt Lydia and Uncle Kyner spoke of coming to see the
soldiers and as you no doubt will not object to
having an errand there, you can tell them that
saturday will no doubt be a suitable day as
we expect all the soldiers in town while Curtin
is here. I have been expecting to read your letter
before this time, but suppose you are preparing to
keep me reading one day when it comes, which I will
gladly do. Mine to all inquiring friends.
</p><p>
Yours &c
</p><p>
Little Ellic

Excuse this side as I thought I had it full.
You can guess what is not written, now
Good-bye.
