...That indeed was a glorious victory and has lightened the pressure
upon our front amazingly.  Do not grieve for the brave dead.  Sorrow
for those they left behind--friends, relatives, and families.  The
former are at rest.  The latter must suffer.  The battle will be
repeated there in greater force.  I hope God will again smile on us
and strengthen our hearts and arms.  I wished to partake in the former
struggle, and am mortified at my absence, but the President thought
it more important I should be here.  I could not have done as well as
has been done, but I could have helped, and taken part in the struggle
for my home and neighbourhood.  So the work is done I care not by whom
it is done.  I leave to-morrow for the Northwest Army.  I wished to
go before, as I wrote you, and was all prepared, but the indications
were so evident of the coming battle, and in the uncertainty of the
result, the President forbade my departure.  Now it is necessary and
he consents.  I cannot say for how long, but will write you....  I
inclose you a letter from Markie [Miss Martha Custis Williams--second
cousin of my mother, afterward Mrs. Admiral Carter, U.S.N.].  Write
to her if you can and thank her for her letter to me.  I have not
time.  My whole time is occupied, and all my thoughts and strength
are given to the cause to which my life, be it long or short, will be
devoted.  Tell her not to mind the reports she sees in the papers.
They are made to injure and occasion distrust.  Those that know me
will not believe them.  Those that do not will not care for them.  I
laugh at them.  Give love to all, and for yourself accept the constant
prayers and love of truly yours,
