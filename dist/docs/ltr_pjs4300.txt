Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
By yesterday's post we were advised of your Excellency's arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>; and if a variety of 
incidents did not concur to prevent me, I should have the honor, in person, to congratulate you on the 
gratitude and confidence which you so eminently experience from United America. 
</p><p>
Until the adoption of the present system of National Government, it was a constant and a painful 
reflection to every patriot, that the inefficacy of the late Confederation threatened to deprive America of 
those blessings, for which she was greatly indebted to 
your persevering exertions, in surmounting the obstacles which were opposed to her becoming independent. And permit me to assure you that the distress 
of my feelings was infinitely increased, from a contemplation of what I could realize must be yours on 
the sad occasion. 
</p><p>
But anxiety is now at an end. The impending 
clouds are dispelled, and a happy prospect is presented to the view. For why should we doubt that the 
Divine hand, which has so evidently interfered in 
favor of America, and so remarkably assisted and conducted you in every stage of life, and continue to 
guide and direct you in your endeavours for the happiness of your country ? Let me join my wish to the universal one, that health, happiness, and every 
blessing, may be your portion. I am, dear Sir, with affectionate and sincere esteem and respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
