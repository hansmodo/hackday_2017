SIR, 
</p><p>
I have just completed a brigade return for the vacancies in the different regiments. My brigade is so dispersed that it is difficult getting returns seasonably. I should have made this return yesterday, but could not get Colonel Hand's until last evening. 
</p><p>
The outguards report nothing worthy your Excellency's notice this morning. 
</p><p>
I am so confined, writing passes, &c., that it is impossible for me to attend to the duties of the day, which, in many instances, prejudices the service. Such 
a confined situation leaves one no opportunity of viewing things for themselves. It is recommended, by one of the greatest Generals of the age, not only 
to issue orders, but to see to the execution ; for the army being composed of men of indolence, if the commander is not attentive to every individual in the 
different departments, the machine becomes dislocated, and the progress of business retarded. 
</p><p>
The science or art of war requires a freedom of 
thought, and leisure to reflect upon the various incidents that daily occur, which cannot be had where 
the whole of one's time is engrossed in clerical employments. The time devoted to this employment is 
not the only injury I feel ; but it confines my thoughts as well as engrosses my time. It is like a merchandise of small wares. 
</p><p>
I must beg leave to recommend to your Excellency's consideration the appointing an officer to write and sign the necessary passes. The person I should 
wish to be appointed is Lieutenant Bio d get. If it was put in general orders, that passes signed by him should be deemed authentic, as if signed by me, it 
would leave me at liberty to pursue the more important employments of my station. 
</p><p>
I hope your Excellency will not think this application results from a lazy habit, or a desire to free myself from business. Far from it. I am never more 
happy than when I am honorably or usefully employed. If your Excellency thinks I can promote the service as much in this employment as in any other, 
</p><p>
I shall cheerfully execute the business, without the least murmur. 
</p><p>
I am, with all due respect, your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
