DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
There are not in the profession many gentlemen inhabit 
ing this town whose characters are remarkably formidable 
from their respectability. Mr. Sullivan does more business 
I suppose than any four others put together. I shall care 
fully remember the cautions in one of your letters respect 
ing him ; whatever other qualities he may possess, he may 
safely be taken as a model for industry and activity. "I 
believe," said Parson Clarke to [me] the other day "that 
man has not a particle of indolence in his nature." He 
treats me civilly, and it is all I wish. I have derived even 
some instruction from his private conversation as well as from his arguments at the bar, and the other day he gave 
me a caution, which made a singular impression upon my 
mind. I was sitting next to him within the bar at Concord. 
He took from his finger a ring, and pointed to me the motto 
engraved within the rim. It was "Weigh the Consequences." 
Fas est et ab hoste doceri. Perhaps the benefit of the ad 
monition may not be lost in its influence upon my conduct 
towards the man himself. I have no desire to render my 
self personally obnoxious to him, and I trust I shall always 
disdain to court his favor. 
</p><p>
Mr. Tudor l is an ingenious, amiable, indolent man, who 
will always make a respectable figure in society, but who 
has not activity or application enough ever to arrive to 
the foremost rank of eminence in his profession. Your 
personal acquaintance with him has made his character 
better known to you than it is to me; my opinion of him 
has been formed from the information of persons more 
conversant with him, and confirmed in some measure by 
my own observation. 
</p><p>
Mr. Dawes, in addition to a similar indolence of dis 
position, labors under the disadvantage of ill health ; he 
is supported by a very considerable weight of paternal 
influence, but his exertion has been blunted by the expectation of a large patrimonial property he married too 
young. To avoid an early matrimonial connection, was 
one of the principles which I think I have heard you say 
was recommended to you by Mr. Gridley. Happiness in 
life I am fully persuaded must be derived principally form 
domestic attachments ; but a foundation must be laid before the superstructure can be erected. I hope I am in no 
danger from this quarter. 
</p><p>
Mr. Gore is one of those men whom Cardinal Richelieu 
would have employed in public affairs. He is a very fortunate man. In his profession he has been remarkably 
successful ; from a combination of circumstances, which a 
man of inferior abilities to those he possesses might per 
haps have improved as well. The family connections have 
likewise been extremely serviceable to him ; and it is said 
that he has made an independent fortune by speculation in 
the public funds. I have heard it asserted that he is the 
richest lawyer in the Commonwealth. 
</p><p>
Mr. Amory has also been successfully engaged in speculating upon public securities, as well as Mr. Wetmore and 
Mr. Otis. This employment does not appear to be very 
intimately connected with the profession. But these gentle 
men I am told have played at that hazardous game with monies deposited in their hands ; and have been enabled 
by the temporary possession of property belonging to foreigners, to become masters of sums to an equal amount 
before they have been called upon for payment. Amory is 
very attentive to his business, and has recommended him 
self by the expedition with which he performs that which 
is entrusted to him. He is a student too ; but I think 
confines his researches rather too much within the circle 
of mere professional information. 
</p><p>
Otis appears to me to be advancing very rapidly to eminence. There is certainly no man in the town of the profession who unites so many of those qualities which are 
calculated to attract the popular attention. He has been 
but four years at the bar, yet excepting Sullivan, I believe there is no one here who has a greater proportion of business. But his ambition has no limits, and I strongly suspect 
that the honors of a public station have such allurements 
to his mind that he will catch with ardor at the first opportunity to become a public man. Such an opportunity will 
perhaps be presented to him before long, and if he should 
once get entangled in the political web, it may be presumed 
he will like most others find it inextricable. These are the 
persons who share among themselves the principal business 
which is done in this town. Mr. Lowell has a son, who 
was just sworn into court at the time of his appointment, 
and to whom he has conveniently left all his unfinished 
business. The young gentleman has talents, activity and 
application, with a great degree of confidence in himself; 
a quality which is not amiable, but which perhaps is very 
serviceable to him, in helping him forward. His peculiar 
advantages have given him an unusual share of business, 
for a person so lately admitted. He is rather disposed to 
attribute the circumstance to his superior abilities ; and 
expresses some contempt for persons less successful than 
himself, because depending solely upon their own characters. . . .
