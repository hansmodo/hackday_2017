Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In another letter of this date, I have mentioned a part of 
yesterday's conversation with the Count de Montmorin. That 
part of it, which I am now to communicate, is for yourself alone. 
As <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a> had asked me some days ago, who 
should be I seat to replace the Comte de JMoustiers, and upon 
my answering with great indifference, that it might be whom he 
pleased, had asked my opinion of Colonel Ternant, I told the 
Count de Montmorin this circumstance ; to which he replied, that 
he had communicated his intention to <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a> 
some time since, in consequence of the intimacy which has long 
subsisted between them. I asked him if he would permit me 
to mention it to you. The idea gave him pleasure, and he 
told me that he should consider it as a very great kindness, and 
particularly if through the same channel he could learn 
whether that appointment would be agreeable to you. This is you know a compliment, which the most respectable courts 
on this side of the Atlantic usually pay to each other. It is 
not without use, and on the present occasion is not a mere 
compliment, because Monsieur de Montmorin is sincerely desirous of cultivating a good understanding with the United 
States. 
</p><p>
It is not impossible that he may retreat from his present 
office ; but he will I think in that case be appointed Governor to the children of France, and his opinions, while about 
the court, will have weight, for many reasons ; amongst others, 
because they deserve it. In talking over the deplorable situation to which this kingdom is reduced, I told him that I saw 
no means of establishing peace at home, but by making war 
abroad. He replied that he thought with me in part, viz. that 
an offensive war might be useful, but that he thought a defensive war must prove ruinous. That this last seemed the 
more likely to happen, and that in either case the state of the 
finances was alarming. [ observed, that ability in that department might restore it, even during a war ; that nothing could 
revive credit without the re-establishment of executive authority, and that nothing could effect that re-establishment but a 
general sense of the necessity. Upon this, he lamented the 
want of a chief minister, who might embrace the great whole 
of public business. He owns himself unequal to the task, and 
too indolent into the bargain. 
</p><p>
Our friend Lafayette burns with desire to be at the head of 
an army in Flanders, and drive the Stadtholder into a ditch. 
He acts now a splendid, but dangerous part. Unluckily } he 
has given in to measures, as to the constitution, which he does 
not heartily approve, and he heartily approves many things 
which experience will demonstrate to be injurious. While all 
is in confusion here, the revolt of Austrian Flanders, and the 
troubles excited in Poland by the agency of Prussia, give 
every reason to suppose that the King of Sweden will be vigorously supported ; so that provided the Turk has but a sufficient share of obstinacy to bear a little more beating, the scale, 
according to human probabilities, must turn against Austria 
and Prussia, who are the allies of France. Great Britain is, 
as yet, no otherwise engaged than as an eventual party; and, 
according to the best opinion which my judgment can form, 
upon the information I have been able to obtain, the Premier 
of that country can, to use the words of Mr Addison,  rise in 
the whirlwind and direct the storm. A person, however, on 
whose knowledge I have some reliance, assures me that Mr Pitt, engrossed by borough politics and ignorant of continent 
al affairs, takes no part in them, but what he is absolutely 
forced into, and I am inclined to believe that there is some 
truth in that assertion. Accept I pray the assurances of that 
sincere esteem with which I am yours, &c.
