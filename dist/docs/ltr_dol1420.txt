I received, dear sir, in due time the communication from Congress, made more 
grateful to me by the kind sympathy which accompanied it. 
</p><p>
The high and just estimation of my husband by my countrymen and friends, and their generous participation in the sorrow 
occasioned by our irretrievable loss, expressed through its supreme authorities and otherwise, is the only solace of which 
my heart is susceptible on the departure of him, who had never lost sight of that consistency, symmetry, and beauty of character in all its parts, which rendered his own 
transcendent as a whole and worthy of the best aspirations. 
</p><p>
I am now preparing to execute the trust his confidence reposed in me, that of placing before Congress and the world what 
his pen had prepared for their use, and with the importance of this legacy, I am deeply impressed. 
</p><p>
With great respect and friendship,
