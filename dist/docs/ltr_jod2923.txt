I WISH I could know whether your season is cold or warm, wet or dry, fruitful or barren ; whether you 
had late frosts, whether those frosts have hurt the fruit, the flax, the corn or vines, &c. We have a fine season here and a bright prospect of abundance.

You will see, by the enclosed papers in a letter from my friend Parsons, a very handsome narration of 
one of the prettiest exploits of this war, a fine retaliation of the Danbury mischief. Meigs, who was be 
fore esteemed a good officer, has acquired, by this expedition, a splendid reputation. You will see, by the 
same papers, too, that the writers here in opposition to the constitution of Pennsylvania are making factious use of my name and lucubrations ; much against my will, 
I assure you, for although lam no admirer of the form of this government, yet I think it is agreeable to the body 
of the people, and if they please themselves, they will please me. And I would not choose to be impressed 
into the service of one party or the other, and I am determined I will not enlist. Besides, it is not very genteel in these writers to put my name to a letter I 
from which I cautiously withheld if myself. However, let them take their own way, I shall not trouble myself about it.

I am growing better by exercise and air.
