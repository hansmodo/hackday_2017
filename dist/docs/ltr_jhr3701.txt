Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I heartily congratulate your Excellency on the 
powerful aid which you have received from his Most 
Christian Majesty ; and, I doubt not, that the combined forces, under your command, will soon compel 
Lord Cornwallis to surrender himself and his whole 
army prisoners. Indeed, it seems almost impossible 
that they should escape. 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency about the 6th ultimo, by 
Colonel Morris, soliciting such aid as might be necessary for the recovery of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, as soon as New 
York should fall. This I did upon a presumption 
that your first attempt would be against that garrison. 
However, the season was so far advanced before Count 
de Grasse's arrival, that I apprehend, considering how 
much time the operations in Virginia must necessarily 
consume, that the attack upon <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> must be 
postponed for this year. 
</p><p>
No man can be more fully persuaded than myself of your Excellency's unremitted attention to each 
of the United States (how distant soever from you), 
and of your earnest desire to rescue every part of 
them from the enemy. I should not, therefore, offer 
to intrude upon you, when every moment of your 
time must be engaged in matters of the utmost importance, was it not from a fear (which I hope is 
groundless, and proceeding only from my anxiety for 
the country) that the French forces will be desirous 
of returning to the West Indies, when their present 
immediate object is accomplished. Should this be 
their intention, I must entreat your Excellency to endeavour to dissuade them, by the most powerful arguments, from such a measure. A siege of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, 
by the force now in Virginia, cannot fail to succeed 
in three or four weeks. While such a French fleet 
as the present is on our coast, the British fleet will 
not leave <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>; and while they remain there, 
the French have nothing to fear on account of the 
West India Islands. The recovery of the Southern 
States would probably occasion an immediate offer to 
America of the acknowledgment of her independence, 
and of an acceptable peace. 
</p><p>
On the contrary, at this juncture, when the hopes 
and expectations of our friends in the southernmost States are raised to the greatest height and our enemies here, both foreign and domestic, are struck with 
the utmost terror, and justly think every thing on 
the brink of being irrecoverably lost, a desertion of 
these States, by the force of our ally, would produce 
the worst of consequences. Many people, seeing no 
reason for such unaccountable conduct, the very reverse of what they have been led by authority to 
expect, will immediately begin to despond, and be 
induced to believe the report which, though groundless, is constantly circulated by the enemy, that these 
States will be given up to Great Britain, if the independence of the rest can be obtained. The spirits of 
the disaffected wall be revived. The inhabitants of 
the country [will continue] in a miserable condition, 
destitute of every necessary supply, not having, 
while the enemy are possessed of our seaports, and 
command our inlets, the means of procuring them ; 
and certainly, while they hold what they now have 
in these three States (though they should not be 
able to increase their possessions, which however 
they might if reenforced, as without doubt they 
would be), they will not incline to admit our independence, nor, on the other hand, will Congress give 
it up, though the war will be protracted, until these 
countries are totally recovered. But, if that event is 
not now effected, who can say when it will be, or 
when a period so favorable as the present will again 
offer ? 
</p><p>
These, and all other reasons, which may be adduced 
to influence the French Commanders to assist in an 
attack upon <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, will, I am persuaded, have 
already occurred to your Excellency. I have, therefore, only to repeat my most earnest request, that 
you will prevail upon the principal officers of our 
ally not to suffer so glorious an opportunity that now 
presents itself to slip, without laying hold of what is 
almost within their reach ; and offer my most fervent 
wishes, that all your undertakings may he crowned 
with success. I have the honor to he, with the greatest esteem and respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
