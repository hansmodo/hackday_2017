On Tuesday morning last, I commenced type sticking in the Times office. Not having done anything of the kind for a long time, I feared that it would go rather awkwardly, but such was not the case, for I soon found my hands in and could set type as well as ever I could. I boarded myself on bread, cheese, and milk at a cost of $1.50 per day, and at night stretched out my blankets and slept on the floor of the office, where during the first night I scarcely got any sleep on account of the noise the rats made, and not only on account of the noise, but once or twice they ran over my face. On the second night I was very sleepy and although they kept up a great clatter, it did not disturb me and since then I have not minded them.

The foreman gave me ten dollars last evening, at the same time telling me I could get nothing from the editor because he was lying in the sanctum, drunk. Wages here are fifty dollars per week, and I now have some prospect of receiving steady employment as they have purchased a new press and materials and contemplate enlarging their sheet in a short time.

I walked out to where our companions were encamped
and found that Atkins had been able to continue at work only two days, and then only as half a hand, receiving six dollars for his services.
