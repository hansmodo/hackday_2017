MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
BY this day's post I have your letter of the 26th ultimo. I believe that some incomprehensible sympathy 
or other, made me low-spirited all the time you were 
sick, though I neither knew nor suspected it. I rejoice to be informed of your recovery. If I were 
not afraid of every change in your situation that 
might endanger your health, I would plan a project 
for next winter ; but I must leave that for a tete d 
tete. 
</p><p>
To a heart that loves praise so well, and receives 
so little of it, your letter is like laudanum, which <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='colleague'>Mr. Henry</a> the senator, says, is the Divinity itself. 
</p><p>
The French Convention has passed a number of 
resolutions for the regulation of Jacobinical clubs or 
self-created societies, founded in eternal reason, 
perpetual policy and perfect justice, which every 
other nation must adopt or be overthrown. I wish 
Mr. O. and every other minister would preach a sermon, once a quarter, expressly on that text. Affiliations, combinations, correspondences, corporate acts 
of such societies must be prohibited. A snake with 
one head at each end, crawling opposite ways, must 
split the snake in two, unless one head is so much 
stronger than the other as to drag it along over 
thorns and stones till it loses its headship. So the 
King of France's constitution acted. A man drawn 
between two horses is a neat image of a nation drawn 
between its government and self-created societies acting as corporations and combining together. 
</p><p>
Hay for the horses I know you must purchase, and 
I always expected it. Buy the best and enough of it. 
The weather is here this day as fine as you describe 
the day before Christmas, when our friends were so 
good as to visit you, bright, clear, mild ; farmers 
ploughing every where. Letters from Connecticut 
say the cankerworm millers, and slugs, are going up 
the apple trees. Tar our trees in the garden and see 
if you catch any. 
</p><p>
There is an unusual calm and dearth of news at 
present. Most important events are expected to be 
imported by the first vessels. I am myself much inclined to doubt whether the French will get to <a href='/results.php?city=amsterdam' rel='city'>Amsterdam</a>. There are obstacles in their way very 
serious and which may be made invincible. <a href='/results.php?city=amsterdam' rel='city'>Amsterdam</a> may be defended by an inundation. Even with 
out an inundation, it is capable of a good defence. 
A strong wall, a wide, deep ditch, a numerous artillery, and I am not willing to believe that the people 
are asleep or will be idle. I am, with the tenderest 
of all sentiments, 
</p><p>
Ever yours, 
</p><p>
