DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
It is a long time since I had the Pleasure of hearing from 
you directly. M rs . Franklin has indeed now and then acquainted me of your Welfare, which I am always glad to hear 
of. It is, I fear, partly, if not altogether, my Fault that our 
Correspondence has not been regularly continued. One 
thing only I am sure of; that it has been from no want of 
Regard on either side, but rather from too much Business and 
Avocations of various kinds, and my having little of Importance to communicate. 
</p><p>
One of our good Citizens, M r Hillegas, anxious for the 
future Safety of our Town, wrote to me some time since, 
desiring I would enquire concerning the Covering of Houses 
here with Copper. I sent him the best Information I could 
then obtain; but have since received the enclos'd from an 
ingenious friend, M r Wooller, who is what they call here a Civil 
Engineer. I should be glad you would peruse it, think of 
the matter a little, and give me your Sentiments of it. When 
you have done with the Paper, please to give it to M r Hillegas. 
I am told by Lord Despencer, who has covered a long Piazza 
or Gallery with Copper, that the Expence is charged in this 
Account too high; for his cost but i/io per foot, all Charges 
included. I suppose his Copper must have been thinner. 
And indeed it is so strong a Metal, that I think it may well 
be used very thin. 
</p><p>
It appears to me of great Importance to build our DwellingHouses, if we can, in a Manner more secure from Danger 
by Fire. We scarce ever hear of a Fire in Paris. When I 
was there, I took particular Notice of the Construction of 
their Houses ; and I did not see how one of them could well 
be burnt. The Roofs are Slate or Tile ; the Walls are Stone ; 
the Rooms generally lin'd with Stucco or Plaister instead of 
Wainscot ; the Floors of Stucco, or of sixsquare Tiles painted 
brown; or of Flag Stone, or Marble; if any Floor were of 
Wood, it was Oak Wood, which is not so inflammable as 
Pine. Carpets prevent the Coldness of Stone or Brick Floors 
offending the Feet in Winter, and the Noise of Treading on 
such Floors overhead, is less inconvenient than on Boards. 
</p><p>
The Stairs too, at Paris, are either Stone or Brick with only 
a Wooden Edge or Corner for the Step ; so that on the Whole, 
tho' the Parisians commonly burn Wood in their Chimneys, 
a more dangerous kind of Fuel than that used here, yet 
their Houses escape extreamly well, as there is little in a 
Room that can be consumed by Fire, except the Furniture. 
Whereas in London, perhaps scarce a Year passes in which 
half a Million of Property and many Lives are not lost by this 
destructive Element. Of late indeed they begin here to leave 
off Wainscotting their Rooms, and instead of it cover the Walls 
with Stucco, often form'd into Pannels like Wainscot, which, 
being painted, is very strong and warm: Stone Staircases 
too, with Iron Rails, grow more and more into Fashion here : 
But Stone Steps cannot in some Circumstances, be fixed; 
and there methinks Oak is safer than Pine ; and I assure you 
that in many genteel Houses here, both old & new, the Stairs 
and Floors are Oak, and look extreamly well. Perhaps solid 
Oak for the Steps would be still safer than Boards ; and two 
Steps might be cut diagonally out of one Piece. 
</p><p>
Excuse my talking to you on a Subject with which you 
must be so much better acquainted than I am. It is partly 
to make out a Letter for renewing our Correspondence, and 
partly in hope that by turning your Attention to the Point, 
some Methods of greater Security in our future Building may 
be thought of & promoted by you, whose Judgment I know 
has deservedly great Weight with our Fellow- Citizens. For 
tho' our Town has not hitherto suffered very greatly by Fire, 
yet I am apprehensive, that some time or other, by a Concurrence of unlucky Circumstances, such as dry Weather, 
hard Frost, & high Winds, a Fire then happening may 
suddenly spread far and wide over our Cedar Roofs, and 
do us immense Mischief. If you favour me with a Line, 
let me know how good M Rhoads does, and every one of 
your Children; and how it fares with my dear old Friend 
M rs Paschal. With sincere Esteem, I am 
</p><p>
Yours most affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN
