There is no word in the English language that can 
express the state in which we are, and have been, 
these last three days. Day before yesterday, news 
came early in the morning of three of the enemy's 
boats passing the Forts, and then the excitement 
began. It increased rapidly on hearing of the sinking of eight of our gunboats in the engagement, the 
capture of the Forts, and last night, of the burning 
of the wharves and cotton in the city while the 
Yankees were taking possession. To-day, the excitement has reached the point of delirium. I believe I am one of the most self-possessed in my small 
circle; and yet I feel such a craving for news of 
Miriam, and mother, and Jimmy, who are in the 
city, that I suppose I am as wild as the rest. It is 
nonsense to tell me I am cool, with all these patriotic and enthusiastic sentiments. Nothing can be 
positively ascertained, save that our gunboats are 
sunk, and theirs are coming up to the city. Every 
thing else has been contradicted until we really 
do not know whether the city has been taken or 
not. We only know we had best be prepared for 
anything. So day before yesterday, Lilly and I 
sewed up our jewelry, which may be of use if we 
have to fly. I vow I will not move one step, unless 
carried away. Come what will, here I remain.

We went this morning to see the cotton burning 
a sight never before witnessed, and probably never 
again to be seen. Wagons, drays, everything 
that can be driven or rolled, were loaded with 
the bales and taken a few squares back to burn on 
the commons. Negroes were running around, cut 
ting them open, piling them up, and setting them 
afire. All were as busy as though their salvation 
depended on disappointing the Yankees. Later, 
Charlie sent for us to come to the river and see him 
fire a flatboat loaded with the precious material 
for which the Yankees are risking their bodies and 
souls. Up and down the levee, as far as we could see, 
negroes were rolling it down to the brink of the river 
where they would set them afire and push the bales 
in to float burning down the tide. Each sent up 
its wreath of smoke and looked like a tiny steamer 
puffing away. Only I doubt that from the source 
to the mouth of the river there are as many boats 
afloat on the Mississippi. The flatboat was piled 
with as many bales as it could hold without sinking. 
Most of them were cut open, while negroes staved 
in the heads of barrels of alcohol, whiskey, etc., and 
dashed bucketsful over the cotton. Others built up 
little chimneys of pine every few feet, lined with 
pine knots ;and loose cotton, to burn more quickly. 
There, piled the length of the whole levee, or burning in the river, lay the work of thousands of negroes 
for more than a year past. It had come from every 
side. Men stood by who owned the cotton that was 
burning or waiting to burn. They either helped, or 
looked on cheerfully. Charlie owned but sixteen 
bales a matter of some fifteen hundred dollars ; 
but he was the head man of the whole affair, and 
burned his own, as well as the property of others. 
A single barrel of whiskey that was thrown on the 
cotton, cost the man who gave it one hundred and 
twenty-five dollars. (It shows what a nation in ear 
nest is capable of doing.) Only two men got on the 
flatboat with Charlie when it was ready. It was 
towed to the middle of the river, set afire in every 
place, and then they jumped into a little skiff 
fastened in front, and rowed to land. The cotton 
floated down the Mississippi one sheet of living 
flame, even in the sunlight. It would have been 
grand at night. But then we will have fun watching 
it this evening anyway ; for they cannot get through 
to-day, though no time is to be lost. Hundreds of 
bales remained untouched. An incredible amount of 
property has been destroyed to-day; but no one be 
grudges it. Every grog-shop has been emptied, and 
gutters and pavements are floating with liquors of 
all kinds. So that if the Yankees are fond of strong 
drink, they will fare ill.

Yesterday, Mr. Hutchinson and a Dr. Moffat 
called to ask for me, with a message about Jimmy. 
I was absent, but they saw Lilly. Jimmy, they said, 
was safe. Though sick in bed, he had sprung up and 
had rushed to the wharf at the first tap of the alarm 
bell in <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>. But as nothing could be done, 
he would probably be with us to-day, bringing 
mother and Miriam. I have neither heard nor seen 
more. The McRae, they said, went to the bottom 
with the others. They did not know whether any 
one aboard had escaped. God be praised that Jimmy 
was not on her then ! The new boat to which he was 
appointed is not yet finished. So he is saved! I am 
distressed about Captain Huger, and could not refrain from crying, he was so good to Jimmy. But 
I remembered Miss Cammack might think it rather 
tender and obtrusive, so I dried my eyes and began to 
hope he had escaped. Oh! how glad I should be to 
know he has suffered no harm. Mr. Hutchinson was 
on his way above, going to join others where the 
final battle is to be fought on the Mississippi. He 
had not even time to sit down ; so I was doubly grateful to him for his kindness. I wish I could have 
thanked him for being so considerate of me in my 
distress now. In her agitation, Lilly gave him a 
letter I had been writing to George when I was 
called away ; and begged him to address it and mail 
it at <a href='/results.php?city=vicksburg' rel='city'>Vicksburg</a>, or somewhere ; for no mail will leave 
here for Norfolk for a long while to come. The odd 
part is, that he does not know George. But he said 
he would gladly take charge of it and remember the 
address, which Lilly told him was <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>. Well! 
if the Yankees get it they will take it for an insane 
scrawl. I wanted to calm his anxiety about us, 
though I was so wildly excited that I could only 
say, " don't mind us ! We are safe. But fight, George ! 
Fight for us!" The repetition was ludicrous. I 
meant so much, too! I only wanted him to under 
stand he could best defend us there. Ah! Mr. Yankee! if you had but your brothers in this world, and 
their lives hanging by a thread, you too might 
write wild letters ! And if you want to know what an 
excited girl can do, just call and let me show you 
the use of a small seven-shooter and a large carving-knife which vibrate between my belt and my pocket, always ready for emergencies.
