The people of the United States have in their own possession the choice between peace, with unparalleled prosperity, and war, with universal calamity. It gives me pain 
to see that there are so many who can be induced to hesitate for such a length of time in making a choice. A war indeed 
at present with Great Britain must be total destruction to the commerce of our country ; for there is no maritime power 
on earth that can contend with the existing naval British force. This fact is so fully ascertained, that for these three 
or four months the French and Dutch fleets have been obliged to shelter themselves in their respective ports, and 
in every part of the European ocean their enemy has held undisputed possession. How far an American merchant 
under these circumstances can be prepared for war, or willing to support measures that must lead to it, I cannot readily conjecture. 
</p><p>
It is far from my wish that the proceedings of the British government towards the United States and their citizens 
should be forgotten. If resentment were a good or a safe foundation for political measures, few Americans perhaps 
would be disposed to go further than I should. But of all the guides that a nation can follow, passion is the most 
treacherous, and prudence the most faithful. If our countrymen can be sufficiently impressed with this truth, I believe no great length of time will pass, before they will see our national injuries avenged, with a severity which will 
gratify the most inveterate enmity. . . .
