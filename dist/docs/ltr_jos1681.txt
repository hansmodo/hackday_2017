Dear Brother : I have read the enclosed letter with 
a good deal of interest. The feeling of the writer is 
manly and proper. A man may lose his cause both in 
law or in war without yielding his sense of right or his 
pride or honor. If he will only submit to the decision 
of the tribunal to which he appeals, it is all that can 
be asked of him. I meet a great many from the South 
whom I knew before the war, and I confess I am gratified with their sentiments and conduct. If they could 
now see their manifest interests to accept the recent 
adjustment or amendments to the Constitution as a reasonable and fair settlement, the South would soon be 
resurrected into greater wealth and power. I only fear 
their political alliance with the pestilent Copperheads 
of the North, and thus perpetuation of sectional enmity. 
I really fear that Johnson, who is an honest man, will 
from sheer stubbornness and bitter dislike to Stevens and 
a few others, lend himself to this faction. The very 
moment the South will agree to a firm basis of representation, I am for general amnesty and a repeal of the 
test oaths. But the signs of the times indicate another 
stirring political contest. I see no way to avoid it. I 
will have to take part in it, but you can, and I hope will, 
stand aloof. Don't commit yourself to any political 
faction, and don't fail to remember that the Republican, 
or anti-slavery and now anti-rebel feeling, is deeper and 
stronger than any other in the Northern States. We 
could surely contend with a manly, fighting rebel like 
your friend, but never will with those who raised the 
white flag in the rear. . . .

Affectionately,
