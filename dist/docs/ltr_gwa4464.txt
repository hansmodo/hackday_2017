My dear Marquis, 
</p><p>
The freedom of your communications is an evidence 
to me of the sincerity of your attachment ; and every 
fresh instance of this gives pleasure and adds strength 
to the bond, which unites us in friendship. In this 
light I view the intimation respecting the conduct of 
Mr. Lund Washington. Some days previous to the receipt of your letter, which only came to my hands yesterday, I received an account of this transaction from 
that gentleman himself, and immediately wrote and forwarded the answer, of which the enclosed is a copy. 
This letter, which was written in the moment of my 
obtaining the first intimation of the matter, may be considered as a testimony of my disapprobation of his 
conduct, and the transmission of it to you, as a proof of my friendship ; because I wish you to be assured, 
that no man can condemn the measure more sincerely than I do. 
</p><p>
A false idea, arising from the consideration of his being my steward, and in that character more the trustee 
and guardian of my property than the representative 
of my honor, has misled his judgment and plunged him 
into error, upon the appearance of desertion among my 
negroes, and danger to my buildings ; for sure I am, 
that no man is more firmly opposed to the enemy than 
he is. From a thorough conviction of this, and of his integrity, I entrusted every species of my property to 
his care, without reservation or fear of his abusing it. 
The last paragraph of my letter to him was occasioned 
by an expression of his fear, that all the estates convenient to the river would be stripped of their negroes 
and movable property. 
</p><p>
I am very happy to find, that desertion had ceased, 
and content had taken place, in the detachment you 
command. Before this letter can reach you, you 
must have taken your ultimate resolution upon the 
proposal contained in my letters of the 21st and 22d 
ultimo, and have made the consequent arrangements. 
I shall be silent, therefore, on the subject of them ; and 
only beg, in case you should not return to this army, 
and the papers were not lost with your other baggage 
(on which event give me leave to express my concern), 
that you would permit Mr. Capitaine to furnish me 
with copies of the drafts, and the remarks of the pilots 
(taken at Colonel Dey's) on the entrance of the harbour of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. It is possible they may be wanted ; and I am not able to furnish them without your 
assistance. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Washington, and the rest of my small family, 
which at present consists only of Tilghman and Humphreys, join me in cordial salutations ; and, with sentiments of the purest esteem and most affectionate regard, I remain, my dear Marquis, &lc. 
</p>
