Here we are still, in spite of our expectations. 
Difficulty on difficulty arose, and an hour before the 
cars came, it was settled that mother should go to 
<a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> and make the necessary arrangements, and 
leave us to follow in a day or two. Two days more ! 
Miriam no more objected than I did, so mother went 
alone. Poor Miriam went to bed soon after, very ill. 
So ill that she lay groaning in bed at dusk, when a 
stir was heard in the hall below, and Colonel Steadman, Major Spratley, and Mr. Dupr were announced. Presto! up she sprang, and flew about in 
the most frantic style, emptying the trunk on the 
floor to get her prettiest dress, and acting as though 
she had never heard of pains and groans. When we 
leave, how much I shall miss the fun of seeing her 
and Anna running over each other in their excitement of dressing for their favorites. Anna's first 
exclamation was, "Ain't you glad you didn't go!" 
and certainly we were not sorry, from mere compassion; for what would she have done with all three? 
If I laughed at their extra touches to their dresses, 
it did not prevent me from bestowing unusual attention on my own. And by way of bravado, when I 
was carried down, I insisted on Mrs. Badger lending 
me her arm, to let me walk into the parlor and prove 
to Colonel Steadman that in spite of his prophecies 
I was able to take a few steps at least.

His last words, "You won't go, will you? Think 
once more!" sent me upstairs wondering, thinking, 
undecided, and unsatisfied, hardly knowing what to 
do, or what to say. Every time I tried to sleep, 
those calm, deep, honest gray eyes started up before 
my closed ones, and that earnest "You won't go, will 
you? Think once more!" rang in my ears like a solemn warning. Hopes of seeing Georgia grew rather 
faint, that night. Is it lawful to risk my life? But 
is it not better to lose it while believing that I have 
still a chance of saving it by going, than to await certain death calmly and unresisting in <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>? I d 
rather die struggling for this life, this beautiful, 
loved, blessed life that^God has given me!
