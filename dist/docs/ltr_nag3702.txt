Sir, 
</p><p>
The more I have thought upon the subject of explaining the reasons and causes of our movements to 
the army, and through them to the country, the more 
I am confirmed in my opinion of the propriety and 
necessity for it. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency "will consider this is a great movement and has been very rapid; the march of the 
army has been very fatiguing ; the teams of the 
country have been impressed, and every kind of property laid hold on, to pave the way to a certain 
plan of operations. If it is all relinquished, without 
any explanation, the natural reflections that will arise 
upon the occasion will be, why has the army been 
thus harassed without an object; why have the people 
been dragged from their homes, with their teams, and 
the public subjected to a most enormous expense ; 
and why has the property of the people been laid 
hold on by the hand of power, when there appears 
nothing to warrant these extraordinary measures ? 
</p><p>
Without some explanations we shall not do justice 
to ourselves, nor will your Excellency to your own 
military character. The enterprise was great, the object noble, and the end for which it was undertaken 
appears to have been partly answered, if not fully 
so. To explain the reasons for the movement will 
give the army a high opinion of the confidence you 
have in their spirit and enterprise, and perfectly reconcile them to all the past fatigues, and to those 
which may follow, in regaining our former position. 
It will strike the enemy with the boldness of the design; it will be pleasing to the French army, as a measure calculated to give the most speedy relief; 
it will reconcile the country to all the inconveniences 
they have felt, and prepare their minds for future 
exertions of a similar nature, in full confidence that 
the object is worthy the preparation. 
</p><p>
Though I am no advocate, in common, for giving 
reasons, either to the army or the community, for our 
movements, yet there are cases when substantial advantages can be drawn from it; and when the people's curiosity can be gratified and the public be 
benefited at the same time, I think it will be justifiable to adopt the measure. It is unnecessary to 
gasconade highly upon the occasion; but I think we 
may, with great reason, suppose the enemy's return 
to be in consequence of our movements, and that 
gives us the reputation of having saved our allies 
from an injury, and subjected the enemy to the mortification of having been obliged to relinquish their 
project. 
</p><p>
If the explanation takes place, there will be no inconvenience in our recrossing the river. Without it, 
I think there will; for, both the army and the country will think all is given up, and there will be no 
preparations proportionable to the business in contemplation. Your Excellency may remember that 
Sir Henry Clinton explained his movement up to 
Stony Point last campaign, after <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a> took 
that place. He had not half the reasons for that 
explanation as you have for this. 
</p><p>
I wish your Excellency to determine upon your 
further operations, as soon as possible, as boards and 
teams are impressing, collecting, and coming to camp, 
as fast as possible. If the teams are not likely to 
be wanted immediately, they had better be discharged without loss of time, as it will save a great expense, and free the people from no small inconveniences. 
</p><p>
Colonel Hay has sent down a considerable quantity of hoards to King's Ferry, and more are coming. 
Mr. Clarke, of Danhury, writes me that he has got 
an account of one hundred thousand feet, which may 
be had, but not without great inconvenience to the 
inhabitants, as they were got to rebuild the houses 
burnt by the enemy last campaign. There is a great 
number of impressed teams at King's Ferry, on the 
other side, which I wish to dismiss, if there is not 
an immediate necessity for them. I am, with great 
respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
