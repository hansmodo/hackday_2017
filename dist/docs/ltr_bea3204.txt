DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I wrote to you the 2 1st instant from <a href='/results.php?city=german flats' rel='city'>German Flats</a>, that, from 
the best intelligence I could procure of the enemy's strength, it was much superior to ours. At the same time I inclosed you a 
copy of the resolutions of a Council of War, and requested you to send me a reinforcement of one thousand light troops. As 
the enemy had made their approaches within two hundred yards of the Fort, I was determined, at all events, to hard a battle 
rather than to suffer the garrison to fall a sacrifice. This morning I marched from the German Flats for this place. The excessively bad roads, and necessary precautions in marching through a thick wood, retarded us so much, that we have but this moment 
reached this place, where I have met with an express, with the inclosed letter from Colonel Gansevoort, acquainting me that the 
enemy had yesterday retired from Fort Schuyler with great precipitation. I am at a loss to judge of their real intentions, whether they have returned home, or retired with a view of engaging 
us on the road. I am inclined to the former, from the accounts of the deserters, and from their leaving their tents and a considerable baggage, which our people have secured. 
</p><p>
I shall immediately detach about nine hundred men, and make a forced march to the Fort, in hopes of coming up with their 
rear, and securing their cannon and heavy baggage. My artillery, tents, &c., &c., I shall leave here. The bateaux, with the 
provisions, follow me. As soon as the security of the post will permit, I will return with as many men as can be spared. As I 
came down in bateaux, I shall be able to make despatch. I have sent an order for the light troops, if you have sent any, to return immediately, and the militia to go home. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
