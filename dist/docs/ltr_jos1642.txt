Dear Brother : Your letter of January 27th from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>, California, announcing your safe arrival at that 
port, was received by us a few days since. You have 
doubtless before this received letters from here, sent by 
way of Panama, at different times. I suppose you will 
get United States papers at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a> West. They will 
keep you advised of all that is of importance in the 
history of the times. The battles of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=zat rel="colleague">General Taylor</a>, 
and particularly the recent one at Buena Vista, have 
induced politicians to bring him forward as a candidate 
for the presidency. Politics are in a state of "hotch 
potch." The question of slavery in the newly conquered 
territory, the relative influences of the North and the 
South, the heroes of this Mexican War, who will demand 
high civil honors, will mingle in the political strife and 
will, in my opinion, break down the old parties and build 
up new ones, divided by different principles and led by 
different men. . . .

We have heard, since I wrote the above, of General 
Scott's brilliant victory at Cerro Gordo, and the particulars of Donahue's battle at the Sacramento. Victory 
seems to follow our arms wherever they go. Nothing 
but a series of victories has sustained the administration 
in prosecuting the war ; for there is no doubt but that a 
large majority of the people consider it an unjust aggression upon a weak republic, excused by false reasons, and 
continued solely for the acquisition of slave territory.

Your old friend, Hull, I understand, is about to volunteer for the war and will probably be elected lieutenant. 
We sent two companies last year from this county. 
Next week another starts on the way, enlisted for the 
West, and there is no doubt that if the Government 
required it, a force of 100,000 men might be had to 
invade Mexico as readily as 10,000. . . . 
</p><p>
Your affectionate brother,
