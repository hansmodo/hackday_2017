DEAR FATHER:
</p><p>
Your letter asking if Mr. Leathers can be passed South, and also
enclosing two extracts from papers is received.
</p><p>
It is entirely out of the question to pass persons South. We have many
Union Men sacrificing their lives now from exposure as well as battle,
in a cause brought about by secession, and it is necessary for the
security of the thousands still exposed that all communication should
be cut off between the two sections.
</p><p>
As to that article in the  Hawk Eye  it gives me no uneasiness
whatever. The Iowa regiment did its duty fully, and my report gives it
full credit. All who were on the battlefield know where General McClernand and myself were, and there is no need of resort to the
public press for our vindication. The other extract gives our loss in
killed and wounded almost exactly correct. Our missing however is only
three or four over one hundred. Recent information received through
deserters shows that the rebel loss from killed, wounded, and missing
reaches about 2500. One thing is certain,--after the battle about one
third of Columbus was used for hospitals and many were removed to
houses in the country. There were also two steamboat loads sent to
Memphis and the largest hotel in the city taken as a hospital. The
city was put in mourning and all business suspended for a day: and the
citizens thrown into the greatest consternation lest they would be
attacked.
</p><p>
I wrote to you two days ago, therefore it is not necessary to write a
long letter.
</p><p>
I believe I told you that Julia had gone to St. Louis. She will pay
you a short visit before returning to Galena.
</p>
ULYSSES.
