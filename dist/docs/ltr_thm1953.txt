My dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=atw" rel="colleague">General Wayne</a> 
</p><p>
The Reverend M r M c Curdy, who has exerted himself in the Defence of his Country in a very Disinterested Manner, wishes to be establisd as 
a Chaplain in a Brigade under your Command and has applied to me for that purpose 
</p><p>
I have the best Opinion of his Zeal and good upright Intentions for our Salvation as a 
people ; free and independent we shall probably be with Respect to the powers of Darkness on 
this Globe and it will not I trust be his Fault if we do not inherit Freedom & Independence of all wicked powers in the Lite to come. 
</p><p>
In a few Words I beg your Interest & Attention for Mr McCurdy and am with much Friend ship. Your aff.
