Dear Morris, 
</p><p>
Your favour of the 1st of February came to hand last 
week. It gives me pleasure to hear you was then at headquarters, especially on business so important and perplexed. 
It is time that inquiries, as well as punishments, should become more frequent. I wish better, or rather more, use 
was made of courts-martial. Why is the inquiry directed 
to be made into the causes to which we are to ascribe the 
loss of fort Montgomery, &c, so long delayed. Had it 
been immediately after that event took place, the river 
would now have been well fortified, and a general at the 
head of the troops in the southern part of the State. 
</p><p>
Pennsylvania, I believe, is sick unto death. It will nevertheless recover, though perhaps not soon. Weak and bad 
constitutions incline to chronical disorders. 
Were I sure that this letter would reach you uninspected, 
I should commit many things to paper worth your knowledge, but which would give you little pleasure or surprise ; 
but as it is uncertain who will be the bearer, they must be 
reserved for the present. God bless you, and give you 
diligence and patience. Where you arc, both are necessary. 
</p><p>
I am your friend, 
</p><p>
