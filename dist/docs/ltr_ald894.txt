MESSRS. EDITORS--I have been here four days and am on the point of leaving for the Upper Sacramento. I have much information to write you at my first leisure. It has been with much difficulty that I have written at all, our labors have been so severe, and it has been done chiefly at our noon halts under the shade of our wagon. The Valley has been much misrepresented by writers with regard to beauty and fertility. I would not exchange a good farm on one of our rich prairies for the whole of it; and instead of the beautiful Italian sky, it is smoky and unserene. The grass is dry and parched, with nothing green but the leaves of the oaks But there is gold in the mountains and opportunities for making money beyond anything I ever saw. The mines for six hundred miles are yielding well, though it is a kind of lottery in finding rich leads. Many are discouraged at not finding it plenty enough to scrape up, and are disgusted and leaving for home; many have been sick, made so by imprudent exposure and living.--New mines are being discovered even up in the Cascade Mountains. I do not regret coming, and shall remain, for I can make something; so can anybody who will work. I hope you have received the other portions of my journal which have all been duly sent Letters and papers I wish directed to me at Sacramento City, as there is a post office here. One word to all: Let no man come here who will not be willing to work steadily. As near as I can learn, a kind of average is about one ounce per day, though I have seen many who have not made more than five to ten dollars, while many have made and are making hundreds--thousands--in a few hours. You may dig a week and do little or nothing, and this discourages many, and they leave disgusted; but all say the wheel will
turn, keep digging. I shall be gone above about a month and in the time will try to give you a true and impartial statement of things as they are without any poetry. The South Bend and Hennepin companies are all in safe, and I have met several old friends who emigrated to Oregon some years before. Our company has separated; most of them gone to the Yuba mines, some to the Sacramento, and so on.
