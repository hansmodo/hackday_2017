<p><i>[Biographers Note:It was thought best at this time to send General Lee to take command
of military operations in West Virginia.  The ordinary difficulties
of a campaign in this country of mountains and bad roads were greatly
increased by incessant rains, sickness of all kinds amongst the new
troops, and the hostility of many of the inhabitants of the Southern
cause.  My father's letters, which I will give here, tell of his trials
and troubles, and describe at the same time the beauty of the scenery
and some of the military movements.

About August 1st he started for his new command, and he writes to my
mother on his arrival at Huntersville, Pocahontas County, now West
Virginia:]</i>

I reached here yesterday, dearest Mary, to visit this portion of the
army.  The day after my arrival at Staunton, I set off for Monterey,
where the army of General Garnett's command is stationed.  Two regiments
and a field-battery occupy the Alleghany Mountains in advance, about
thirty miles, and this division guards the road to Staunton.  The
division here guards the road leading to the Warm Springs to Milboro
and Covington.  Two regiments are advanced about twenty-eight miles
to Middle Mountain.  Fitzhugh [Major W. H. F. Lee--General Lee's second
son] with his squadron is between that point and this.  I have not seen
him.  I understand he is well.  South of here again is another column
of our enemies, making their way up the Kanawha Valley, and, from
General Wise's report, are not far from Lewisburgh.  Their object seems
to be to get possession of the Virginia Central Railroad and the
Virginia and Tennessee Railroad.  By the first they can approach
Richmond; by the last interrupt our reinforcements from the South.
The points from which we can be attacked are numerous, and their means
are unlimited.  So we must always be on the alert.  My uneasiness on
these points brought me out here.  It is so difficult to get our
people, unaccustomed to the necessities of war, to comprehend and
promptly execute the measures required for the occasion.  General
Jackson of Georgia commands on the Monterey line, General Loring on
this line, and General Wise, supported by General Floyd, on the Kanawha
line.  The soldiers everywhere are sick.  The measles are prevalent
throughout the whole army, and you know that disease leaves unpleasant
results, attacks on the lungs, typhoid, etc., especially in camp, where
accommodations for the sick are poor. I travelled from Staunton on
horseback.  A part of the road, as far as Buffalo Gap, I passed over
in the summer of 1840, on my return to St. Louis, after bringing you
home.  If any one had then told me that the next time I travelled
that road would have been on my present errand, I should have supposed
him insane.  I enjoyed the mountains, as I rode along.  The views are
magnificent--the valleys so beautiful, the scenery so peaceful.
What a glorious world Almighty God has given us.  How thankless and
ungrateful we are, and how we labour to mar his gifts.  I hope you
received my letters from Richmond.  Give love to daughter and Mildred.
I did not see Rob as I passed through Charlottesville.  He was at
the University and I could not stop.
