MY DEAR PORTIA. [<a href='/results.php?year=1780' rel="origin">1780</a>]
</p><p>
THE enclosed dialogue in the shades was written by 
Mr. Edmund Jennings, now residing at Brussels, a 
native of Maryland. I will send you the rest when 
I can get it. How I lament the loss of my packets 
by Austin! There were, I suppose, letters from 
</p><p> 
Congress of great importance to me. I know not 
what I shall do without them. I suppose there was 
authority to draw, etc. Mr. T.'s letter from his 
father hints that Mr. L. is coming here. This will be 
excellent.

Since my arrival this time, I have driven about 
Paris more than I did before. The rural scenes 
around this town are charming. The public walks, 
gardens, &c., are extremely beautiful. The gardens 
of the Palais Royal and the gardens of the Tuileries are 
very fine. The Place de Louis XV., the Place Vendome or Place de Louis XIV., the Place Victoire, the 
Place Royale, are fine squares, ornamented with very 
magnificent statues. I wish I had time to describe 
these objects to you, in a manner that I should have 
done twenty-five years ago, but my head is too full 
of schemes, and my heart of anxiety, to use expres 
sions borrowed from you know whom. To take a 
walk in the gardens of the palace of the Tuileries, 
and describe the statues there, all in marble, in which 
the ancient divinities and heroes are represented with 
exquisite art, would be a very pleasant amusement and 
instructive entertainment, improving in history, mythology, poetry, as well as in statuary. Another 
walk in the gardens of Versailles would be useful 
and agreeable. But to observe these objects with 
taste and describe them, so as to be understood, would 
require more time and thought than I can possibly 
spare. It is not indeed the fine arts which our 
country requires ; the useful, the mechanic arts, are 
those which we have occasion for in a young country 
, as yet simple and not far advanced in luxury, 
although perhaps much too far for her age and 
character. I could fill volumes with descriptions of 
temples and palaces, paintings, sculptures, tapestry, 
porcelain, &c., &c., &c., if I could have time ; but I 
could not do this without neglecting my duty. The 
science of government, it is my duty to study, more 
than all other sciences ; the arts of legislation and 
administration and negotiation, ought to take place of, 
indeed to exclude, in a manner, all other arts. I must 
study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. My sons 
ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history and naval architecture, navigation, 
commerce and agriculture, in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and porcelain.
