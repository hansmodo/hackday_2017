My Lord, 
</p><p>
When I had the honor of an interview with your Grace at 
Whitehall, on Monday, the twenty-ninth of last month, I left, at 
your request, a letter from the President of the United States 
to me, which you promised to return after you should have had 
it copied. As your Grace seemed to be particularly pleased 
with the contents of that letter, I took the liberty to request 
that I might be speedily honored with the communication of 
your sentiments on the subjects of it. This you were so kind 
as to promise. Your subsequent silence led me to apprehend, 
that this affair might have been overlooked in the attention to 
matters of more apparent moment. I took the liberty there 
fore to recall it to your Grace's recollection by a note of the 
nineteenth instant, which was delivered at Whitehall, and to 
which no reply has been received. 
</p><p>
Permit me now, my Lord, to request that the President's 
letter may be returned, and excuse me for expressing at the 
same time a wish, that you would enable me to transmit the 
evidence of those friendly dispositions towards America, which 
you were pleased to express. It flows from the sincere desire 
that more perfect harmony may be established between the 
two countries, and a solicitude to obviate unpleasant circumstances. I have the honor to be, &c.
