Report No. 40. 
<p></p>
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,

MEXICO, December 17, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a>.

SIR: 
<p></p>
The troop of Louisiana horse, under Captain Fair-child, that so handsomely escorted up from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a> 
Mr. Doyle, the British Charge d Affaires, being about 
to return to its station, I avail myself of the opportunity to write to the department. 
<p></p>
I invite attention to my order, No. 376, and particularly to its seventh paragraph import and export 
duties. Since its publication, I have seen in a slip, 
cut from a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a> newspaper (received here by a 
merchant), what purports to be a letter, dated the 17th 
ultimo, from the department to me on the same subject. 
<p></p>
Major - General Butler s and Lieutenant - Colonel 
Johnston's columns will he here to-day, to-morrow, 
and the next day ; and in a week I propose to despatch 
one column to San Luis de Potosi. When, or whether, 
I shall have a sufficient independent force for Zacatecas, is yet, to me, quite uncertain. The San Luis coltunn, with a view to Tampico, and in part to Zacate 
cas, is the more important, and may be enlarged to, 
perhaps, seven thousand men. 
<p></p>
The following distances from the Mexican official 
itineraries may be useful : From the capital to Queretaro, is 57 leagues, or 142 miles ; thence to Zacatecas, 
282 miles the two distances making 424. From the 
capital to San Luis, is 113 leagues, or 382 miles (Queretaro may be avoided), and, in continuance by that 
route, 260 miles to Tampico, or 134 to Zacatecas. 
Thus, from Mexico, via San Luis, to Tampico, is 642 
miles, and to Zacatecas, 516 ; whereas, the distance 
from Zacatecas to Tampico is but 398. Zacatecas, 
therefore, may be advantageously reached, or its trade 
opened with Tampico, via San Luis. The difficulty is, 
to occupy the state capitals of Guanajuato, etc., with 
out passing through and including Queretaro, the temporary capital of the Federal Government ; and 1 am 
reluctant to disturb that Government whilst it continues intent on a peace with us, without further 
knowledge of the views at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a> on the subject. 
That information I hope soon to receive ; and, if in 
favor of covering the country, to hear of the approach 
of reinforcements behind the column of Brigadier-General Marshall, now I suppose, as far advanced as 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a>. 
<p></p>
I have the honor to be, etc., etc.,
