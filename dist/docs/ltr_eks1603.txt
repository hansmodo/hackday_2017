" There is no end to human calamity! " 111 luck has 
pursued me every step from Chicago, where I arrived 
Saturday, the twenty-ninth ultimo. I was there encouraged with the idea that I should reach <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=St. Louis" rel="city">St. Louis</a> 
by the night of the first, and to ensure it I engaged 
an extra in company with some other gentlemen, pay 
ing double fare to Peru where we expected to meet a 
boat. We were to reach that place in fourteen hours. 
We started at four in the afternoon and at daylight 
next morning were only thirty- six miles from Chicago, 
and did not arrive at our destination until night when 
we found the Illinois very low and no boat. By our 
contract we were to have been sent forward in the 
mail stage, but it passed in the night, full, and we lost 
our chance. In the morning we took another extra 
to Peoria seventy miles with an express engage 
ment to overtake the mail at that point, or to be sent 
on immediately. We arrived at Peoria in good time 
but the agent for the line utterly refused to fulfil the 
contract and we were detained twenty-four hours, 
neither threats nor bribes being of any avail. My 
fellow sufferers were Judge B , the M. C. from

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=St. Louis" rel="city">St. Louis</a> and his wife, a lovely lady, a Dr. L 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=St. Louis" rel="city">St. Louis</a> and a Mr. H - and his sister from 
Lysander. We finally got off in the mail stage 
Tuesday night and thought our detentions were over. 
We were to reach Alton at eight and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=St. Louis" rel="city">St. Louis</a> by 
ten in the morning. It rained violently, the roads 
were heavy and it was after twelve at noon when we 
drove down the hill into Alton. The packet was gone 
and we were detained until this morning, when I suc 
ceeded in getting on board a light draught Ohio River 
boat which I shall leave at Cairo where I hope to 
overtake the " Tempest," a fast down-river boat. I 
have been so much delayed that I fear I cannot 
reach my regiment til after my leave has expired. I 
shall be much mortified and distressed should there 
be an engagement before I join and after the expira 
tion of my leave. A fight seems certain as the Mexicans are concentrating a strong force at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Monterey" rel="city">Monterey</a>, 
and although Paredes is dethroned I think it will not 
alter the relations between the two Governments. 
Santa Anna may prove our bitterest foe. I find 
whenever I meet an officer that dissatisfaction with 
the brevets, and total disgust at the whole course of 
the Administration is felt by a large majority of the 
army. I have determined to keep quiet and simply 
do my duty without looking for distinction. ... As 
I am now on the mighty river, I cannot suffer from 
much more detention and shall hope to overtake the 
Second Infantry at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New Orleans" rel="city">New Orleans</a>. . . .
