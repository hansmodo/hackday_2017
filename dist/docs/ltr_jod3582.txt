MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
CHEESEMAN has at length arrived, and I have received 
my trunk in much better order than I expected. 
</p><p>
The people here are much cooler than they were 
last week. The embargo begins to be felt by many 
who have been the most noisy and turbulent. Speculation mingles itself in every political operation, and 
many merchants have already made a noble spec of 
the embargo by raising their prices ; but the foolish 
tradesmen and laborers, who were so ready to follow 
the heels of their scheming leaders, are now out of 
employment, and will lose thirty dollars a head by 
this embargo. If they had been taxed half the sum 
to the most necessary and important measure, they 
would have bitterly complained. I can see little benefit in the embargo, except that it may cool down the 
courage of such kind of people. It may be expected 
that we shall soon have a clamor against the renewal 
of it, if not to have it repealed. 
</p><p>
The Assembly of Pennsylvania have this day 
chosen a senator; Mr. James Ross, of Washington 
county, in the place of Mr. Gallatin. 
</p><p>
A violent measure has been proposed in the House, 
to sequester all debts due from American citizens to 
British subjects. Such a motion will do no honor to 
our country. Such laws are injurious to the debtor as 
well as the creditor, for they cannot dissolve the con 
tracts. It will not pass the House, and if it did, it 
would stop in the Senate. 
</p><p>
We are rejoiced that the civic feast in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> succeeded no better. It is astonishing that Mr. A. should ever have thought of implicating the government in 
so indecent and hostile a frolic. We have had an 
incessant struggle all the winter to restrain the internperate ardor of the people out of doors and their too 
accurate representatives in both houses. Too many 
of our good federalists are carried away at times by 
their passions, and the popular torrent, to concur in 
motions arid countenance sentiments inconsistent with 
our neutrality and tending directly to war. But I 
hope we shall be able to make a stand against all 
fatal attempts. 
</p><p>
I long to be at home, but I dare not ask leave to 
go. The times are too critical for any man to quit 
his post without the most urgent necessity. Ways 
and means must be provided to defray the expenses 
incurred, and I expect this will be put off till May. I 
shall be very uneasy through this whole month, but 
I must take patience. I hope <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='me'>Mr. Adams</a>, of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, 
the lawyer, is full of business and making his for 
tune. I hear so seldom from him, that I must sup 
pose him busy. 
</p><p>
Tell my dear mother that I hope to have the plea 
sure of seeing her in the month of May. Love to 
my brothers and sister and cousins, &c. 
</p><p>
I am most tenderly yours, 
</p><p>
