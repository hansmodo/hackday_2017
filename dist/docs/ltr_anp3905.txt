SIR : 
</p><p>
As the situation of this country makes it still necessary that a part of 
the people should constantly be on duty for the purpose of suppressing 
such parties of men, as lost to every sense of justice or principle of 
honesty or humanity, make it their sole study to ruin and distress by every 
means in their power, every man who shews the least attachment to 
honesty, regular order and civil government; and as this service will 
be better performed by men engaged for a certain determinate time, 
than by the militia called out from time to time as exigences may re 
quire, I desire that you will, with all possible expedition, engage arid 
embody twenty-five good men for your own and Captain John Mitchel's 
companies, exclusive of one Lieutenant, one Quarter Master and two 
Sergeants, to serve for six months from the day the whole are engaged 
and reported to me. 
</p><p>
They will serve on horse-back, each man furnishing his own horse, 
saddle, and other accoutrements if he can, but where that is not in his 
power, you will have horses, saddles, &c., provided for such as are in 
want by virtue of the warrant to impress such articles herewith given 
you ; you will be particularly careful to have an exact account kept by 
the Quarter Master of all such horses, saddles, &c., as may be impressed 
by you, specifying the person's name for whom they are got, the time 
when, and the sums to which they are appraised ; all which as well as 
the people's own horses, you will have the greatest care taken of, that 
you may always be in a condition fit for service, and that there may be 
no unnecessary waste of property, you will also take care to make the 
Quarter-Master give receipts for all provision and forage you receive, 
and keep a book in which he is to rate regularly all articles, either 
horses, saddles, provisions, or forage, the two last articles need not be 
appraised, but the quantity and quality exactly ascertained that the 
Legislature may with the more ease fix the prices. 
</p><p>
You will be particularly careful not to distress any of the good citizens of this State under any pretence, as the interest of this company is 
to protect, not to injure ; you will, therefore, effectually stop all plundering, of every kind, as no property is to be meddled with on any pretence whatever, unless such as may be taken in the field from men in 
arms against the State, which is to be the property of the captors, except what may be proved to belong to good citizens, doing or always 
ready to do their duty when called on, who are to have their property 
delivered to them when proved, without any reward or deduction. 
</p><p>
All those who may claim property retaken from the enemy, and who 
have not themselves done their duty when called on, or who have 
refused or neglected the same., or moved into other States, will pay one-third part of the value of all such property, to be ascertained by three 
indifferent men, sworn to appraise the same. 
</p><p>
Your company will be governed by the rules and articles for the 
Government of the troops of this State, and entitled to such pay as is 
allowed by the present militia law, and they will not be called out of 
this District, unless on some particular emergency, and by my particular 
order. 
</p><p>
I am sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
