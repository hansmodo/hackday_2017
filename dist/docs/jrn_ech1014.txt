I have done the last clothes washing I intend to do before getting to the diggings. I borrowed a tub and large kettle of Mrs. Sterling, and the washing went much better with hot fresh water than cold salt.

Atkins and myself have carried one of my trunks to Mr. Griffith's for safe-keeping during our absence. The distance from Happy Valley to Mr. Griffith's is about two miles and we were tired of the task long before we had proceeded half the way.

Saturday was the most unpleasant day we have spent in the valley, the rain pouring down in torrents, wetting everything through and through, and a cold wind blowing during the whole time. It was with the greatest difficulty we could get the fire to burn sufficient to boil our beef, potatoes and chocolate. We bought a pound of chocolate for $1, and one pint of oil for 75 cents. Not deeming our blankets sufficient to take with us, we each bought a pair of double blankets. One of our party, McCowan, who has not been very well for a few days past, is heartily sick of the place and has been wishing himself out of the scrape.

Sunday I rambled up toward the city for the purpose of procuring a paper giving the departure of the several boats for Stockton. The stores and hotels are kept open during the day and evening, and many workmen are busy in the streets as on any other day. After buying a paper for 25 cents, in strolling along the streets, I accidentally halted before the Baptist chapel, and seeing the pews arranged according to home style, I entered and seated myself. It being early and few persons in attendance, I hauled out my paper and read it thoroughly before the congregation assembled. It reminded me more of home than anything I have seen or felt
since leaving West Chester. A good sermon was preached upon the importance of encouraging Sunday Schools. To note the preponderance of the male over the female population in this place I need only mention that in this congregation of at least 250, only three female faces appeared.

We have now packed our things and have everything in readiness to leave for San Joaquin (pronounced San Wakein) in the steamer Mint in the morning, paying $30 passage. We have been here three weeks.
