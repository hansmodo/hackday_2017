DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency's favors of the 26th ultimo and 12th instant. 
Two days before the former came to hand, I received 
the act of Congress respecting the troops proposed to 
be raised for the defence of our frontiers. Some considerable time will necessarily elapse before they can 
be embodied ; and, as the enemy have already appeared at different times and places on the northern and 
western frontiers, I am very apprehensive that, in 
the interim, the more remote settlements will be 
abandoned. Every measure will be used to expedite 
this business, and your Excellency will have the earliest information of the disposition which, in consequence of your letter, I shall cause to be made of 
these levies. 
</p><p>
The act of Congress, of the 26th of last month, respecting the quotas of supplies for the army, to be 
furnished by the different States, was not received 
until some days after the rising of the Legislature. 
This, together with some other important matters 
from Congress, has induced me to call them together 
at an earlier day than that to which they stand adjourned; and I have accordingly issued my proclamation for convening them at <a href='/results.php?city=kingston' rel='city'>Kingston</a> on the 9th of 
next month, when this business will be submitted 
to their consideration. In the mean time, I think it 
my duty to inform your Excellency, that, in consequence of the several laws which have been enacted 
for obtaining supplies of provision and forage for the 
army, this State is so exhausted, that I am persuaded there is not more grain and meal left in possession of the farmers, than a bare competency for the 
support of its inhabitants until the new crop comes 
in ; and with respect to forage, few of the farmers 
have a sufficiency to bring their stock through until 
grass. Should, therefore, the present supplies, besides 
what are already in the hands of the public officers, 
be wanted before harvest, they are not to be had in 
this State. I should have written to your Excellency 
earlier on this subject, but I did not receive your letter until a few days ago. I have the honor to be, 
with the highest sentiments of respect and esteem, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
