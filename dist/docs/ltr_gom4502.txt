Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You have heard, and you will hear, a great deal about politics, and in the heap of chaff you may find some grains of 
good sense. Believe me, Sir, freedom and religion are only watch words. We have appointed a Committee, or rather we 
have nominated one. Let me give you the history of it. It is needless to premise, that the lower orders of mankind are 
more easily led by specious appearances, than those of a more exalted station. This and many similar propositions you 
know better than your humble servant. 
</p><p>
The troubles in America during Grenville's administration 
put our gentry upon this finesse. They stimulated some daring coxcombs to rouse the mob into an attack upon the bounds 
of order and decency. These fellows became the Jack Cades of the day, the leadernrin all riots, the belwethers of the flock. 
The reason of the manoeuvre in those, who wished to keep fair with government, and at the same time to receive the incense 
of popular applause, you will readily perceive. On the whole, the shepherds were not much to blame in a politic point of 
view. The belwethers jingled merrily, and roared out liberty, and property, and religion, and a multitude of cant terms, 
which every one thought he understood, and was egregiously 
mistaken. For you must know the shepherds kept the dictionary of the day, and like the mysteries of the ancient mythology, it was not for profane eyes or ears. This answered 
many purposes ; the simple flock put themselves entirely under the protection of these most excellent shepherds. By and 
bye behold a great metamorphosis, without the help of Ovid or 
his divinities, but entirely effectuated by two modern genii, the 
god of ambition and the goddess of faction. The first of 
these prompted the shepherds to shear some of their flock, 
and then, in conjunction with the other, converted the belwethers into shepherds. That we have been in hot water 
with the British Parliament ever since, every body knows. 
Consequently these new shepherds had their hands full of employment. The old ones kept themselves least in sight, and a 
want of confidence in each other was not the least evil which 
followed. The port of Boston has been shut up. These 
sheep, simple as they are, cannot be gulled as heretofore. In 
short, there is no ruling them ; and now, to leave the metaphor, 
the heads of the mobility grow dangerous to the gentry, and 
how to keep them down is the question^ While they correspond with the other colonies, call and dismiss popular assemblies, make resolves to bind the consciences of the rest of 
mankind, bully poor printers, and exert with full force all their 
other tribunitial powers, it is impossible to curb them. 
</p><p>
But art sometimes goes farther than force, and therefore to 
trick them handsomely a committee of patricians was to be 
nominated, and into their hands was to be committed [he majesty of the people, and the highest trust was to be reposed in 
them by a mandate, that they should take care, quod respublica non capiat injuriam. The tribunes, through want of a 
good legerdemain in the senatorial order, perceived the finesse, and yesterday I was present at a grand division of the 
city, and there I beheld my fellow citizens very accurately 
counting all tru'ir chickens, not only before any of them were 
hatched, but before above one half of the eggs were laid. In 
short, they fairly contended about the future forms of our government, whether it should be founded upon Aristocratic or 
Democratic principles. 
</p><p>
I stood in the balcony, and on my right hand were ranged 
all the people of property, with some few poor dependants, 
and on the other all the tradesmen, &c. who thought it worth 
their while to leave daily labor for the good of the country. The 
spirit of the English Constitution has yet a little influence left, 
and but a little. The remains of it, however, will give the 
wealthy people a superiority this time, but would they secure 
it, they must banish all schoolmaster and confine all knowledge to themselves. This cannot be. The mob begin to 
think and to reason. Poor reptiles ! it is with them a vernal 
morning, they are struggling to cast off their winter's slough, 
they bask in the sunshine, and ere noon they will bite, depend 
upon it. The gentry begin to fear this. Their committee will 
be appointed, they will deceive the people, and again forfeit a 
share of their confidence. And if these instances of what 
with one side is policy, with the other perfidy, shall continue 
to increase, and become more frequent, farewell aristocracy. 
I see, and I see it with fear and trembling, that if the disputes 
with Britain continue, we shall be under the worst of all possible dominions. We shall be under the domination of a riotous mob. 
</p><p>
It is the interest of all men, therefore, to seek for reunion with the parent state. A safe compact seems in my poor 
opinion to be now tendered. Internal taxation to be left with 
ourselves. The right of regulating trade to be vested in Britain, where alone is found the power of protecting it. I trust 
you will agree with me, that this is the only possible mode of union. Men by nature are free as the air. When they enter 
into society, there is, there must be, an implied compact, for there never yet was an express one, that a part of this freedom 
shall be given up for the security of the remainder. But. what part? The answer is plain. The least possible, considering 
the circumstances of the society, which constitute what may be called its political necessity. And what does this political 
necessity require in the present instance ? Not that Britain 
should lay imposts upon us for the support of government, nor 
for its defence. Not that she should regulate our internal police. These things affect us only. She can have no right to 
interfere. To these things we ourselves are competent. But can it be said, that we are competent to the regulating of 
trade ? The position is absurd, for this affects every part of the British Empire, every part of the habitable earth. If 
Great Britain, if Ireland, if America, if all of them, are to make laws of trade, there must be a collision of these different 
authorities, and then who is to decide the v is major ? To recur to this, if possible to be avoided, is the greatest of all great absurdities. 
</p><p>
Political necessity therefore requires, that this power should be placed in the hands of one part of the empire. Is 
it a question which part ? Let me answer by asking another. Pray which part of the empire protects trade ? Which part 
of the empire receives almost immense sums to guard the rest ? And what danger is in the trust ? Some men object, 
that England will draw all the profits of our trade into her 
coffers. All that she can, undoubtedly. But unless a reasonable compensation for his trouble be left to the merchant 
here, she destroys the trade, and then she will receive no profit from it. 
</p><p>
If I remember, in one of those kind letters with which you 
have honored me, you desire my thoughts on matters as they 
rise. How much pleasure I take in complying with your requests let my present letter convince you. If I am faulty in 
telling things, which you know better than I do, you must excuse this fault, and a thousand others for which I can make no 
apology. I am, Sir, &c.
