Palo Alto, California, <br> Sept. 25th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1918">1918</a> [business letterhead of EW Cook, 270 University Ave.] <br><br> Dear Horace, <br> I wrote you some time ago but hope you will not object to another one. Mr. D 
was good enough to let me see his letter today and I enjoyed it with him. Things 
are going about the same at the store my brother is still working and does fairly 
well. We are not very busy this week as it is the last of the month. I have last 
quite a bit of the Runnymead trade since you left. I do not solicit out there 
at all now. Clifford and his mother went back to Kansas and Colo. This summer 
in the Studabaker. They are not home yet but I expect them this week. They did 
not have any trouble going back but coming home they broke a rear axle and had 
to stay in one place over a week. It was at Ft. Steele Wyo. They have been gone 
about 2 ½ months so it has been rather a lonesome summer for me. As Clifford was 
18 the 13th of July he had to register Sept. 12th. He intends too go to Stanford, 
but will have to stay there all the time and be under military discipline the 
same as you. He will have to go to a camp in the spring. I sold 12 boxes of your 
beans this year gave your father $1.50 per box for them. They were very nice but 
ripened up too fast theis year. Would not keep at all like they did last year. 
Your father looks well and seemed to be in good spirits. We had a 51/2 inch rain 
a few days ago and it makes everything green already, and the streets muddy. No 
grading done yet. Lizzie No.2 stands out in front. Clifford got [unintelligible] 
last spring and painted her red. So she looks pretty loud. I am glad to see that 
there is something doing over there since you got over. I think we will have the 
Kaiser where we want him soon. Saw Oscar at the movies the other night by himself. 
He looked lonesome. <br> Well goodbye for today, with the best wishes <br> E.W. Cook
