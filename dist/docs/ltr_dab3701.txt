Dear General, 
</p><p>
The Lieutenant of Monongalia county informs me, 
that ten men were killed on Friday last, above the 
forks of Cheat. They were quite off their guard 
when the Indians attacked them, and made no resistance. The troops are suffering for want of bread, 
the waters being too low to grind the grain; and I 
am informed that the pack-horse men have left the 
service for want of pay, &c. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty to inclose the proceedings of the 
General Court-Martial on the trials of Captain Thomas Beall, Peter Davis, and David Gamble, and shall 
be happy to receive your directions respecting them. 
The General Court-Martial has addressed a letter to 
your Excellency, which is inclosed with the proceedings. I have lately received two letters from the 
Delaware towns, copies of which I likewise take the 
liberty to inclose. It appears by the contents, that 
the Delawares and the Wyandots, and their numerous allies, might be speedily involved in a war 
against each other, provided we were possessed of 
the means to reward the Delawares for bringing in 
Wyandot scalps and prisoners. 
</p><p>
The forts, in the new countiy, were taken by about 
two hundred white men and seven hundred Indians. 
Encouraged by their success, it is highly probable 
they will attempt carrying these garrisons, which, in 
their present circumstances, to superior numbers must 
inevitably fall a prey, unless timely supplies can be 
obtained. But the best exertions in my power shall 
not be wanting to prevent so fatal an event. I have 
the honor to be, with the utmost respect and esteem. 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
