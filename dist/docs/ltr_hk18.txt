Chicago, Ill <br> March 10, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1918">1919</a> <br><br> Horace King Dear Brother <br> I am going to write you in care of the Rocky Mt. club and hope you will get it. 
I would send you a five spot to have a good meal and see a good show if I were 
sure you would get it. I hope you will be able to stop off at Buffalo and see 
the relatives. Julia is teaching at Niagara Falls and you should see the falls. 
I certainly hope you can stop off on your way home. can you not get your discharge 
from New York and the milage to Cal in cash and you can stop when you want. If 
you want any money, telegraph me and I will have the Bank telegraph money to you. 
We would all feel pretty bad if you should pass through here and not be able to 
see you. Sent you a letter and money order to [unintelligible] in care of a friend 
there but fear you may not get it as I have since heard he was to leave there 
for some other camp. We are all well here and anxious to see you. Will take another 
chance and send the five spot. All send love <br><br> Robt
