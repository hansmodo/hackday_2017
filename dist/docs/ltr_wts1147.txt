CAMP BEFORE <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>, Feb. 18, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1863">1863</a>.

My Dear Brother : . . . We have reproached the South 
for arbitrary conduct in coercing their people at last 
we find we must imitate their example. We have denounced their tyranny in filling their armies with conscripts, and now we must follow her example. We have 
denounced their tyranny in suppressing freedom of speech 
and the press, and here too in time we must follow their 
example. The longer it is deferred the worse it becomes; 
^Vho gave notice of McDowell's movement on Manassas, 
and enabled Johnston so to reinforce Beauregard that our 
army was defeated? The press. Who. gave notice of 
the movement on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>? The press. Who has 
prevented all secret combinations and movements against 
our enemy ? The press. . . . 
</p><p>
In the South this/ powerful machine was at once 
scotched and used by the rebel government, but at the 
North was allowed 7 to go .free. What are the results ? 
After arousing the passions of the people till the two 
great sections hate each other with a hate hardly paralleled in history/, it now begins to stir up sedition at 
home, and even^ to encourage mutiny in our armies. 
'What has paralyzed the Army of the Potomac ? Mutual 
jealousies kept alive by the press. What has enabled 
the enemy to combine so as to hold Tennessee after we 
have twice crossed it with victorious armies ? What 
defeats and will continue to defeat our best plans here 
and elsewhere ? The press. 1 1 cannot pick up a paper 
but tells of our situation here, in the mud, sickness, and 
digging a canal in which we have little faith. But our 
officers attempt secretly to cut two other channels one 
into Yazoo by an old pass and one through Lake Providence into Tensas, Black, Red, &c., whereby we ceuld 
turn not only <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a>, Port Hudson, but also Grand 
(Gulf), Natchez, Ellis Cliff, Fort Adams and all the 
strategic points on the main river, and the busy agents 
of the press follow up and proclaim to the world the 
whole thing, and instead of surprising our enemy we 
find him felling trees and blocking passages that would 
without this have been in our possession, and all the real 
effects of surprise are lost. 1 1 say with the press unfettered as now we are defeated to the end of time. 'Tis 
folly to say the people must have news. Every soldier 
can and does write to his family and friends, and all 
have ample opportunities for so doing, and this pretext 
forms no good reason why agents of the press should 
reveal prematurely all our plans and designs. We cannot prevent it. Clerks of steamboats, correspondents in 
disguise or openly attend each army and detachment, 
and presto! appear in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=memphis" rel="city">Memphis</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">ST. Louis</a> minute 
accounts of our plans and designs. These reach <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vicksburg" rel="city">Vicksburg</a> by telegraph from Hernando and Holly Springs 
before we know of it. 'The only two really successful 
military strokes out here have succeeded because of the 
absence of newspapers, or by throwing them off the trail. 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a> had to make a simulated attack on Columbus to 
prevent the press giving notice of his intended move 
against Forts Henry and Donelson. We succeeded in 
reaching the Post of Arkansas before the correspondents 
could reach the papers. 
</p><p>
Affectionately, 
</p><p>
SHERMAN.
