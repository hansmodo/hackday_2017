DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your favour of March 31. It is now with the 
messages &c. in the hands of the minister, so that I cannot 
be more particular at present in answering it than to say, I 
should have a melancholy prospect in going home to such 
public confusion, if I did not leave greater confusion behind 
me. The newspapers, and my letter of this day to Mr. Ross, will inform you of the miserable situation this country 
is in. While I am writing, a great mob of coal porters fills 
the street, carrying a wretch of their business upon poles 
to be ducked, and otherwise punished at their pleasure for 
working at the old wages. All respect to law and government seems to be lost among the common people, who are 
moreover continually inflamed by seditious scribblers, to 
trample on authority and every thing that used to keep them 
in order. 
</p><p>
The Parliament is now sitting, but will not continue long 
together, nor undertake any material business. The court 
of King's Bench postponed giving sentence against Wilkes 
on his outlawry till the next term, intimidated as some say by 
his popularity, and willing to get rid of the affair for a time, 
till it should be seen what the Parliament would conclude 
as to his membership. The Commons at least some of them, 
resent that conduct, which has thrown a burthen on them it 
might have eased them of, by pillorying or punishing him in 
some infamous manner, that would have given better ground 
for expelling him the House. His friends complain of it as a 
delay of justice, say the court knew the outlawry to be defective, and that they must finally pronounce it void, but would 
punish him by long confinement. Great mobs of his adherents have assembled before the prison, the guards have 
fired on them; it is said five or six are killed, and sixteen 
or seventeen wounded; and some circumstances have attended this military execution, such as its being done by the 
Scotch regiment, the pursuing a lad, and killing him at his 
father's house, &c. &c., that exasperate people exceedingly, 
and more mischief seems brewing. Several of the soldiers 
are imprisoned. If they are not hanged, it is feared there 
will be more and greater mobs ; and, if they are, that no soldier 
will assist in suppressing any mob hereafter. The prospect 
either way is gloomy. It is said the English soldiers cannot 
be confided in, to act against these mobs, being suspected as 
rather inclined to favour and join them. 
</p><p>
I am preparing for my return, and hope for the pleasure 
of finding you well, when I shall have an opportunity of communicating to you more particularly the state of things here 
relating to our American affairs, which I cannot so well do 
by letter. I enclose for you a report of Sir M L , counsel to the Board of Trade, on one of your late acts. I 
suppose it has had its effect, so that the repeal will be of 
little consequence. In the mean time, I am with sincere 
esteem and affection, Sir, your most obedient and most 
humble servant, B. FRANKLIN.
