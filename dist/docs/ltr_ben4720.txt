DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
We have had so many alarms of changes, which did not 
take place, that just when I wrote it was thought the ministry 
would stand their ground. However, immediately after, the 
talk was renewed, and it soon appeared that the Sunday 
changes were actually settled. Mr. Con way resigns and Lord 
Weymouth takes his place. Lord Gower is made President 
of the Council in the room of Lord Northington. Lord 
Shelburne is stript of the American business, which is given 
to Lord Hillsborough as secretary of state for America, a 
new distinct department. Lord Sandwich, 'tis said, comes 
into the postoffice in his place. Several of the Bedford 
party are now to come in. 
</p><p>
How these changes may effect us a little time will show. 
Little at present is thought of but elections, which gives me 
hopes that nothing will be done against America this session, 
though the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Gazette had occasioned some heats, and the 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Resolutions a prodigious clamour. I have endeavoured to palliate matters for them as well as I can : I send 
you my manuscript of one paper, though I think you take the 
Chronicle. The editor of that paper, one Jones, seems a 
Grenvillian, or is very cautious, as you will see by his corrections and omissions. He has drawn the teeth and pared the 
nails of my paper, so that it can neither scratch nor bite. It 
seems only to paw and mumble. I send you also two other 
late pieces of mine. There is another which I cannot find. 
I am told there has been a talk of getting me appointed 
under-secretary to Lord Hillsborough ; but with little likelihood, as it is a settled point here, that I am too much of an 
American. I am in very good health, thanks to God : Your 
</p><p>
affectionate father, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
