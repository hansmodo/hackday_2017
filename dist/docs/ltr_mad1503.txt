DEAR SIR, Your favor without date was brought by thursday's post. It inclosed a cypher, for which I thank you, and 
which I shall make use of as occasion may require, though, from 
the nature of our respective situations, its chief value will be 
derived from your use of it. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="friend colleague met">General Washington</a> arrived here 
on Sunday last, and the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="friend colleague met">Marquis</a> on thursday. The latter came 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> in a French frigate. They have both been addressed and entertained in the best manner that circumstances 
would admit. These attentions, and the balloting for public 
offices, have consumed the greatest part of the past week. Mr. 
Jones is put into the place of Mr. Short; Mr. Roane and Mr. M. 
Selden are to go into those of Mr. M. Smith and Col. Christian, who are the victims to that part of the Constitution which 
directs a triennial purgation of the Council. The vote is not 
to take effect till the Spring, but was made now in consequence 
of the discontinuance of the spring session. The rejected Candidates were Col. Bland, Cyrus Griffin, G. Webb, W. C. Nicholas, 
Mr. Breckenridge, Col. Carrington. The latter was within one 
vote of Mr. Selden; Col. B., Mr. N., and Mr. B., had, as nearly 
as I recollect, between 20 and 30 votes ; Mr. G. & Mr. W. 
very few. Mr. H. Innes, late Judge of the Kentucky Court, 
is to succeed Walker Daniel, late Attorney General, in that 
District. His competitor was Mr. Stuart, who was about 15 
votes behind. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your's sincerely.
