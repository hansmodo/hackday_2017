My dear little Niece,
</p><p>
Your very interesting letter reached me a short time before your sweet little cousin & my little daughter was called from this world of sin, to enjoy the Heavenly happiness of Paradise. She died of Jaundice on the 25th of April.   [Jackson's error-- the baby died on May 25]   Whilst your Aunt Anna and myself feel our loss, yet we know that God has taken her away in love. Jesus says "suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of Heaven." Did you ever think my dear Grace that the most persons who have died and gone to Heaven are little children. Your aunt is doing very well, she is out visiting.
</p><p>
We hope to go & see you all this summer, but my health is so delicate, that I am disposed to go North first. I think this will give us more time to stay with you. Should we go to see you first I may have to hasten on North without staying more than two or three days.
</p><p>
I wish your would write to me at once and let me know which you would rather I should do. I hope that you have enjoyed your school and your vacation both very much. Remember your aunt & uncle to your Father, Mother, Thomas & Stark, and accept much love for yourself.
</p><p>
Your affectionate uncle,<br/>
