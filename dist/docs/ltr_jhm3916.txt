SIR: 
</p><p>
I herewith send you two copies of the laws passed in the last sessions. 
There are several inaccuracies in the printing, but it luckily happens 
that there is not one in the law giving extraordinary pi wers. In my last 
letter I forgot to take notice of the circumstances of the prisoners. I 
had a complaint made me some time ago, of their severe treatment, and 
represented it to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>, who, in consequence thereof, sent down 
the Commissary of prisoners to examine into the affairs, and on his 
return reported that he could find no marks of ill treatment of the 
prisoners, except that some of them were in want of clothing (which 
you know they are not obliged to find them). Whether he was deceived 
in his investigation of the matter, by false appearances, or what, we 
can t tell; but I have again spoken to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>, and he will have 
a further enquiry made. As to his taking prisoners out of our hands, 
you know the law of Congress authorises him so to do, and, as one of 
the United States, we are compelled to submit to it, however disagree 
able to our feelings. I have sent you thirty blank commissions, which 
are all I have. You will observe they are printed with <a href='/results.php?tla=jhr' rel='colleague'>Mr. Rutledge</a>'s 
name (and a few with mine); but, for want of others, I am obliged to 
make use of them, for our printer is sick, and I can get nothing done 
by him Ut present; nor has he printed any newspaper for some time 
past. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
