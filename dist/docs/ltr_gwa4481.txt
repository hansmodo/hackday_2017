Sir, 
</p><p>
I had last evening the honor of receiving your favor of the 31st of May by the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='co-worker'>Duke De Lauzun</a>, who informs me, that he is authorized by your Excellency 
and Count de Barras to enter into a free communication with me upon the subject of the council of war 
held on board the Duke de Bourgogne, and request my opinion upon the propriety of their determination. 
</p><p>
I must confess to your Excellency, that there is weight in the reasons, which are offered for the detention of his Majesty's fleet in the harbour of Newport, 
in preference to its going round to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ; but as I 
cannot think, that it will be as safe in all possible cases 
in the harbour of Newport, after the greater part of the 
French army has been withdrawn, as it would be in 
the harbour of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, I must adhere to my opinion, 
and to the plan fixed at Weathersfield, as most eligible, all circumstances considered. I would not, however, set up my single judgment against that of so 
many gentlemen of experience, more especially as the 
matter partly depends upon a knowledge of marine 
affairs, of which I candidly confess my ignorance. I 
would, then-fore, in order to avoid delay, rest the matter upon the following footing. If your Excellency, the 
Count de Barras, and the other gentlemen should, upon further consideration of the subject, aided by any 
new information, which you may have received, still 
think it most advisable to adhere to the former resolution of the council, you may make use of the enclosed 
letters to the governors of Massachusetts and Rhode 
Island, which are left open for your inspection. If, on the contrary, you should change your opinions, the letters may be destroyed, as that which was written by 
me to the governor of Rhode Island from Weathersfield will be sufficient for the purpose of calling out five 
hundred militia for the present, and such further numbers as exigencies may require. 
</p><p>
At any rate, I could wish that the march of the 
troops might now be hurried as much as possible. 
The strides, which the enemy are making at the southward, demand a collection of our force in this quarter, 
that we may endeavour to commence our operation. 
I know of no measure, which will be so likely to afford relief to the southern States, in so short a time, 
as a serious menace against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. This your 
Excellency may remember was a principal inducement 
for our undertaking that operation, in preference to the 
other, which was spoken of; and I assure you the calls 
upon me from the southward are so pressing, that nothing but seeing our preparations against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> m some degree of forwardness will content them, or 
convince them that they are likely to derive any advantages from the force, which they see detained here. I have the honor to be, &c. 
</p>
