DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I should have done myself the honor of writing to 
you earlier, "but postponed my intention in hopes of 
obtaining satisfactory intelligence of the force and 
designs of the enemy in this quarter. Although my 
expectations are far from being answered, I must en 
treat your Excellency's acceptance of what I have 
been able to collect on those subjects, lest the expected siege prolong my silence beyond the proper 
bounds. 
</p><p>
The day before yesterday, we had certain intelligence of the arrival of forty-five sail at North Edisto. 
A debarkation immediately commenced on Shnmons's Island; and an advanced corps, it is said, of five 
hundred, proceeded the following day to John's Is 
land. The Vigilant and two galleys are at Port 
Royal. Private accounts say that General Prevost is 
left to command at <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>; that his troops consist 
of the Hessians and Loyalists that were there before, 
reenforced by a corps of blacks and a detachment of 
savages. It is generally reported that Sir Henry 
Clinton commands the present expedition. It appears 
to me to be the British policy to transfer the theatre of the war to this vulnerable part of the Continent ; and, should their Commander-in-chief be here. 
I hope you will do him the honor to meet him. 
The command of your winter-quarters might very 
well be left to a Major-General, and the appearance 
of your Excellency, in person, would produce such 
effects as would decide the American contest. The 
Carolinians, as usual, have been superior to foresight 
and precaution. The delay of the enemy produced 
no other effect than to increase their supineness, and 
finally to introduce a disbelief of the enemy's intentions. But they begin to be roused. 
</p><p>
My father desires his most respectful compliments 
to your Excellency and Mrs. Washington. He has 
been detained here by M. Durumain's having taken 
French leave. This gentleman, who commanded the 
French frigate in this harbour, engaged to accommodate my father with a passage to France, but previously undertook a cruise in company with our American frigates. As soon, however, as he had passed 
the bar, he made the best of his way for Europe. 
A brace of two-deckers and a frigate are constantly 
standing off-and-on our harbour; but my father is 
determined, at all hards, to prosecute his voyage, 
and fulfil his engagements to the public. 
</p><p>
I preferred a hasty letter to a total silence ; your Excellency will be so indulgent as to excuse me for 
it, and assure Mrs. Washington of my respects. I 
have the honor to be, with the greatest veneration 
and attachment, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's faithful Aid, 
</p><p>
