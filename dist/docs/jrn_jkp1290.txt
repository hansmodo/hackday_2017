This morning my office was crowded with visitors. The prospect of the passage of the bill before Congress to raise ten regular regiments for the war against Mexico brought a large number of members of Congress with their constituents and friends seeking commissions in the army. . .

About two o'clock P.M. Mr. Kaufman, one of the Representatives from the State of Texas, called and had a long conversation with me about several matters of business, but chiefly about appointments in Texas. Among other things he informed me that General Houston was dissatisfied with the administration. I told him that I had received an intimation of the kind before, but that he had no cause to be so. The truth is that Senator Houston desires to be a candidate for the Presidency and probably thinks that I do not throw  my official influence into the scale to promote his views. He probably thinks, also, that he should have been looked to instead of Col. Benton for Lieutenant-General.
