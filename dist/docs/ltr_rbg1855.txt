It is a long time dearest Ann, since I have written to you- yet I have a very interesting letter to answer- and a day 
seldom passes without my thinking of you and my beloved brother- so many sad & stirring things happen in this un- 
happy state of our history that ones Mind is continually harassed & perplexed to know what is to happen next. I am 
joyful about Kentucky, and hope her loyal sons will so far outnumber the rebels that they will be afraid to shew their 
faces, on the soil that was honored by their patriotic Sires. .... <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Phila</a> is much over cast about the recent disasters- in 
which many of our prominent citizens are involved- our friend Mrs Fisher sadly grieved about her grandson Capt Mackoe who is a prisoner & wounded (slightly they say) but 
from accounts of the Richmond hospitals, they are destitute of every comfort- we thought as you do, about Mr Blairs 
mistake in the Fremont affair but he justifies himself on the plea, that it was a public affair- the great mortification they 
suffer, is having assisted to place them in power to do so much mischief- it seems to me that our friends are deficient 
in knowledge of human character- like other sanguine people they act from feeling- and misjudge those they love, who 
they think are as guileless as themselves- they have now made enemies of the Fremonts and the struggle will be between the General, and Frank,- if the former succeeds in his 
present command what will the government do? as I have no faith in politicians I am hopeless of seeing the right done 
unless Divine providence in pity to this noble country should put it in the heart of our rulers to take counsel by His holy 
law, and remember that we are one people and are shedding Brothers blood in this unholy war-

I had a letter from Miriam last week, the first since August- she says "My thoughts have been with you all continually & my tender sympathy (though unexpressed to him) is with My Dearly beloved & stricken Uncle, when you 
write to him do tell him all you know I feel for him, for no one so well as you know how fondly I cling to this darling 
Uncle"- poor Miriam! separated from all she loves except her own household, must have suffered greatly for want of information from home- her letter came open, under cover to 
the commanding officer at Norfolk 10 cts being inclosed, and postage p'd to Fortress Monroe whence by flag of truce - I 
tell you this, as it may facilitate your intercourse with your Jo, if he is in a southern camp - give my best love to My own 
Dear Brother and your dear girls- .... In happier times I hope we shall all meet again- tell My beloved brother how 
my heart yearns to embrace him 
</p><p>
May God bless you all prays your affectionate 
</p><p>
Sister
