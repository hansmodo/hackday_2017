DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
By a strange reverse of fortune we are driven to the sad 
necessity of abandoning Canada. I had the most sanguine hopes 
of collecting our army together, and driving the enemy below 
Dechambeau, in which I doubt not I should have succeeded, 
had not Burgoyne, with a strong party, arrived in Canada, and readied the Three Rivers the night before our people made 
the unfortunate attack upon that place under General Thompson. The particulars of this engagement I have not before had 
in my power to give you. I find our loss to amount to about a hundred and fifty. Colonel Wayne sustained the greatest, as 
his men began the attack, and behaved with great bravery, as did the Colonel himself. In short, all the officers behaved with 
great spirit, except some few of low rank ; and had not the number of the enemy been so superior, I doubt not the point Avould have been carried, in which case I should have pushed for Dechambeau, which, if secured, would have given us the 
command of the country. But this defeat convinced us that we came too late for the important purpose. 
</p><p>
I was determined, however, to hold <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a>, as it seemed the 
pleasure of Congress. But, after taking unwearied pains to fortify that post, and to collect the main body of the army to 
defend it, I found but twenty-five hundred at that place, and 
about a thousand more at the other garrisons, most of the latter being under inoculation, and those regiments, which had not 
the smallpox, expecting every day to be taken down with it. 
At the same time the British Heel, to the amount of thirty-six sail, had advanced into the Lake near us, and sixty-six lay 
at Three Elvers. The encampment of the enemy was, to appearance, very large, and every account proved their number to 
be exceedingly superior to ours. The Canadians, too, as far as 
the enemy advanced, were obliged to take arms or be destroyed. 
In this state of affairs I was much embarrassed, yet was determined to hold my ground at all hazards. 
</p><p>
But, to my great mortification, I found myself at the head 
of a dispirited army, iilled with horror at the thought of seeing  their enemy. Indeed, I was much surprised to see the 
scattered remains of this army, when I had them collected together. The smallpox, famine, and disorder, had rendered them 
almost lifeless. The flight from before Quebec, the fate of those 
at the Cedars, and the total loss of Sherburne's party, had, be 
fore my arrival with my brigade, destroyed all spirit among 
these troops ; but, upon our arrival, their spirit seemed to return. But, when they found this party defeated, and the number of the enemy increasing, I found a great panic again taking  place among both officers and soldiers. I had no less, I 
believe, than forty officers, who begged leave to resign their 
commissions upon the most trivial pretences, and this even Extended to Field-Officer?. The prevailing opinion was, that the 
enemy, instead of attacking our works, would get round us, and 
cut off our communication with the upper country, and destroy 
our retreat. This, indeed, they had completely in their power, 
as we had not force to dislodge them. I soon found, that how 
ever strongly I might fortify <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a>, my men would in general 
leave me upon appearance of the enemy. 
</p><p>
In this state of affairs I called a Council of all the Field-Officers, with the Baron de Woedtke, and they were almost 
unanimously for quitting the ground. <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a> was not 
present, but his opinion you have, as well as that of Colonel 
Hazen and Colonel Antill, in the inclosed letters. I then immediately decamped, taking with us every article, teven to a 
spade. The enemy, having a fair wind, was at our works in an 
hour after we left them. Our guards at Bertier, not coming in 
at the time they were ordered, were met by the enemy, forced 
to leave nine bateaux, and take to <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a> by land. This 
was all the loss we sustained. We retreated as far as <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>. This post not being tenable, we removed our bateaux 
over the rapids, with all the baggage and stores, except three 
pieces of cannon, which were too heavy to bring over the rapids, and indeed they were but bad pieces of ordnance at best. 
I then proceeded to St. John s, where every thing arrived in 
safety. We burnt the garrison at <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, with the gondolas 
and vessels there, leaving nothing but ruin behind us in the 
fort. We pulled up all the bridges in our way to St. John s. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a> did the same in the other road from Montreal, 
from which place he made a very prudent and judicious retreat, 
with an enemy close at his heels. 
</p><p>
When we got to St. John s, another Council was held, where 
it was unanimously agreed, that to attempt holding St. John's 
would be to expose the whole army to inevitable ruin, as our 
communication might be easily cut off, and the whole army fall 
a sacrifice. Previous to this, I received the resolves of Congress 
for six thousand militia, which I laid before the Council. They 
were all of opinion, that this would rather weaken than strength 
en our army, and further, that they could not possibly arrive in 
season to save us from a powerful army close at our heels. 
They were fully of opinion that, in the present unhealthy state 
of the army, it would be best to move to Crown Point, fortify 
that post, and build armed vessels to secure the navigation of the 
Lake. Upon this we immediately stripped the garrison of every article, took our bateaux, and retreated to this island. Further 
than this I could not go, without your or General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>'s 
orders, or the directions of Congress. I therefore send on the 
sick, the looks and numbers of which will present you with the 
most dismal spectacle ever furnished from one army in this quarter of the globe. I have sent on <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a> to give direction. at Crown Point, and receive your orders. The men, who 
are fit for duty, I shall retain here, ready to execute any orders 
you will please to communicate. 
</p><p>
Thus, dear General, I have given you an imperfect account 
of my unfortunate campaign. Claiming no merit, except in making  a safe and regular retreat, and although driven to it by inevitable necessity (as the Grand Post was lost before my arrival, and put beyond my power to regain), and although it was 
before an army much more powerful than mine, yet I am sufficiently mortified, and sincerely wish I had never seen this fatal 
country, unless I had arrived in season to have done some good 
to my country, and answered the expectations of Congress. Dear 
General, believe me to be, with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
