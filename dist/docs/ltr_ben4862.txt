DEAR Miss, 
</p><p>
I LAMENT with you most sincerely the unfortunate end of 
poor MUNGO. Few squirrels were better accomplished; 
for he had had a good education, had travelled far, and seen 
much of the world. As he had the honour of being, for his 
virtues, your favourite, he should not go, like common skuggs, 
without an elegy or an epitaph. Let us give him one in the 
monumental style and measure, which, being neither prose 
nor verse, is perhaps the properest for grief; since to use 
common language would look as if we were not affected, and 
to make rhymes would seem trifling in sorrow. 
</p><p>
EPITAPH. 
</p><p>
Alas! poor MUNGO! 
Happy wert thou, hadst thou known 
</p><p>
Thy own felicity. 
Remote from the fierce bald eagle, 
</p><p>
Tyrant of thy native woods, 
</p><p>
Thou hadst nought to fear from his piercing talons, 
Nor from the murdering gun 
Of the thoughtless sportsman. 
</p><p>
Safe in thy wired castle, 
</p><p>
GRIMALKIN never could annoy thee. 
</p><p>
Daily wert thou fed with the choicest viands, 
</p><p>
By the fair hand of an indulgent mistress ; 
</p><p>
But, discontented, 
</p><p>
Thou wouldst have more freedom. 
</p><p>
Too soon, alas ! didst thou obtain it ; 
</p><p>
And wandering, 
Thou art fallen by the fangs of wanton, cruel RANGER! 
</p><p>
Learn hence, 
</p><p>
Ye who blindly seek more liberty, 
</p><p>
Whether subjects, sons, squirrels or daughters, 
</p><p>
That apparent restraint may be real protection ; 
</p><p>
Yielding peace and plenty 
</p><p>
With security. 
</p><p>
You see, my dear Miss, how much more decent and proper 
this broken style is, than if we were to say, by way of epitaph, 
</p><p>
Here SKUGG 
Lies snug, 
As a bug 
In a rug. 
</p><p>
and yet, perhaps, there are people in the world of so little 
feeling as to think that this would be a good-enough epitaph 
for poor Mungo. 
</p><p>
If you wish it, I shall procure another to succeed him; 
but perhaps you will now choose some other amusement. 
</p><p>
Remember me affectionately to all the good family, and 
believe me ever, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend, B. FRANKLIN.
