Yesterday was a day of novel sensations to me. 
First came a letter from mother announcing her 
determination to return home, and telling us to be 
ready next week. Poor mother! she wrote drearily 
enough of the hardships we would be obliged to 
undergo in the dismantled house, and of the new 
experience that lay before us; but n imports! I am 
ready to follow her to Yankeeland, or any other 
place she chooses to go. It is selfish for me to be 
so happy here while she leads such a distasteful life 
in <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a>. In her postscript, though, she said she 
would wait a few days longer to see about the grand 
battle which is supposed to be impending; so our 
stay will be indefinitely prolonged. How thankful 
I am that we will really get back, though ! I hardly 
believe it possible, however; it is too good to be 
believed. 
</p><p>
The nightmare of a probable stay in <a href='/results.php?city=clinton' rel='city'>Clinton</a> being 
removed, I got in what the boys call a " perfect 
gale," and sang all my old songs with a greater relish 
than I have experienced for many a long month. 
My heart was open to every one. So forgiving and 
amiable did I feel that I went downstairs to see Will 
Carter! I made him so angry last Tuesday that he 
went home in a fit of sullen rage. It seems that some 
time ago, some one, he said, told him such a joke 
on me that he had laughed all night at it. Mortified 
beyond all expression at the thought of having had 
my name mentioned between two men, I, who have 
thus far fancied myself secure from all remarks 
good, bad, or indifferent (of men), I refused to have 
anything to say to him until he should either explain 
me the joke, or, in case it was not fit to be repeated 
to me, until he apologized for the insult. He took 
two minutes to make up a lie. This was the joke, 
he said. Our milkman had said that that Sarah 
Morgan was the proudest girl he ever saw ; that she 
walked the streets as though the earth was not good 
enough for her. My milkman making his remarks! 
I confess I was perfectly aghast with surprise, and 
did not conceal my contempt for the remark, or his 
authority either. But one can't fight one's milkman ! 
I did not care for what he or any of that class could 
say ; I was surprised to find that they thought at all ! 
But I resented it as an insult as coming from Mr. Carter, until with tears in his eyes fairly, and in all 
humility, he swore that, if it had been anything that 
could reflect on me in the slightest degree, he would 
thrash the next man who mentioned my name. 
I was not uneasy about a milkman's remarks, so I 
let it pass, after making him acknowledge that he 
had told me a falsehood concerning the remark 
which had been made. But I kept my revenge. 
I had but to cry " Milk!" in his hearing to make him 
turn crimson with rage. At last he told me that 
the less I said on the subject, the better it would be 
for me. I could not agree. "Milk" I insisted was 
a delightful beverage. I had always been under the 
impression that we owned a cow, until he had 
informed me it was a milkman, but was perfectly 
indifferent to the animal so I got the milk. With 
some such allusion, I could make him mad in an 
instant. Either a guilty conscience, or the real joke, 
grated harshly on him, and I possessed the power of 
making it still worse. Tuesday I pressed it too far. 
He was furious, and all the family warned me that 
I was making a dangerous enemy. 
</p><p>
Yesterday he came back in a good humor, and 
found me in unimpaired spirits. I had not talked 
even of "curds," though I had given him several 
hard cuts on other subjects, when an accident happened which frightened all malicious fun out of me. 
We were about going out after cane, and Miriam 
had already pulled on one of her buckskin gloves, 
dubbed "old sweety" from the quantity of cane-juice they contain, when Mr. Carter slipped on its 
mate, and held it tauntingly out to her. She tapped 
it with a case-knife she held, when a stream of blood 
shot up through the glove. A vein was cut and was 
bleeding profusely. 
</p><p>
He laughed, but panic seized the women. Some 
brought a basin, some stood around. I ran after 
cobwebs, while Helen Carter held the vein and 
Miriam stood in silent horror, too frightened to 
move. It was, indeed, alarming, for no one seemed 
to know what to do, and the blood flowed rapidly. 
Presently he turned a dreadful color, and stopped 
laughing. I brought a chair, while the others thrust 
him into it. His face grew more deathlike, his mouth 
trembled, his eyes rolled, his head dropped. I comprehended that these must be symptoms of fainting, 
a phenomenon I had never beheld. I rushed after 
water, and Lydia after cologne. Between us, it 
passed away ; but for those few moments I thought 
it was all over with him, and trembled for Miriam. 
Presently he laughed again and said, "Helen, if I 
die, take all my negroes and money and prosecute 
those two girls! don't let them escape!" Then, 
seeing my long face, he commenced teasing me. 
"Don't ever pretend you don't care for me again! 
Here you have been unmerciful to me for months, 
hurting more than this cut, never sparing me once, 
and the moment I get scratched, it's O Mr. Carter! 
and you fly around like wild and wait on me!" In 
vain I represented that I would have done the same 
for his old lame dog, and that I did not like him a 
bit better; he would not believe it, but persisted that 
I was a humbug and that I liked him in spite of my 
protestations. As long as he was in danger of bleeding to death, I let him have his way; and, frightened 
out of teasing, spared him for the rest of the evening. 
</p><p>
Just at what would have been twilight but for the 
moonshine, when he went home after the blood was 
stanched and the hand tightly bound, a carriage 
drove up to the house, and Colonel Allen was 
announced. I can't say I was ever more disappointed. I had fancied him tall, handsome, and 
elegant ; I had heard of him as a perfect fascinator, 
a woman-killer. Lo! a wee little man is carried in, 
in the arms of two others, wounded in both legs 
at <a href='/results.php?city=baton rouge' rel='city'>Baton Rouge</a>, he has never yet been able to stand. 
... He was accompanied by a Mr. Bradford, whose 
assiduous attentions and boundless admiration for 
the Colonel struck me as unusual. ... I had not 
observed him otherwise, until the General whispered, "Do you know that that is the brother of 
your old sweetheart?" Though the appellation was 
by no means merited, I recognized the one he meant. 
Brother to our Mr. Bradford of eighteen months 
ago! My astonishment was unbounded, and I 
alluded to it immediately. He said it was so; that 
his brother had often spoken to him of us, and the 
pleasant evenings he had spent at home.
