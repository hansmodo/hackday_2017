Dear Brother : We are now running in from Cape 
Henry Light and expect to reach Old Point by ten 
o'clock to-night. The ship vibrates so I can hardly 
write, but I must give you a few items. I have been to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=savannah" rel="city">Savannah</a>, Charleston, Wilmington, and Morehead City, 
closing up certain matters, whilst my army is marching 
up from Raleigh to Richmond. I will look for the advance at City Point by the llth, and hope we will be 
ordered on to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> to be mustered out. The 
South is whipped and submissive, and\if any statesmanship is displayed will be the last part of our country to 
rebel again. Thirty thousand surrendered at Goldsboro, 
and other scattered bands are surrendering at Tallahassee, 
Macon, Augusta, and different posts, that will swell the 
number to 50,000. We might as well have had Taylor's 
army in Alabama, and Smith's in Texas, but of that hereafter. On my way up the coast I met the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> 
papers of the 24th and 28th, which were dead against 
me. Of course I expected that, but I did not expect 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hwh" rel="colleague met">Halleck</a> and Stanton. They suppressed everything, save 
parts that by context with matters I never saw made a 
plausible case, but when I make my official report of the 
whole you will appreciate the game they have attempted. 
I met Mr. Chase at Morehead City, and even he was surprised to learn what I knew and told him, and I have 
from him the clue to the whole, which I must suppress 
for the time being. 
</p><p>
Grant at Ealeigh got his eyes opened also. I expect 
to spend the summer in Ohio, and we can discuss everything with my books and records before you ; but in the 
meantime do not commit yourself to any plan of reconstruction, but let Stanton try his hand and watch the 
consequences. My belief is that to force the enfranchised 
negroes, as "loyal" voters at the South, will produce 
new riot and war, and I fear Sumner, Wilson, and men of 
that school will force it on the Government or prolong 
the war ad infinitum. My army won't fight in that war. 
The slaves are free, but are not yet voters. The time 
has not yet come. Such a course will alienate a strength 
your party cannot spare. Don't fear me turning politician. Nothing changes my unalterable resolution, and 
you may so announce it. ... 
</p><p>
Yours,
