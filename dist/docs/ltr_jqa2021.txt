MR. RUSSELL, 
</p><p>
SIR, The late Revolution in France has opened an extensive 
field of speculation to the philosopher and to the politician. An 
event so astonishing and unexpected in its nature, and so important in its consequences, naturally arrested the peculiar attention of the whole civilized world. The friends of liberty and of 
man have seen with pleasure the temples of despotism levelled with the ground, and the Genius of Freedom rising suddenly in 
his collected and irresistible strength, and snapping in an instant all the cords with which, for centuries, he had been bound. Upon the downfall of the arbitrary system of government in France, 
there appears to have been but one sentiment, and that sentiment of exultation ; but while the friends of humanity have 
rejoiced at the emancipation of so many millions of their fellow 
creatures, they have waited with anxious expectation to see upon 
what foundations they would attempt to establish their newly- acquired liberty. The proceedings of their Representative Assembly have been contemplated in very different points of view, 
by men of names equally illustrious, and of characters equally 
favourable to the cause of liberty. Among the publications 
which have appeared upon the subject, two pamphlets, founded 
upon very different principles, appear to have been received with 
the greatest avidity, and seem calculated to leave the deepest 
impression. The one written by Mr. Burke, which is one continued invective upon almost all the proceedings of the National Assembly since the Revolution, and which passes a severe and 
indiscriminating censure upon almost all their transactions : The 
other the production of Mr. Paine, containing a defence of the 
Assembly, and approving every thing they have done, with applause as undistinguishing as is the censure of Mr. Burke. \Ve 
are told, that the copy from which an edition of this work was 
reprinted at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, was furnished by the Secretary of 
State, and was accompanied by a letter, from which the follow 
ing extract has been published in most of our newspapers. "I 
am extremely pleased to find that it is to be re-printed here, and 
that something is at length to be publicly said, against the political heresies which have sprung up among us. I have no doubt 
our citizens will rally a second time round the standard of Common Sense." 
</p><p>
I confess, Sir, I am somewhat at a loss to determine, what this very respectable gentleman means by political heresies. Does he 
consider this pamphlet of Mr. Paine's as the canonical book of political scripture? As containing the true doctrine of popular 
infallibility, from which it would be heretical to depart in one single point? The expressions, indeed, imply more ; they seem, 
like the Arabian prophet, to call upon all true believers in the Islam of democracy, to draw their swords, and, in the fervour of their devotion, to compel all their countrymen to cry out, "There 
is but one Goddess of Liberty, and Common Sense is her prophet." 
</p><p>
I have always understood, Sir, that the citizens of these States were possessed of a full and entire freedom of opinion upon all 
subjects, civil as well as religious ; they have not yet established any infallible criterion of orthodoxy, either in church or state : 
their principles in theory, and their habits in practice, are equally 
averse to that slavery of the mind, which adopts, without examination, any sentiment that has the sanction of a venerable name. 
Nullius in verba jurare magistri is their favorite maxime ; and the 
only political tenet which they would stigmatize with the name 
of heresy, would be that which should attempt to impose an 
opinion upon their understandings upon the single principle of 
authority. 
</p><p>
I believe, also, Sir, that the citizens of America are not at 
present disposed to rally round the standard of any man. In 
the full possession and enjoyment of all the freedom, for which 
they have gone through so arduous a conflict, they will not, for 
the poor purpose of extinguishing a few supposed political heresies, 
return to the horrors of a civil contest, from which they could 
reap no possible benefit, and which would probably terminate in 
the loss of that liberty for which they have been so liberal of their 
treasure and of their blood. 
</p><p>
If, however, Mr. Paine is to be adopted as the holy father of 
our political faith, and this pamphlet is to be considered as his 
Papal Bull of infallible virtue, let us at least examine what it 
contains. Before we determine to join the standard, let us in 
quire what are the articles of war to which our General requires 
our submission. It is the glorious characteristic of truth, at once 
to invite and bid defiance to investigation. If any opinions 
which have sprung up among us have really led us astray from 
the standard of truth, let us return to it, at the call of Mr. Paine, 
or of any other man who can show us our errors. But, Sir, if upon examination, even this testament of orthodoxy shall be 
found to contain many spurious texts, false in their principles 
and delusive in their inferences, we may be permitted, notwithstanding our reverence for the author, at least to expunge the 
apocryphal doctrine, and to confine our faith to the genuine 
tenets of real political inspiration. It is my intention to submit 
to the public a few observations, which have occurred to me 
upon the perusal of this pamphlet, which has so clear and valid 
a title to the public attention. But I must here observe, that I 
wish to avoid every appearance of disrespect, either to the real 
parent of this production, or to the gentleman who has stood its 
sponsor in this country. Both these gentlemen are entitled to 
the gratitude of their countrymen; the latter still renders important services in a very dignified station. He is a friend to free 
inquiry upon every subject, and he will not be displeased to see 
the sentiments which he has made his own by a public adoption, 
canvassed with as much freedom as is consistent with the reverence due to his character. 
</p><p>
SIR, In that part of Mr. Paine's pamphlet which he has chosen 
to call the miscellaneous chapter, he observes that, "when a man 
in a long course attempts to steer his course by any thing else 
than some polar truth or principle, he is sure to be lost." I have 
sought for the polar principle to which his exertions were directed 
in this publication, and I must acknowledge I have sought in 
vain. His production is historical, political, miscellaneous, satirical, and panegyrical. It is an encomium upon the National 
Assembly of France. It is a commentary upon the rights of 
man, inferring questionable deductions from unquestionable principles. It is a severe satire upon Mr. Burke and his pamphlet 
upon the English Government, upon Kings, upon Nobility, and 
Aristocracy; it is a narrative of several occurrences, connected 
with the French Revolution, and it concludes with a kind of prophetical impulse, in the expectation of an "European Congress 
to patronize the progress of free government, and promote the civilization of nations with each other" The object which he promised 
to himself, in this publication, is not so dubious as the principle 
on which he wrote. His intention appears evidently to be, to 
convince the people of Great Britain that they have neither 
Liberty nor a Constitution that their only possible means to 
produce these blessings to themselves, is to "topple down head 
long" their present government, and follow implicitly the example 
of the French. As to the right, he scruples not to say, "that 
which a whole nation chuses to do, it has a right to do." This 
proposition is a part of what Mr. Paine calls a system of principles in opposition to those of Mr. Burke, and it is laid down 
without any sort of qualification. It is not my intention to 
defend the principles of Mr. Burke ; truth is the only object of 
my pursuit, and I shall without hesitation refuse my assent to 
every principle inconsistent with that, whether it proceeds from 
Mr. Burke, Mr. Paine, or even from the illustrious National 
Assembly of France. This principle, that a whole nation has a 
right to do whatever it pleases, cannot in any sense whatever be 
admitted as true. The eternal and immutable laws of justice and 
of morality are paramount to all human legislation. The violation of those laws is certainly within the power, but it is not among 
the rights of nations. The power of a nation is the collected 
power of all the individuals which compose it. The rights of a 
nation are in like manner the collected rights of its individuals ; 
and it must follow from thence, that the powers of a nation are 
more extensive than its rights, in the very same proportion with 
those of individuals. It is somewhat remarkable that, in speak 
ing of the exercise of the particular right of forming a Constitution, Mr. Paine himself denies to a nation that omnipotence which 
he had before so liberally bestowed. For this same nation, which 
has a right to do whatever it pleases, has no right to establish a 
Government in hereditary succession. It is of infinite consequence, 
that the distinction between power and right should be fully acknowledged, and admitted as one of the fundamental principles 
of Legislators. A whole nation, such as France, England, or 
America, can act only by representation ; and the acts of the representative body must be considered as the acts of the nation. 
We must go farther, and say, that the acts of the majority in the Representative Assembly are the acts of the whole body, and 
consequently of the whole nation. If, therefore, a majority thus constituted are bound by no law human or divine, and have no 
other rule but their sovereign will and pleasure to direct them, what possible security can any citizen of the nation have for the 
protection of his unalienable rights? The principles of liberty must still be the sport of arbitrary power, and the hideous form 
of despotism must lay aside the diadem and the scepter, only to assume the party-colored garments of democracy. 
</p><p>
The system of principles upon which Mr. Paine advances 
this assertion is intended to prove, that the English nation have 
a right to destroy their present form of Government, and to erect 
another. I am not disposed to deny this right, nor is it at present 
necessary to examine whether Mr. Burke's opinions upon this 
subject are not directed rather against the expediency than the 
abstracted rights of such a measure. It may, however, not be 
improper to trace the origin of Mr. Paine's arguments against the 
principles maintained by Mr. Burke. Doctor Price has asserted, 
that by "the principles of the Revolution in 1688 the people of 
England had acquired the right, I. To choose their own Governors. 2. To cashier them for misconduct ; and, 3. To frame a 
Government for themselves. * Mr. Burke endeavors to prove 
that the principles of the Revolution in 1688, so far from war 
ranting any right of this kind, support a doctrine almost diametrically opposite. Mr. Paine, in reply, cuts the Gordian knot 
at once, declares the Parliament of 1688 to have been downright 
usurpers, censures them for having unwisely sent to Holland for a 
King, denies the existence of a British Constitution, and invites 
the people of England to overturn their present Government, and 
to erect another upon the broad basis of national sovereignty, and government by representation. As Mr. Paine has departed 
altogether from the principles of the Revolution, and has torn 
up by the roots all reasoning from the British Constitution, by 
the denial of its existence, it becomes necessary to examine his 
works upon the grounds which he has chosen to assume. If we 
judge of the production from its apparent tendency, we may call 
it an address to the English nation, attempting to prove that they 
have a right to form a new Constitution, that it is expedient for 
them immediately to exercise that right, and that, in the formation of this Constitution, they can do no better than to imitate 
the model set before them by the French National Assembly. 
However immethodical his production is, I believe the whole of 
its argumentative part may be referred to these three points. If 
the subject were to affect only the British nation, we might leave 
them to reason and act for themselves ; but, Sir, these are concerns equally important to all mankind ; and the citizens of 
America are called upon from high authority to rally round the 
standard of this champion of Revolutions. I shall therefore now 
proceed to examine the reasons upon which he founds his opinions 
relative to each of these points. 
</p><p>
The people of England have, in common with other nations, a 
natural and unalienable right to form a Constitution of Government, not because a whole nation has a right to do whatever it 
chooses to do, but because Government being instituted for the 
common security of the natural rights of every individual, it must be liable to alterations whenever it becomes incompetent 
for that purpose. The right of a people to legislate for succeed ing generations derives all its authority from the consent of that 
posterity who are bound by their laws ; and therefore the expressions of perpetuity used by the Parliament of 1688, contain no 
absurdity; and expressions of a similar nature may be found in all the Constitutions of the United States. 
</p><p>
But, Sir, when this right is thus admitted in its fullest latitude, it must also be admitted, that it ought never to be exercised but 
in cases of extreme urgency : Every nation has a right as unquestionable to dissolve the bands of civil society, by which they are 
united, and to return to that state of individual imbecility in which man is supposed to have existed, previous to the formation 
of the social compact. The people of America have been compelled, by an unaccountable necessity, distressing in its operation, 
but glorious in its consequences, to exercise this right ; and when ever a nation has no other alternative but the degradation of 
slavery, or the formidable conflict of a Revolution, the generous spirit of freedom will not hesitate a moment in the choice. Whether 
the people of France were, at the period of their Revolution, reduced to that unhappy situation, which rendered it absolutely 
necessary to overthrow their whole system to its foundation, is a question upon which the ablest patriots among themselves have 
differed, and upon which we are inadequate to decide. Whether the people of England are now in that calamitous predicament? 
is a question more proper for our discussion, and upon which I 
shall take the liberty to examine the reasoning of Mr. Paine. 
</p><p>
SIR, In examining the question, whether the English nation 
have a right, fundamentally to demolish their present form of 
government? it becomes necessary to inquire whether Mr. Paine's 
assertion that there is no such thing as an English Constitution, 
be really true? This question may, perhaps, in some measure 
affect the people of America. For if the government of Great 
Britain is an usurpation, it may be worthy of consideration how 
far we are bound by treaties, which do not reciprocally bind the 
inhabitants of that island. 
</p><p>
"A Constitution," says Mr. Paine, "is not a thing in name 
only but in fact. It has not an ideal, but a real existence; and 
wherever it cannot be produced in a visible form, there is none." 
Mr. Paine should have gone farther, and told us, whether, like 
a deed, it must be written on paper or parchment, or whether it has a larger latitude, and may be engraved on stone, or carved 
in wood? From the tenor of his argument it should seem, that 
he had only the American Constitutions in his mind, for excepting 
them, I believe he would not find in all history, a government 
which will come within his definition ; and of course, there never 
was a people that had a Constitution, previous to the year 1776. 
But the word with an idea affixed to it, had been in use, and commonly understood, for centuries before that period, and therefore 
Mr. Paine must, to suit his purpose, alter its acceptations, and in 
the warmth of his zeal for Revolutions, endeavor to bring about 
a revolution in language also. When all the most illustrious 
Whig writers in England have contended for the liberty of their 
country upon the principles of the English Constitution; when 
the glorious Congress of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1774">1774</a> declared, that "the inhabitants of 
the English Colonies in North America were entitled to certain 
rights by the immutable laws of nature, the principles of the English 
Constitution, and the several charters or compacts," they knew 
very well what they meant, and were perfectly understood by all 
mankind. Mr. Paine says, that "a Constitution is to a Government, what the laws, made afterwards by that Government, are 
to a court of judicature." But when the American States, by 
their Constitutions, expressly adopted the whole body of the 
common law, so far as it was applicable to their respective situations, did they adopt nothing at all, because that law cannot be 
produced in a visible form? No, Sir, the Constitution of a country is not the paper or parchment upon which the compact is 
written, it is the system of fundamental laws, by which the people have consented to be governed, which is always supposed to be 
impressed upon the mind of every individual, and of which the written or printed copies are nothing more than the evidence. 
</p><p>
In this sense, Sir, the British nation have a Constitution, which was for many years the admiration of the world ; the people of 
America, with very good reason, have renounced some of its defects and infirmities. But in defence of some of its principles, 
they have fought and conquered. It is composed of a venerable 
system of unwritten or customary laws, handed down from time immemorial, and sanctioned by the accumulated experience of 
ages ; and of a body of statutes enacted by an authority lawfully 
competent to that purpose. Mr. Paine is certainly mistaken, 
when he considers the British government as having originated in 
the conquest of William of Normandy. This principle of being 
governed by an oral or traditionary law, prevailed in England 
eleven hundred years before that invasion. It has continued to 
this day, and has been adopted by all the American States. I 
hope they will never abolish a system so excellent, merely because 
it cannot be produced in a visible form. The Constitution of 
Great Britain is a Constitution of principles, not of articles, and 
however frequently it may have been violated by tyrants, monarchical, aristocratical, or democratical, the people have always 
found it expedient to restore the original foundation, while from 
time to time they have been successful in improving and ornamenting the building. 
</p><p>
The people of England are bound therefore by a social compact 
now existing; and they have no right to demolish their Government, unless it be clearly incompetent for the purposes for which 
it was instituted. They have delegated their whole collective 
power to a Legislature, consisting of a King, Lords, and Commons, 
and they have included even the power of altering the Constitution itself. Should they abuse this power so that the nation 
itself should be oppressed, and their rights to life, liberty and 
property, instead of protection, should meet with tyranny, the 
people would certainly be entitled to appeal in the last resort to 
themselves, to resume the trust which has been so unworthily 
betrayed, and (not to do whatever they should choose, but) to 
form another Constitution, which should more permanently 
secure the natural rights of the whole community. The same 
may be said of the National Assembly of France, who, according 
to Mr. Paine's idea, are possessed of the whole collective power 
of the nation, and who seem, like him, to think they have a right of the present Assembly is different to what the authority of future 
Assemblies will be." But if the present Assembly should decree that all future National Assemblies should possess the same power 
with themselves, it would certainly be binding as an article of 
the Constitution. Mr. Paine, indeed, will not acknowledge this, 
and it is the second right which he denies his nation, which at the 
same time has a right to do every thing. Mr. Paine's ideas upon 
this subject appear to have been formed by a partial adoption of 
the principle upon which Rousseau founds the social compact. 
But neither the principle of Rousseau, nor that of Mr. Paine, is 
true. Rousseau contends that the social compact is formed by a 
personal association of individuals, which must be unanimously 
assented to, and which cannot possibly be made by a representative body. I shall not at present spend my time in showing that 
this is neither practicable nor even metaphysically true. I shall 
only observe, that its operation would annihilate in an instant, 
all the power of the National Assembly, and turn the whole body 
of the American Constitutions, the pride of man, the glory of the 
human understanding, into a mass of tyrannical and unfounded usurpations. Mr. Paine does not go quite so far, but we must 
examine whether his arguments are not equally wide from the 
truth. "A Government," says he, "on the principles on which 
constitutional Governments arising out of society are established, 
cannot have the right of altering itself. Why not? Because if it 
had, it would be arbitrary." But this reason is not sufficient. A 
nation in forming a social compact may delegate the whole of 
their collective powers to ordinary legislatures, in perpetual succession, and reserve only the right of refusing the abuse of those 
powers ; and every other question relative to the reservation of 
powers to the nation, must be only a question of expediency. 
The same power which the present National Assembly possess in 
France, is, by the English Constitution, constantly vested in the 
King and Parliament of Great Britain ; and the people in both 
kingdoms have the same right to resist and punish the abuse of that power. 
</p><p>
Surely, Sir, the people of the United States have a Constitution, although they have given the power of making alterations 
to those by whom it is administered, in conjunction with the 
State Legislatures. Surely, the people of Massachusetts have a 
Constitution, though it provides for certain alterations by the 
ordinary Legislatures, and though, since it was formed, such 
alterations have accordingly been made. The Constitutions of 
several of the United States are expressly made alterable in every 
part by their ordinary Legislatures. I think there is not one of 
them but admits of alterations without recurring to "the nation 
in its original character." Yet Mr. Paine will surely acknowledge, 
that the American Constitutions arose out of the people, and not 
over them. His principle, therefore, "that a Constitutional 
Government cannot have the right of altering itself," is not true. 
In forming their Constitution, a nation may reserve to themselves 
such powers as they may think proper. They may reserve only 
the unalienable right of resistance against tyranny. The people 
of England have reserved only this right. The French National 
Assembly have been in session more than two years to make laws 
nominally paramount to their future Legislatures. I shall hazard 
some observations upon this subject, when I attempt to follow 
Mr. Paine through his comparison between the French and English Constitutions. But as the English have delegated all their 
power, I contend they have no right in their original character 
to change their form of Government, unless it has become incompetent for the purposes for which all Governments are instituted. 
I am aware of the question which will occur here. Who is to judge of this incompetency? and I am aware of the triumphant 
manner in which it may be asked. But a triumph is not my object, and in the pursuit of truth I shall venture in my next number to consider this subject. 
</p><p>
SIR, I have assumed for a principle, that the English nation, having delegated all their collective power, have no right in their 
original character to change their form of Government, unless it 
has become absolutely inadequate to the purposes for which it 
was instituted. The people themselves must, from the necessity 
of the case, be the judges of this fact ; but if, in forming this judgment, and acting in pursuance of it, they proceed from passion, 
and not from principle ; if they dissolve their compact, from an 
idea that "they have a right to do whatever they choose," and 
break the bands of society, in the forms of despotism, "because 
such is their pleasure," they may indeed go through the operation 
by the plenitude of their irresistible power ; but the nation will 
meet with ample punishment in their own misery, and the leaders 
who delude them, in the detestation of their own posterity. It is 
not by adopting the malignity of a political satyrist, by convert 
ing the sallies of wit into the maxims of truth or justice, or by 
magnifying trivial imperfections into capital crimes, that a nation 
will be justified in resorting to its original strength, to contend 
against its delegated power. It is not now a mechanical horror 
against the name of a king, or of aristocracy, nor a physical antipathy to the sound of an extravagant title, or to the sight of an 
innocent riband that can authorise a people to lay violent hands 
upon the Constitution, which protects their rights, and guards 
their liberties. They must feel an actual deprivation of their 
equal rights, and see an actual impossibility for their restoration 
in any other manner, before they can have a right to lay their 
hands on their swords, and appeal to Heaven. These are not the 
principles of slavery ; they are the tenets of the only genuine 
liberty, which consists in a mean equally distant from the despotism of an individual, as of a million. They are sanctioned by 
our own uniform example, and will, I trust, never be departed 
from by the most enlightened, and most virtuous people on the 
globe. For sixteen years the people of America endured a continual succession of every indignity, which the pride of dominion, the insolence of power, and the rapacity of avarice, could inflict 
upon them, before they could resolve to renounce an authority 
three thousand miles distant from them ; and even then, they were 
so far from thinking they had a right to do whatever they chose, 
that by the very act which renounced their connection with 
Great Britain they exposed to the world their own sufferings, and 
the various acts of tyranny which had compelled them "to ac 
quiesce in the necessity which denounced the separation," and 
"appealed to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of 
their intentions." No, Sir, the venerable character who drew up 
this declaration never could believe that the rights of a nation 
have no other limits than its powers. Since the Revolution, the 
people of the United States have again been compelled to form 
a national Government, and in its formation proceeded in the same 
spirit. The confederation was found totally incompetent for the 
purposes for which it was instituted ; not from abuse of the 
delegated powers, in those by whom it was administered, but 
because scarcely any powers at all had been given. The inefficiency of that system had long been fully demonstrated, and had 
reduced us to extreme distress. The States, united but in name, 
were upon the verge of general bankruptcy. Their credit, sunk 
to the lowest ebb, was upon the point of expiring, and their exhausted treasury gave perpetually the lie to their public faith, 
so often and so solemnly pledged. The forcible ties of a common 
interest, directed to one great object during the war, were greatly 
loosened by the accomplishment of that object, and the seeds of 
mutual hostility were sown by the partial commercial regulations 
of the respective States. The revenue laws which had been enacted 
in several of the States were not able to support their credit, and 
yet were so unequal in their operation, that numerous bodies of 
men, in more than one of the States, appeared in open rebellion 
against the mildest governments that ever were instituted. In 
stead of the glorious reward which the people had expected for 
their virtuous exertions, internal discord, and infamy abroad, 
presented themselves in dreary perspective before them. At this 
critical period, when the system to be annihilated was an empty 
name, and there was only a Government to be formed, the national 
Constitution was presented to the people of America " in 
their original character " ; and even there its existence was to 
depend upon the assent of nine States, that is, two-thirds of the 
people. Very fortunately it has at length been freely adopted 
by all the members of the Union ; but the extreme difficulty 
which impeded the progress of its adoption, and the various 
amendments, which, in many of the States, were in a manner 
made the condition of their assent, exhibit the fullest evidence, 
what a more than Herculean task it is to unite the opinions of a 
free people, upon any system of government whatever. 
</p><p>
Under the sanction of such authority, I venture to assert that 
the people of England have no right to destroy their government, 
unless in its operation the rights of the people are really oppressed, 
and unless they have attempted in vain every constitutional 
mode of obtaining redress. These principles ought to operate 
with peculiar force upon the people of England, because, in the 
uncertain and hazardous event of a revolution, they have more 
to lose and less to gain, than any other European nation, and be 
cause whatever they may acquire, must, in all probability, be 
purchased at the expense of a civil war. When provision is made 
for the alteration of a constitution, otherwise than by the common 
legislative power, it may be done comparatively without difficulty 
or danger; but where this power is already delegated, with the 
other powers of legislation, the people cannot use it themselves, 
except in their original, individual unrepresented character, and 
they cannot acquire the right to act in that capacity, until the 
power which they have thus conveyed in trust, has been abdicated 
by the extreme abuses of its administration. 
</p><p>
When Mr. Paine invited the people of England to destroy their 
present Government and form another Constitution, he should have 
given them sober reasoning and not flippant witticisms. He 
should have explained to them the nature of the grievances by 
which they are oppressed, and demonstrated the impossibility 
of reforming the Government in its present organization. He 
should have pointed out to them some possible method for them 
to act in their original character, without a total dissolution of 
civil society among them ; he should have proved what great 
advantages they would reap as a nation from such a revolution, 
without disguising the great dangers and formidable difficulties 
with which it must be attended. 
</p><p>
The principal and most dangerous abuses in the English Government arise less from the defects inherent in the Constitution, than 
from the state of society; the universal venality and corruption 
which pervade all classes of men in that kingdom, and which 
a change of government could not reform. I shall consider this 
subject more largely hereafter; but at present, with respect to 
the expediency of a revolution in England, I must inquire how the 
nation can be brought to act in their original character? Mr. Paine, perhaps, from the delicacy of his situation, has saidnothing 
openly upon this very important point. Yet, in two different 
parts of his work, he seems obscurely to hint two methods for the 
accomplishment of this object. When he compares the situation 
of the citizens of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> to that of the inhabitants of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> just 
before the taking of the Bastille, it seems as if it was with an intention to recommend a similar insurrection for the purpose of dispersing the Parliament, and expelling the King, which would 
leave the nation without any government at all, and compel them 
at all events to act in their original character. When he advises 
" Revolutions by accommodation," he must probably mean, that 
a convention should be called by act of Parliament to regenerate 
their Constitution. I can not imagine any other method of answer 
ing his purpose. Mr. Paine seems to think it as easy for a nation 
to change its government, as for a man to change his coat; but I 
confess, both the modes of proceeding which he suggests appear 
to me to be liable to great objections. 
</p><p>

" There are in all European countries," says Mr. Paine, "a large class of people of that description, which in England are called the mob." It was by the people of this description that 
the Bastille in Paris was destroyed. In <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> there is no 
Bastille to demolish ; but there is a government to overturn ; and 
there is a King and Parliament, who must either be put to flight, 
or compelled to call a convention for the purpose of forming a 
Constitution. "In the commencement of a Revolution those 
men are rather the followers of the camp than of the standard of 
liberty, and have yet to be instructed how to reverence it." As 
these men were made instrumental to the accomplishment of the 
Revolution in France, Mr. Paine appears to intimate that they 
may be employed for a similar purpose in England. I am as little 
disposed as Mr. Paine can be, to reproach either the whole nation 
to which they belong, or that unhappy class of human beings 
themselves, for the devastation which they commit. They cannot 
be considered as free agents, and therefore are neither the subjects 
of praise or blame ; but the friend of humanity will be extremely 
cautious how he ventures to put in action a tremendous power, 
which is competent only to the purposes of destruction, and totally 
incapable either to create or to preserve. This class of men, of 
whom it is the happiness of Americans scarcely to be able to form 
an idea, can be brought to act in concert upon no other principles 
than those of a frantic enthusiasm and ungovernable fury ; their 
profound ignorance and deplorable credulity make them proper 
tools for any man who can inflame their passions, or alarm their 
superstition; and as they have nothing to lose by the total dissolution of civil society, their rage may be easily directed against 
any victim which may be pointed out to them. They are altogether incapable of forming a rational judgment either upon the 
principles or the motives of their own conduct; and whether the 
object for which they are made to contend, be good or bad, the 
brutal arm of power is all the assistance they can afford for its 
accomplishment. To set in motion this inert mass, the eccentric 
vivacity of a madman is infinitely better calculated than the sober 
coolness of phlegmatic reason. They need only to be provoked and 
irritated, and they never can in any other manner be called into 
action. In the year <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1780">1780</a>, they assembled at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> to the number of 60,000, under the direction of Lord GEORGE GORDON, and 
carrying fire and slaughter before them, were upon the point of 
giving the whole city of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> to one undistinguished devastation and destruction: and this, because the Parliament had mitigated the severity of a sanguinary and tyrannical law of persecution against the Roman Catholics. Should these people be 
taught that they have a right to do every thing, and that the titles 
of Kings and Nobles, and the wealth of Bishops, are all usurpations 
and robberies committed upon them, I believe it would not be 
difficult to rouse their passions, and to prepare them for every 
work of ruin and destruction. But, Sir, when they are once put 
in motion, they soon get beyond all restraint and control. The 
rights of man, to life, liberty, and property, oppose but a feeble 
barrier to them ; the beauteous face of nature, and the elegant 
refinements of art, the hoary head of wisdom, and the enchanting 
smile of beauty, are all equally liable to become obnoxious to 
them ; and as all their power consists in destruction, whatever 
meets with their displeasure must be devoted to ruin. Could any 
thing but an imperious, over-ruling necessity justify any man, or 
body of men, for using a weapon like this to operate a Revolution 
in Government? Such indeed was the situation of the French 
National Assembly, when they directed the electric fluid of this 
popular frenzy against the ancient fabric of their monarchy. 
They justly thought that no price could purchase too dearly the 
fall of arbitrary power in an individual, but, perhaps, even they 
were not aware of all the consequences which might follow from 
committing the existence of the kingdom to the custody of a lawless 
and desperate rabble. 
</p><p>
But do the people of England labor under such intolerable 
oppression, as would authorise any of their patriots to employ an 
arm like this for their relief? Suppose sixty thousand men should 
again assemble round Westminster-hall, and with clubs and fire 
brands for their sole arguments, should compel the Parliament 
to call a convention to make a Constitution, what would be the 
probable consequences? Is it clear that so large a majority of the people of England have lost all their attachment to their Constitution, as to insure an acquiescence in the measure throughout the  
kingdom? Is it certain that one quarter part of the people would obey an act extorted by such violence as that? Would not all 
the friends of the present Government rally round the standard of the Constitution, and would not their duty compel them to 
defend it with their lives and fortunes? If it should soon appear that they were decidedly the strongest party, would not the insurrection be extinguished in the blood of its leaders? If the 
parties should prove to be nearly equal, would not the nation be 
involved in all the horrors of a long and bloody civil war? In 
whatever point of view, the effects of this scheme are contemplated, 
they present nothing but prospects at which every friend of man 
kind must shudder; nor can I possibly believe that Mr. Paine, 
who is certainly a benevolent man, would deliberately recommend this method, though, in his ardent zeal for the honor of the 
French nation, and the propagation of their doctrine, he has incautiously suggested it. 
</p><p>
But he recommends Revolutions by accommodation ; which, 
applied to England, must mean that a convention be called by 
a free and deliberate act of Parliament, to alter the Constitution ; 
but this plan appears to be equally dangerous with the other, and 
more impracticable; while, by a singular fatality, an act of this 
kind would be the completest evidence of its own inutility, it would 
be equally dangerous, because by a formal act of competent 
authority it would expose the kingdom to all the evils of anarchy 
and of war, which in the other case would result from a popular 
convulsion. It would be less practicable, because it is contrary 
to nature, that any body of men should venture to perform the 
most transcendent act of power of which human beings are capable, 
for the single purpose of divesting themselves of all power whatever. 
It would prove its own inutility, because no man will presume that 
they ought to take such a measure, unless the wishes of a clear 
and decided majority of the people are favorable to an alteration 
of the Government. If they are disposed to act in conformity with the desires of the people, the very same power which would 
authorise them to dissolve the Government, would likewise justify them in making any alterations which would meet with the wishes 
of the nation, and would render a recurrence to them" in their original character " perfectly unnecessary. 
</p><p>
Whatever Mr. Paine's opinion may be with respect to the existence of an English Constitution, it is certain that every member of the British Parliament who gives his vote in the making 
of a new law, or the alteration of an old one, must suppose that he acts by virtue of a Constitutional right vested in him ; but the 
same right which authorises him to give his suffrage in the most trifling object of legislation, has vested in the Parliament, of which 
he is a member, the whole power of the British nation, and he cannot possibly deny their right without utterly destroying his 
own. The right of the individual depends altogether upon the right of the corporation, and his right to vote for the regulation 
of a turnpike, or the toll of a bridge, is the same with theirs to make every necessary and convenient alteration in the Constitution 
of the kingdom itself. While they are thus convinced of their 
right to exercise these great powers, would it not be the summit 
of extravagance and folly in them, nay, would it not be the most 
flagrant breach of the trust reposed in them, of which they could 
possibly be guilty, to abdicate an authority lawfully committed 
to them, to declare themselves altogether incompetent to a wise 
and prudent use of a Constitutional power, and to commit the 
peace, the welfare, the very existence of the nation, to the uncertain and hazardous event of a Revolution? 
</p><p>
If, however, we can suppose that the Parliament should finally accede to the idea, that they are mere tyrants without the shadow 
of a right to the authority which they have hitherto exercised, the only act which they could agree to, would be a vote to dissolve 
themselves, and leave the vessel of the state without either a pilot or a rudder. For the very act of calling a convention would be 
an usurpation, and, from the importance of its consequences, an usurpation of the most daring nature : it would be assuming the 
right to dissolve the ties of society, and at the same instant acknowledging that this assumed right was without any sort of 
foundation. In short, this plan of calling a convention to alter the Constitution, by act of Parliament, appears to me, in what 
ever light it be considered, to involve an absurdity. 
</p><p>
But, as there is unquestionably somewhere in England, a combination of the right and of the power to alter the Constitution 
of the country, and as that Constitution is indubitably liable to be improved, we may be permitted to inquire, whether a blind 
imitation of the French National Assembly would probably promote the happiness of the people, the only objects for which all 
Governments were instituted, or which can authorise their alteration. 
</p><p>
SIR, Mr. Paine affirms that the French nation have a Constitution, and that the English have none. I have already offered a 
few observations upon the latter part of this assertion ; but, as a 
preliminary to some remarks which I propose to make upon his 
comparison, I must premise, that directly the reverse of his 
opinion upon this subject is the truth, and that in reality the English nation have a Constitution, and the French as yet have none. 
The National Assembly have indeed been constantly sitting these 
two years, to form a Constitution ; and at the ceremony of the 
Federation about eleven months since, they swore themselves and 
their King to the observance of a Constitution to be made. But 
as they are still possessed of the whole power of the nation, they 
may repeal any article upon which they have hitherto agreed, by 
virtue of the same authority, which enabled them to pass the 
decree, and, therefore, according to Mr. Paine's own ideas, the 
French cannot be said to have a Constitution, until the National 
Assembly shall please to dissolve themselves, and to put their 
whole system into full operation. 
</p><p>
I have endeavored to show that it is not absolutely essential to the existence of a Constitution, that it should be producible 
"in a visible form." The period of time when the foundations of the present English Government were laid by the association 
of the people in "their original character" cannot, indeed, be ascertained. Many of the laws which are in use to this day in 
Great Britain, and from thence have been adopted by the American Republics, may be traced back to the remotest period of antiquity, 
and the origin even of the institution of Juries, an institution so congenial to the genuine spirit of freedom, is lost in the obscurity 
of the fabulous ages. Many of the fundamental principles of the English Constitution are known to have existed long before the 
invention of printing, and even before the inhabitants of Britain were acquainted with the use of letters, and it would therefore be 
an absurdity to require that the original articles should be produced "in a visible form." But "ex nihilo, nihilfit" the very existence 
of these principles proves the formation of a social compact previous to that existence, and the spirit of liberty, which is their 
distinguishing characteristic, affords internal evidence, that they did not originate in the merciless despotism of a conqueror, but in the 
free and unrestrained consent of a manly and generous people. It will not be said that an original compact was never formed, because 
it is not recorded in the page of history; as well might it be pretended that the pyramids of Egypt arose self-created from the 
earth, because the time of their erection, and the names of their builders have been consigned to that oblivion in which all human 
labors are destined to be overwhelmed. 
</p><p>
William of Normandy, to whom Mr. Paine always refers the 
origin of the English Government, was the conqueror only of 
Harold. He obtained the crown of England by popular election, 
upon the express condition that he would govern the nation accord 
ing to her ancient laws and customs ; he took the same oath at his 
coronation which had been taken by his predecessors, and by his 
last will, after bequeathing the province of Normandy to his eldest 
son Robert, he expressly acknowledged that he did not possess the 
kingdom of England as an inheritance, and only recommended his son William as his successor. It would be altogether unnecessary 
at this time to discuss the question whether the crown of England 
was originally hereditary or elective, but the facts which I have 
here stated, and which are warranted by all the most ancient and 
most authentic English historians, fully demonstrate that the 
English Government did not originate in the Norman conquest. 
"If the succession runs in the line of the conquest, the nation runs 
in the line of being conquered, and it ought to rescue itself from 
this reproach," says Mr. Paine. "The victory obtained at Hastings not being a victory over the nation collectively, but only over 
the person of Harold, the only right that the conqueror could 
pretend to acquire thereby, was the right to possess the crown 
of England, not to alter the nature of the Government" says Judge Blackstone (i Comm. 199). Upon a question of fact relative to 
the English Constitution, Blackstone is, I believe, as good an 
authority as Mr. Paine, but I wish not to rest the question upon 
any authority whatever : I venture to affirm, that any man who 
will coolly and impartially examine the subject, and appeal to the 
original sources of information, will acknowledge that those who 
derive the origin of the English Government from William the Con queror, can do it upon no other principle than that of supporting 
a system. 
</p><p>
It is not, however, necessary upon the present occasion to 
revive a question which has been discussed among the English with 
all the acrimony of faction. Mr. Paine has chosen the ground which 
was not found tenable by the slavish supporters of passive obedience 
and the divine right of Kings. They took it originally, because 
it was necessary to them for the support of their system, and 
they were driven from it by the friends and supporters of equal 
liberty. Mr. Paine found it necessary to support a doctrine of 
a very different nature ; and adopting the maxim, that it is lawful 
to learn, even from our enemies, he has freely borrowed from them 
the practice of accommodating the facts of history to his political purposes. 
</p><p>
Be that, however, as it may, the Parliament of Great Britain, from time to time, have enacted certain laws, which, from their 
superior importance, have been denominated Constitutional ; 
the acquiescence of the people, to whom most of these laws have 
been extremely satisfactory, gives them at least as good a sanction as the Constitution of France has obtained. The National 
Assembly were not originally chosen to form a Constitution. They were called together as States General, under the authority 
of another Constitution, such as it was. They assumed the power to dissolve the old Constitution, and to form another, and the ac 
quiescence of the people has confirmed their assumption. At all events, therefore, their Constitution stands upon no better 
ground than the acts of the British Parliament. 
</p><p>
If, then, the Parliament of Great Britain have a right to declare what shall be the supreme law of the land, they will be able to 
produce a system of Constitutional law, even according to Mr. Paine's wish, "in a visible form." This system is contained in a 
number of statutes, enacted not at one time, or by one body of men, but at divers times, according to the occasional convenience of the people, and by a competent authority. These statutes 
contain the principles upon which the English Government is founded, and are therefore proper objects of comparison with the 
Constitution which is to be the supreme law of the land in France. The comparisons which Mr. Paine has drawn are not partially 
favorable to his native country. We shall enquire whether they are perfectly consistent with truth. 
</p><p>
SIR, By the English Constitution, the whole collective power of the nation is delegated, and the Constitution itself is alterable 
by the same authority which is competent to the common purposes of legislation. 
</p><p>
The French are to have a Constitution, every part of which will be nominally beyond the control of their common legislatures, 
and which will be unalterable in all parts, except by the nation in its "original character." At least Mr. Paine has undertaken 
to answer for them that it will be so : although I have not seen any such article in the Constitution, and though perhaps it has not yet 
been decreed, I am willing to take Mr. Paine's word for the fact, and to consider the subject as if it were already determined. 
</p><p>
I have made some observations upon Mr. Paine's arguments, as they respect the right of a nation to delegate all their power. 
As a question of expediency, it may perhaps be more difficult to determine, which of these two schemes contains the least evil. 
Both of them are supported by the example of several among the American States, and can therefore boast the sanction of authorities equally respectable. 
</p><p>
The fundamental principle upon which society is formed appears 
to be, in order that the power of the whole may be rendered subservient to the interests of the whole. The problem to solve is, 
in what manner the power shall be distributed, so as most effectually to answer that purpose? Considering the extreme difficulty with which a whole nation can be brought to act in their 
original character, it should seem, that wisdom must dictate to them the necessity of delegating their whole power in such a 
manner as that it may be rendered beneficial to the nation, because whatever power is retained by the people, cannot be exercised 
for their advantage any more than to their injury. The question therefore occurs, why a nation should not delegate all its powers? 
Mr. Paine has bestowed very little consideration upon this subject; I find, that although he gives his own opinion very freely, he offers 
only two reasons to support it. One, because "such a Government would be arbitrary :" the other, because "there is a paradox 
in the idea of vitiated bodies reforming themselves." In the sense in which the word arbitrary is here used, the first argument 
attacks the foundation of civil society itself; for whenever a number of individuals associate together, and form themselves 
into a body politic, called a nation, the possession and the use of the whole power (which is not, however, arbitrary power) is the 
very object of their association. This power must exist some where, and I cannot see the reason why it should not exist for 
the benefit of the people. But whenever a Constitution is made unalterable by the common legislative authority, the nation do in 
reality abdicate all the powers which they are said to retain, and declare that very important powers shall at all events be useless 
to them, from an apprehension that they might possibly be abused to their injury. It is as if a man should bind himself never to wear 
a sword, lest he should turn it against his own breast. The only reason why the whole power of a nation should not be delegated, 
must arise from the danger of its being abused : and a melancholy experience has always shown, that when the whole power has been 
thus delegated to one man, or to one body of men, it has invariably been grossly abused, and the sword of the people has been turned 
into a dagger against them. From the pressure of those evils, many nations have been induced expressly to forbid their governments the use of certain powers, without considering that the impotence of their supreme authority would certainly be very 
prejudicial to them, and perhaps as fatal as the abuse of power. This experiment has repeatedly been made; it has frequently 
failed : and I believe, that after several more experiments shall fully demonstrate the ill policies of thus annihilating the power of 
the nation, it will be clearly seen, that all the powers of the people ought to be delegated for their benefit, and that their true interest 
consists in the distribution of those powers in such a manner as shall, in its own operation, guard against the abuses which alone are dangerous to the people. 
</p><p>
The Constitution of the United States appears to me to unite all the advantages, both of the French and of the English, while 
it has avoided the evils of both. By that Constitution, the people have delegated the power of alteration, by vesting it in the 
Congress, together with the State Legislatures; while at the same time it has provided for alterations by the people themselves in 
their original character, whenever it shall evidently appear to be the wish of the people to make them. This article appears to be 
replete with wisdom ; I believe it will stand the test of the severest examination, though, according to the ideas emanating from Mr. 
Paine, and coming to us, at the same time, by reflection from the Secretary of State, it contains a very dangerous political heresy. 
</p><p>
It is a maxim which will not, I trust, be disputed, that no Government, of which the people is not a constituent part, can 
secure their equal rights ; but where this is the case, to cramp the operations of their own Government with unnecessary restrictions, and forbid themselves to enact useful laws, what is it 
but to defeat the purposes of society by the very act which gives it a permanent existence ; to tie their own hands from an imaginary 
apprehension, that if left at liberty, they would administer poison to the body which nourishes them. 
</p><p>
It is in the distribution of the national powers, it is in the independent spirit of the people, and not in the manuscript limitations 
of the legislative authority, that a nation is to secure the protection 
of its liberties. In this commonwealth we have a Constitution, 
most parts of which are unalterable by our ordinary Legislatures ; 
it has existed but ten years : and already its operation has convinced us all, that several alterations in the system would be highly 
expedient. Our Legislative body would be fully competent to the purpose, and, if they had the power, would readily make such 
alterations as might suit the convenience of the people ; but they 
have no authority to act in these cases for the benefit of the people ; 
and as the inconveniences to which this injudicious jealousy has 
subjected us, are not at this time of such importance, as to render 
the alterations of immediate or absolute necessity, we must wait 
our appointed time, and patiently submit to the operation of bad 
laws, because we have not chosen to invest our Legislature with the 
power of making good ones. Let us not be frightened, however, 
from the pursuit of our common interest by the words arbitrary 
power. Distribute the whole of your power in such a manner, as 
will necessarily prevent any one man, or body of men, or any possible 
combination of individual interests, from being arbitrary, but do 
not incumber your own representatives with shackles, prejudicial to your own interests ; nor suffer yourselves, like the Spanish 
Monarch of ridiculous memory, to be roasted to death, by denying to your servants the power of removing the fire from before you. 
</p><p>
But although a Constitution, professedly unalterable by the common legislative authority, is of weight sufficient to prevent 
the enacting of many good laws, yet it will not always operate as a check upon your legislature. Such is the poverty of all human 
labors, that even a whole nation cannot express themselves upon paper with so much accuracy and precision, as not to admit of 
much latitude of explanation and construction. The Legislature must always be allowed to judge of the intentions with which the 
instrument was formed, and to construe and explain accordingly 
the expressions which it contains. They some times think proper 
to violate the letter of the Constitution by adhering to its spirit, 
and at other times they sacrifice the spirit by adhering strictly 
to the letter. But when your Legislature undertakes to decide 
that the spirit of the Constitution is directly contrary to its express 
letter, where is the power in the nation that should control them? 
The same power which will always be sufficient to control a Legislature, of which the people are a constituent part; it is the spirit 
of the people. Let your legislative and executive authorities be 
so constituted, as to prevent every essential, or dangerous abuse 
of the powers delegated, but depend upon the honest and en 
lightened spirit of the people for a security which you never will 
obtain, by merely withholding your powers, unless that spirit 
should be constantly kept up. Divide your power so that every 
part of it may at all times be used for your advantage, but in such 
a manner, that your rights may never depend upon the will of any 
one man or body of men ; entrust even the power of altering your 
Constitution itself, because occasion may arise, when the use even 
of that power may be absolutely necessary for your own welfare; 
when, at the same time, it may be impossible for you to act in your 
original character, with the expedition necessary for your salvation : 
but reserve to yourselves a concurrent power of altering the 
Constitution in your own persons, because by the decay to which all the works of man are liable, it is possible that your Legislature 
may become incompetent to make such alterations as may be necessary. But when the people are constantly represented in 
the Legislature, I believe they will never find it necessary to recur to their original character, in order to make any alterations, 
which they may deem expedient, unless they deny the power of making them to their Legislature. 
</p><p>
"But," says Mr. Paine, "there is a paradox in the idea of vitiated bodies reforming themselves." This must depend altogether upon the coincidence of the part vitiated with the part which 
is to apply the remedy ; for unless the defect itself necessarily precludes the possibility of applying the power of reformation, the 
paradox ceases, and no more involves an absurdity, than that a physician should use his own prescriptions to cure himself of a disorder. 
</p><p>
The very act by which septennial Parliaments were established 
in England, affords sufficient proof that the power of altering 
the constitution itself ought to be delegated, and even exercised 
by the Government upon certain critical occasions. That act 
was made at a time when the kingdom was threatened with an 
immediate invasion, when a rebellion had but just been quelled, and 
when the peace and safety of the nation depended upon the use of 
this power by the Parliament ; such was the opinion of the people 
at that time, and the act met with general approbation, from the 
general conviction of its necessity. Such occasions may happen in 
the history of every free people, and it is therefore proper that the 
power should be delegated. Upon the principles of equal liberty, 
upon the principles of public happiness, and therefore of political 
expedience, I think it may be fairly concluded, that Mr. Paine's 
preference of the French to the English constitution, so far as it 
relates to this article, is not founded in truth. 
</p><p>
Mr. Paine has undertaken to compare the English and French 
constitutions, upon the article of representation. He has of course 
admired the latter, and censured the former. This is unquestionably the most defective part of the English constitution, but even 
the most essential of these defects appear to flow from the natural 
order of things which a revolution in government could not reform ; 
from a state of society, when every principle of religion or of morality has lost its influence, and where the only shadow of virtue, public or private, remaining among a great majority of the people, 
is founded upon an imaginary point of honor, the relict of the 
exploded age of chivalry. Such at present is the situation of the 
national character both in England and in France. To attempt to 
govern a nation like this, under the form of a democracy, to pretend 
to establish over such beings a government which according to 
Rousseau is calculated only for a republic of Gods, and which 
requires the continual exercise of virtues beyond the reach of 
human infirmity, even in its best estate ; it may possibly be among 
the dreams of Mr. Paine, but it is what even the National Assembly have not ventured to do; their system will avoid some of the 
defects, which the decays of time and the mutability of human affairs have introduced into that of the English, but I do not 
hesitate to affirm that they have departed much further from the essential principles of popular representation, and that however their 
attachment to republican principles may have been celebrated, the theory of their National Assembly is more remote from the spirit of democracy than the practice of the English House of Commons. 
</p><p>
The ground upon which Mr. Paine acknowledges his approbation of the French constitution are that they have limited the number of their representatives, in proportion to the numbers of citizens 
justice to that pcntleman, and the publick, they are assured that he has no more concern in the publication, than the author of Rights of Man himself." Columbian 
who pay a tax of 60 sous per annum, and the duration of the 
assembly to two years. It is certainly essential to the principles 
of representation that there should be a frequent recurrence to the 
constituent body for election, because it is the only security of 
the constituent for the fidelity of the agent. It is the only practical 
responsibility by which the representative is bound. The term 
of seven years for which the House of Commons is elected, weakens 
the responsibility too much, and is a proper object of constitutional 
reform ; but by the French constitutions, there is no responsibility 
at all ; no connexion between the representative and his constituent : 
The people have not even once in seven years an opportunity to 
dismiss a servant who may have displeased them, or to re-elect 
another who may have given them satisfaction. There is upon 
the French system less dependence of the representative upon his 
constituent than in England, and the mode of election renders the 
biennial return of the choice almost wholly nugatory. It is 
not true that the French constitution allows the privilege of 
voting for a representative in the National Assembly to every man 
who pays a tax of 60 sous per annum. Mr. Paine has mistaken 
the fact, for it is impossible that he should have intentionally 
misrepresented it; though it differs almost as much from his 
principles as from those of a real popular representation. It 
is as follows. Every Frenchman born or naturalized, of 23 
years of age, who pays a tax equal to three days labor, is not a 
hired servant, nor a bankrupt, nor the son of a deceased bankrupt (a very unjust qualification), shall be allowed to vote for 
what? A representative to the National Assembly? By no 
means. Yet one would think the exclusions sufficiently severe, 
for a government founded upon the equal rights of all men ; but he 
shall vote for members of a certain assembly; this assembly is 
allowed to choose, not the representatives of the nation, but 
another body of electors, who are to be the immediate constituents 
of the legislative assembly. Thus the supreme legislative council 
of the nation, are to be the representatives of a representative body, 
whose constituents are the representatives of the people; and at every stage of this complicated representation, the free citizens 
of the state, are excluded from their natural rights, by additional qualifications in point of property. Yet this is the system which 
we are told is to abolish aristocracy. 
</p><p>
In the formation of the legislative body, the National Assembly contemplated three different objects of representation, the persons 
of the people, their property, and the territory which they inhabit : They have endeavored to establish a proportion compounded 
from the three, but in the refinement of their metaphysics and mathematics, they have lost the primary object itself, and the 
people are not represented. 
</p><p>
But setting aside their calculations, what is the essential principle upon which the representation of the people in the legislature is to be grounded? It is, that a Freeman shall never be 
bound by any law unless he has consented to it. It is impossible, 
except in a very small state, that every individual should personally give his voice, and therefore this practice of voting by representation was invented. In its most perfect state it cannot fully answer 
the purpose of its institution, because every representative is 
actuated by several powerful motives, which could not operate 
upon his constituents. It is an artificial democracy, which never 
can perform completely the functions of the natural democracy; 
but imperfect as it always must be, no other contrivance has been 
hitherto devised, which could so effectually give their operation 
to the opinions of the people. In the theory of representation it 
is a personal trust, by which a thousand individuals may authorise one man to express their sentiments upon every law which may be 
enacted for the benefit of the whole people : and therefore in 
theory every representative ought to be elected by the unanimous 
vote of his constituents ; for how can a man be said to have been 
consulted in the formation of a law, when the agent authorised to 
express his opinion was not the man of his choice? Every pecuniary 
qualification imposed either on the electors or as a condition of 
elegibility, is an additional restriction upon the natural democracy, 
and weakens the original purpose of the institution. Thus far the people of America have submitted to necessity in the constitution 
of their popular assemblies. But when the principle is abandoned so completely, that the individual citizen, even in the pretended 
exercise of his infinitesimal fragment of sovereignty cannot 
possibly form an opinion, who will be the elector of the representative that is to be the depositary of his opinion in the acts of legislation? The assembly thus formed may indeed assume the name 
of a democracy, but it will no more be entitled to the appellation than an ill drawn miniature portrait, to that of the animated 
original which it may profess to represent. 
</p><p>
It is obvious that the reason why the National Assembly have 
chosen to refine their representation through so many strainers 
was to avoid the violence, the tumults, the riots which render 
almost all the populous towns in England a scene of war and 
blood at the period of Parliamentary elections. Time alone will 
inform us what the success of their system will be, even in this 
particular. Their elections, however, must be extremely ex 
pensive, and must open a thousand avenues to every sort of 
intrigue and venality. The National Assembly as a body, will be 
in theory an aristocracy without responsibility. This aristocracy 
thus constituted are to possess the supreme power of the nation, 
limited only by a printed constitution subject to their own construction and explanation.

Happy, thrice happy the people of America ! whose gentleness of manners and habits of virtue are still sufficient to reconcile 
the enjoyment of their natural rights, with the peace and tranquillity of their country ; whose principles of religious liberty 
did not result from an indiscriminate contempt of all religion 
whatever, and whose equal representation in their legislative 
councils was founded upon an equality really existing among 
them, and not upon the metaphysical speculations of fanciful 
politicians, vainly contending against the unalterable course of 
events, and the established order of nature. 
</p><p>
From the existence of game laws and of monopolies in England, 
Mr. Paine infers the wisdom of the National Assembly, who have 
decreed, that there shall be none in France. I shall not defend 
the game laws or the monopolies allowed in England ; Mr. Paine's 
comparisons are made with the professed intention of showing the 
superiority of the French Constitution, and he has therefore always 
chosen his own ground of comparison. He might have pursued a 
system more consistent with truth and candor, but it would not 
have answered his purpose so effectually. The true drift of Mr. Paine's argument in this instance is this, The English Parliament 
have enacted game laws that operate unequally. They have allowed 
more monopolies than are advantageous to the people; therefore the 
Legislature of a nation ought not to have the poiver to make any lazes 
at all, relative either to game, or to monopolies. This is Mr. Paine's 
principle, and it is the real ground upon which he prefers the 
French Constitution, not merely to that of England, but to those 
of every State in the American union. He infers that the English 
Constitution is bad, because under that Constitution certain bad 
laws have been enacted, and are not yet repealed. And he concludes that the French Constitution is excellent, because the 
universal freedom of the chase, and the universal freedom of 
trade are placed beyond the control of their Legislature. But the 
preservation of game is an object of public concern, and the Legislature of every country ought to have the power of making game 
laws for the benefit of the public. Whether the English Parliament 
have exerted unwisely this power which has been delegated to 
them or not, is a question altogether foreign to the purpose ; we 
know that bad laws exist in every country under Heaven, but it is 
strange reasoning, to infer from thence, that there ought not to 
exist in the nation a power to make good ones. All the Legislatures 
in the United States have the power to enact game laws and to 
allow monopolies. They all of them exercise this power. We have game laws and monopolies in this Commonwealth, and yet no 
man complains that they are destructive to his liberty. If the 
French Constitution has placed the regulation of those objects 
beyond the reach of their ordinary legislative authority, they will 
soon find by their experiences of inconveniencies that the goodness 
of a Constitution does not depend upon the impotence of the Legislature. 
</p><p>
In examining the next article it is utterly impossible for me to do 
justice to the wit of Mr. Paine. The charge which he has so often 
repeated against Mr. Burke's book cannot be made against this 
production. You find here nothing of the "spouting rank of 
high-toned exclamation : " You do not even find the delicate 
sallies of elegant comedy. His own words must be quoted : 
"The French Constitution says, that to preserve the National 
representation from being corrupt, no member of the National 
Assembly shall be an officer of the government, a placeman or a 
pensioner. What will Mr. Burke place against this? I will 
whisper his answer : Loaves and Fishes " And then he proceeds 
to show that the answer which he whispers for Mr. Burke is 
very ridiculous. There is, it must be acknowledged, something 
pleasant in this mode of managing an argument; but it is rather 
unfortunate that Mr. Paine should complain as an abuse of the 
English government, that it is "themselves accountable to them 
selves," so near to a passage which is most assuredly "himself 
undertaking to answer himself." Every person will acknowledge 
that the answer of Loaves and Fishes is very absurd ; it is even too 
absurd for Mr. Burke in his original character; and the only 
circumstance that renders it perfectly accountable is, that it comes 
from Mr. Burke by his representative, who certainly never had 
from him any authority to misrepresent him so palpably. 
</p><p>
Mr. Paine has seldom thought proper to answer even the few 
arguments contained in the book which is so obnoxious to him : 
Easy as it might have been to refute Mr. Burke's reasoning, he 
probably thought it easier to refute his own : He has hunted for 
epigrams where he ought to have sought arguments : In the pursuit of those epigrams he has been sometimes not unsuccessful 
in exposing the absurdity of his own reasoning, but a less passionate or more generous political polemic, would not have chosen to 
place his own inconsistencies to the account of his antagonist. 
</p><p>
Mr. Paine has not however grounded his preference to the French Constitution upon truth, in this instance any more than in 
the other. The principle of excluding placemen, pensioners and executive officers from the national representation is acknowledged 
by the laws under the English Constitution as well as in that of France. The only possible advantage which the French can 
pretend to, is, that they have been more successful in its application. Mr. Paine might have said that it was not sufficiently 
extended by the English laws, and that it was by the French ; and his opinion would have had its weight; but this would not answer 
his purpose; the French Constitution must at all events have a triumph ; and a system so odious as the English government, was 
not entitled to the benefits of common truth and justice. There are however several acts of Parliament; expressly excluding a 
great variety of placemen, pensioners and officers dependent upon the executive authority, from holding seats in the House of 
Commons. With respect to pensioners their principle is more equitable than the total exclusion of the French. Every person 
holding a pension at the pleasure of the King, or for a term of years is excluded, because such a man may be too liable to be under 
the influence of the executive power; but if a man has received a pension for life, as a reward for services rendered his country, 
a pension which carries no dependence, and which can have no effect upon the legislative conduct of the person entitled to it, 
neither the English nor the Americans think that former services are a regular disqualification for the future; nor are they disposed 
to deprive any man of an invaluable privilege, merely because they have paid him for hazarding his life perhaps, or his fortune in their service. 
</p><p>
But, says Mr. Paine, by the English Constitution "those who vote the supplies are the same persons who receive the supplies 
when voted, and are to account for the expenditure of those supplies 
to those who voted them ; it is themselves accountable to them 
selves." This to be sure is very ingenious, but it is not in any 
sense true. The persons who vote the supplies are the House of 
Commons, the representatives of the nation : To them the King's 
ministers (and principally the Chancellor of the Exchequer) are 
accountable for the expenditure of the monies voted. The ministers 
may indeed be at the same time members of the House of Commons, 
and the system is perhaps defective in allowing a few individuals 
to be members of the body to whom they are accountable. It 
may be inconvenient, but is not at all absurd, and is purposely authorised by the English Constitution, because they con 
sider the advantages as more than a balance for its inconveniences. The minister of the supreme executive office, states 
to the representatives of the nation, the sums necessary to 
defray the annual expenses of the kingdom. These representatives vote the assessment of such sums as they think 
necessary, and make the appropriations. The ministers then 
become accountable for the expenditures according to the 
previous appropriations, to that body of which they are indeed 
individual members, but of which they do not compose an hundredth part. Upon what principle then are we told that it is 
themselves accountable to themselves? They have indeed in 
France taken great pains to secure the independence of the legislative upon the executive authority ; but they have not been 
equally cautious on the other side. Their executive is left totally at the mercy of the legislature, and must infallibly soon fall a sacrifice to their ambition. 
</p><p>
The discussion of this subject would lead me far beyond my 
present intention. I have shown that the Constitution of England 
has adopted the principle of excluding citizens dependent upon 
the executive power, from the House of Commons ; the French 
Constitution has done no more ; and if they have carried the appli 
cation of the principle further, that circumstance does not warrant 
the decided preference which Mr. Paine has so liberally bestowed : 
</p><p>
Since it is only a difference of opinion upon the expediency of 
particular exclusions. 
</p><p>
The next article upon which Mr. Paine has pronounced the 
superiority of the French Constitution, is upon the subject of 
making war and peace. The right, he says, is placed where the 
expense is, that is, in the nation : Whereas "in England, the right 
is said to reside in a metaphor, shown at the Tower for six pence 
or a shilling a piece." He answers himself again in this passage, 
and shows the folly of placing such a formidable right in a metaphor ; 
but in this instance as in the former, there is much wit and no 
truth; and I must take the liberty to affirm in contradiction to 
Mr. Paine, that the French Constitution has not, nor could not 
place the right of declaring war, where the expense must fall; 
and that the English Constitution has not placed this right in a 
metaphor. 
</p><p>
The expense of supporting wars must in all countries be defrayed 
by the nation, and every individual must bear his proportion of 
the burthen. In free countries that proportion must always be 
determined by the representatives of the people ; but the right of 
deciding when it may be expedient to engage in a war, cannot 
possibly be retained by the people of a populous and extensive 
territory, it must be a delegated power; and the French Constitution has vested it in the National Assembly. By the English 
Constitution it is vested in the supreme executive officer; but 
to guard against the abuse of this formidable power, it has given 
to the representatives of the people, the exclusive right of providing 
for the support of the war, and of withholding the supplies, "the 
sinews of war," if it should ever be declared contrary to the sense 
of the people themselves. Mr. Paine supposes a perplexity, which 
is warranted neither by theory nor by the experience of history. 
"If the one rashly declares war," says he, "as a matter of right; 
and the other peremptorily withholds the supplies as a matter of right, the remedy becomes as bad or worse than the disease." But 
every war in England must be the war of the people : The King is 
in reality no more than the organ of the nation, and must be more 
than an idiot to declare a war, upon which he must depend altogether upon them for its support, without being certain of that 
support. Imaginary conclusions drawn by reasoning against the 
inevitable order of things, are unworthy of a politician, and 
should be left as a feeble resource for the satirist. To have given 
his objection even an appearance of plausibility, Mr. Paine should 
have mentioned an instance, when this clashing of the rights of the 
King and of the Commons has ever been productive of the ill 
effects which his fancy has sagaciously drawn from them. 
</p><p>
Indeed Mr. Paine himself, upon further reflection, acknowledges 
the futility of his objection, and says "that in the manner the 
English nation is represented, it signifies not where this right 
resides, whether in the Crown or in the Parliament." But I 
apprehend, if the representation in England were as perfect as 
human wisdom could devise, their present system with respect 
to peace and war, would comprise all the advantages of the French 
system, and at the same time be free from many inconveniences, 
to which that must be liable. 
</p><p>
It must be clear to every one that the French have not, as Mr. Paine pretends, united the right and the expense: The impracticability of such an union, must be equally evident; and the only 
question which can establish a fair ground of comparison, between the two constitutions is, Whether it is expedient to delegate to the 
legislative, or whether to the executive authority, the right of declaring war. 
</p><p>
As I am not yet a convert to Mr. Paine's opinion that a nation has a right to do what it pleases, I must be allowed to say that they 
have a right to make war upon their neighbors, without provocation. 
The people by their representatives must judge, when the provocation is sufficient to dissolve them from all the obligations of morality and humanity, by which nations are bound to preserve the 
blessings of peace. But when they have determined that the 
great law of self-preservation, to which all other laws must give 
way, or that the laws which they have enacted in consequence of 
the primitive contract which united all their power for the benefit 
of every individual, compel them to appeal for justice to the God 
of battles, then, the declaration of war, the formal act, by which 
they announce to the world their intention to employ the arm of 
power in their own defence, seems to be the proper attribute of 
the executive power. The difference, therefore, between the 
English and French constitutions, considered in this light, can 
involve only a question of propriety, and as such the English 
appears to me to deserve the preference. 
</p><p>
If this idea should be considered as heretical, I must beg leave 
to call to my assistance the authority of Rousseau, a name still 
more respectable than that of Mr. Paine, because death has 
given the ultimate sanction to his reputation. "The act of 
declaring war," says he in his Social Compact, "and that of making 
peace, have been considered as acts of sovereignty, which is not 
the case; for either of those acts is not a law, but only an application of the law; a particular act which determines the operation 
of the law, as will be clearly perceived when the idea annexed 
to the word law shall be ascertained." The spirit of the English 
constitution is perfectly agreeable to this idea. 
</p><p>
But let us consider this subject a little further. Whenever a 
difference arises between two nations which may terminate in a 
war, it is proper and customary, that previous negotiations should 
be held, in order to use every possible means of settling amicably 
the dispute. These negotiations, the appointment of the agents 
by whom they are to be conducted, and the communication of the 
proposals for accommodation, which are respectively offered by 
either of the parties, are all appropriated to the executive department. When the restoration of peace becomes expedient in the 
opinion of the people, agents must again be appointed, and proposals of pacification must again be made. It is obvious to every 
man, that in the management of these concerns the utmost secrecy 
and despatch are frequently of essential necessity to the welfare of the people ; but what secrecy can ever be expected, when every 
instruction to an ambassador, every article of a proposed treaty, 
and every circumstance of information from the minister, in 
the progress of his operations, must be known to twelve hundred 
men assembled in the capital of the republic; what probability 
of despatch, when all these things must be debated in this Assembly of 200 men; where every thing must in the necessary 
order of events be opposed, by interested individuals and irritated 
factions, who may protract the discussion for months or years at 
their pleasure. 
</p><p>
By the Constitution of the United States, it is true, the right 
of declaring war is vested in the Congress, that is, in the legislative 
power. But it is in the point of form that it agrees with the 
Constitution of France ; it has wisely placed the management 
of all negotiations and treaties, and the appointment of all 
agents and ministers in the executive department; and it 
has so thoroughly adopted in this instance the principles 
of the English Constitution, that although it has given the 
Congress the right of declaring war, which is merely a difference of 
form, it has vested in the President, with the advice of the Senate 
as his executive council, the right of making peace, which is 
implied in that of forming treaties. This is not the first instance 
in which Mr. Paine's principles attack those of the constitutions 
of his country. Highly as we may revere, however, the principles 
which we are under every obligation to support, we may without 
irreverence acknowledge that they partake of the human imperfection from which they originated, and if Mr. Paine's principles 
in opposition to them, are in any instance founded upon eternal 
truth, we may indulge the hope, that every necessary improvement 
will be adopted in a peaceable and amicable manner by the general 
consent of the people. But if the principles of Mr. Paine, or 
those of the French National Assembly, would lead us by a vain 
and delusive pretence of an impracticable union, between the 
right of declaring, and the expense of supporting a war, to the 
sacrifice of principles founded in immutable truth, if they could 
persuade us, by establishing in the legislative body all negotiations 
with foreign nations relative to war and peace, to open a thousand 
avenues for base intrigue, for furious faction, for foreign bribery, 
and domestic treason, let us remain immoveably fixed at the 
banners of our constitutional freedom, and not desert the im 
pregnable fortress of our liberties, for the unsubstantial fabric 
of visionary politicians.

The papers under the signature of PUBLICOLA have called forth 
a torrent of abuse, not upon their real author nor upon the sentiments they express, but upon a supposed author, and supposed sentiments. 
</p><p>
With respect to the author, not one of the conjectures that have 
appeared in the public prints has been well grounded. The \ ice- 
President neither wrote nor corrected them ; he did not give his 
sanction to an individual sentiment contained in them, nor did 
they "go to the press under the assumed patronage of his son." 
</p><p>
With respect to the sentiments, to those who have read the pieces with attention, it is needless to say, that they are simply 
an examination of certain principles and arguments contained in a late pamphlet of Mr. Paine s, which are supposed to be 
directly opposite to principles acknowledged by the constitutions of our country. And the author challenges all the writers 
who have appeared in support of Mr. Paine's infallibility, to produce a single passage to these publications which has the most 
distant tendency to recommend either a monarchy or an aristocracy to the citizens of these States. 
</p><p>
The writer never had the intention to defend the corruptions of the English Constitution ; nor even its principles in theory, 
except such as were adopted in our own. Mr. Paine has drawn 
a comparison between certain parts of the English and French 
constitutions, in which are contained principles of government, 
that are not acknowledged by our own constitutions. So far as 
the principles of the English Constitution have been adopted by 
the Americans, I have defended them, and I am firmly convinced, 
that we cannot renounce them, without renouncing at the same time 
the happy governments with which we are favored. The question 
of superiority between the French and English constitutions, has 
no connection with a question relative to monarchy. If this be 
true, it must apply equally to the admirers of the French Constitution, and Mr. Paine himself is chargeable with having supported a 
monarchical institution. It is well known that by the French 
Constitution, a standing army of near 300,000 men is established, and placed beyond the annihilating arm of legislature. 
Is it possible that Mr. Paine should admire this Constitution, with 
out being a friend to standing armies? The argument is the same, 
and the assertion might be made, with just as much truth, as that 
PUBLICOLA is an advocate for monarchy or for aristocracy. 
</p><p>
When Mr. Paine says that a whole nation (by which it is admitted that he means a majority of the nation) have a right to 
do what it chooses, and when he says that before the formation 
of civil society every man has a natural right to judge in his own 
cause, it appears to me that he resolves all right into power; it 
is this opinion which I have combated, because it appears to me 
to be of the most pernicious tendency, and if it is not really contained in the pamphlet, I confess myself greatly mistaken. 
But the enlightened writers, who have defended the principles of 
Mr. Paine, differ so essentially in the ground they have taken, 
that the one or the other would certainly have been charged with 
propagating detestable heresies, had not the end sanctified the 
means, and the object of defending Mr. Paine, reconciled the 
inconsistency of their reasonings. One writer supports the principle through thick and thin; and tells you that the will of the 
contracting parties is the only circumstance that makes treaties 
obligatory. Another tells you that I have grossly misrepresented 
Mr. Paine, and that the national omnipotence which he establishes relates only to the internal concerns of the community. He 
agrees, however, that the will of the majority must be taken for 
the will of the whole nation, and that with respect to the formation of a government, a majority have a right to do what they 
please. So that it is no longer the "rights of men," but the rights 
of the majority which alone are unalienable. 
</p><p>
Upon the question whether a constitution government can 
be made alterable otherwise than by the people in their original 
character, I have defended the Constitutions of the United States 
against the principle of Mr. Paine, though in the republication 
of the paper in several of the southern papers, the passage which 
supports my opinion by the authority of the Constitution, is 
omitted. 
</p><p>
Upon the article of representation, I have contended that the 
French representation is no representation of the people at all. 
Is there a man in the United States who would recommend it as a 
model to us? I have contended that our representation of the 
people is infinitely superior both to the French and the English ; 
and this is said to be an abominable heresy. 
</p><p>
Upon the subject of monopolies, of game laws, and of exclusions 
from the legislature, I have defended the principles adopted by our 
own constitutions, and not the abuses of the English Government. 
Upon that of war and peace I have done the same, and wherein Mr. Paine's observations have appeared to be founded upon any other 
foundation than truth, I have endeavored to show their fallacy. 
But a defence of monarchy or aristocracy was no more in my intention, than the defence of the Salic Law of descents was to that of 
Mr. Paine. 
</p><p>
I shall now conclude these papers with requesting that those 
only who read them would judge upon their principles ; and 
I am well persuaded, that the candour of the public will not take 
misrepresentation for reason, nor invective for argument.
