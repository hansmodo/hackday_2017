My Dear Friend. 
</p><p>
The people of this city are become wonderfully fond of the 
King, and have a thorough contempt for the Assembly, who 
are, in general, what used to be called in Philadelphia, the blue 
stockings. There is, however, this difference between the 
two capitals, that with you virtuous poverty is respected, but 
here splendor is indispensable. Judge the consequence, and 
to enlighten that judgment, know that at this moment they 
stand on the brink of bankruptcy, which can only be avoided 
by increasing the vigor of the executive magistrate. This 
becomes daily more and more apparent ; and Paris exists, as 
it were, on the interest of the national debt. 
These facts will enable you to understand, why the other 
evening at the Italian comedy, as it is called, the parterre, or 
people, cried out continually Vive le Roy; Vive la Heine; 
Vive, la famille royale. Sire, vive votre Majeste. These 
words, Sire and JWajeste, were, you know, proscribed by the 
Assembly, which was obliged, by a strong expression of the 
popular sentiment, to retract that decree the very next day. 
A patriot, in the midst of this acclamation, took it into his 
head to cry Vive la Nation, but the rest silenced him immediately. 
</p><p>
Now, my dear friend, this is the very same people who, 
when the King was brought back from his excursion, whipped 
a democratical Dutchess of my acquaintance, because they 
heard only the last part of what she said, which was, 11 nefaut 
pas dire, vive le Roi. She had the good sense to desire the 
gentleman, who was with her, to leave her. Whipping is, you 
know, an operation which a lady would rather undergo among 
strangers, than before her acquaintance. 
</p><p>
The provinces are not as yet in the same disposition with 
the capital, and I think they will not be so for a long time to 
come. But accidents may happen to change either the one 
or the other, and it is difficult to decide with precision on a 
people and situation so fluctuating and inconstant. I am, &ic.
