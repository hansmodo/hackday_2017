Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to send you herewith, the copies of two 
judgments, rendered with regard to the American vessel, the 
George. By the first, the tribunal, in conforming itself to the 
treaty of <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, declared her unlawful prize; but by the secondj a part of the cargo is condemned, as hostile property ; 
and the tribunal has founded its decision upon the decree of 
the twenty-seventh of July. 
</p><p>
Captain Richard Stevens, of the American vessel, the 
Hope, also complains very bitterly of a sentence rendered lately against a part of the cargo of this vessel, which is incontestably American property. This captain informs me, that the 
tribunal of St Brieu has founded its decision on the circumstance, that in the invoice, the owners of the vessel had added 
their commission to the price of the articles therein comprised ; 
a thing in use among merchants, who by this means insuring 
the whole shelter from maritime danger, the price of their 
labor, as they do that of their merchandizes. I do not cite, 
Sir, this sentence in the form of a complaint, first, because 
I have not yet received an authentic copy of it, and above all, 
because I am persuaded that the superior tribunal, to whom an 
appeal must be made, will not fail to render justice. 
</p><p>
I desire only to let you see, Sir, how much discontent the 
execution of the decree of the 27th of July must excite. 
</p><p>
Persuaded that the Convention wishes to maintain the closest connexions between our two Republics, I have given to 
our Ministry the most positive assurances of it ; but they will be contradicted by the injured persons, who doubtless will accuse the Minister with supineness, who does not adopt the feelings of his fellow citizens ; and my efforts will fail of their effect, as soon as it can be imagined, that I do not render a faithful account of the dispositions of the French Republic, from 
the want of intelligence or exactness. 
</p><p>
I request you, Sir, to pardon an observation which regards 
the particular interests of France. The circumstances of the 
moment prevent the fitting out of privateers, consequently, it 
would cost her nothing to cause the treaty to be observed with 
the greatest exactitude. Then the contrast, which the Americans would make between the conduct of France, and that of 
her enemies, could not but be favorable ; but at present, on the 
contrary, every time we complain of the conduct of the English, they shut our mouths by this decree of the 27th of July. 
Nothing is more embarrassing for our Minister at London, and 
nothing can be more injurious to the French Republic, in the 
opinion of the neutral powers. 
</p><p>
I hope, Sir, that you will observe in the freedom of the observations I have just made to you, the amicable and fraternal 
dispositions, which have dictated them. I am sure, at least, of 
conforming to the views of the United States, in following my 
own inclination, to remove everything that might change the 
good harmony, which exists between two nations, allied as well 
by the force of sentiment, as by that of treaties. I have the 
honor to be, &tc.
