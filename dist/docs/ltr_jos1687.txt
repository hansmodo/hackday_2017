Dear Brother: ... It is now becoming extremely important to know precisely what <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant</a> wants in connection with the Presidency. If he has really made up his 
mind that he would like to hold that office, he can have it. 
Popular opinion is all in his favor. His position is the 
rare one of having that office within his easy reach, and 
yet it is clear that his interest is against his acceptance. 
The moment he is nominated, he at once becomes the 
victim of abuse ; and even his great services will not 
shield him. Our politics for years will be a maelstrom, 
destroying and building up reputations with rapidity. 
My conviction is clear that Grant ought not to change 
his present position to that of President ; and if he declines, then by all odds Chase is the safest man for the 
country. He is wise, politic, and safe. Our finances, the 
public credit, and the general interests of all parts of 
the country will be safe with him. His opinions are advanced on the suffrage question, but this waived, he 
would be a most conservative President. He is not a 
partisan, scarcely enough so for his own interests ; still, 
if Grant wishes to be President, all other candidates will 
have to stand aside. I see nothing in his way unless he 
is foolish enough to connect his future with the Democratic party. This party cannot dictate the next President. They would deaden any man they praise. Even 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">Grant</a> could not overcome any fellowship with them. If 
they should take a wise course on future political questions, their course during the war will bar their way. 
You may not think so, but I know it. The strength is 
with the Republicans. Not of the Butler stripe, but 
with just that kind of men who would be satisfied with 
the position of Grant. The suffrage and reconstruction 
questions will be settled before the election, and in such 
a way as to secure the Republican party an even chance 
in every Southern State except Kentucky. . . .

I agree with you that Indian wars will not cease until 
all the Indian tribes are absorbed in our population, and 
can be controlled by constables instead of soldiers.

I mean to remain as quiet as possible this fall. I am 
not now in high favor with the Radicals, and can afford 
to wait awhile. The election in Ohio will go as usual. 
The suffrage amendment will be adopted by a close vote, 
and that will settle forever the negro question in Ohio. 
A reaction and struggle may occur in the South, but no 
change will occur in the loyal States until they decide on 
financial questions. This is inevitable after the next 
election. . . .

Affectionately yours,
