DEAR SIR, At the date of my last, I expected I should by 
this time have been on the journey which promises the pleasure 
of taking you by the hand in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. Several circumstances 
have produced a delay in my setting out which I did not calculate upon, and which are like to continue it for eight or ten 
days to come. My journey will also be rendered tedious by the 
route which I shall pursue. I have some business which makes 
it expedient for me to take Winchester and Lancaster in my 
way, and some duties of consanguinity which will detain me 
some days in the neighborhood of the former. If I have an opportunity I will write you again before I set out; and if I should 
not, I will do it immediately on my reaching <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. You 
will not write after the receipt of this. 
</p><p>
I imagine you get from Mr. Jones better information as to 
the back country, as well as concerning our more immediate affairs, than I can give you. The death of Christian seems to be 
confirmed. The disinclination of Kentucky to a separation is 
also repeated with strong circumstances of probability. Our 
staple continues low. The people have got in debt to the merchants, who set their own price, of course. There are, perhaps, 
other causes also, besides the fall of the market in Europe, 
which, of itself, does not explain the matter. One of them may 
be the scarcity of money, which is really great. 
</p><p>
The advocates for paper money are making the most of this 
handle. I begin to fear exceedingly that no efforts will be sufficient to parry this evil. The election of Col. Mason is the 
main counterpoise for my hopes against the popular cry. Mann 
Page and General Nelson will also, I flatter myself, be valuable 
fellow-labourers. Our situation is truly embarrassing. It cannot, perhaps, be affirmed that there is gold and silver enough 
in the Country to pay the next tax. What, then, is to be done? 
Is there any other alternative but to emit paper, or to postpone 
the collection? These are the questions which will be rung in 
our ears by the very men whose past measures have plunged us 
into our difficulties. But I will not plague you with our difficulties here. You have enough of them, I am sure, where you 
are. Present my best respects to Col. Grayson and your other 
colleagues, and believe me to be, your's affectionately. 
</p>
