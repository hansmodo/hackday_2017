After being nearly becalmed, with the sails flapping against the masts, a fair wind has sprung up and we are making direct for the Strait of Le Mair, which separates Staten Land or Island from Tierra del Fuego. But not having reached the point wished for at sunset, the Captain has determined to pass around to the east of Staten Island. At six o'clock P.M. we were 36 miles from land. All eyes were eagerly directed shoreward, many asserting that they could discover it. Some said they had a very indistinct view of what they supposed to be a small mountain on Staten Island.

We are in the vicinity of whales. For several hours, while the sea was smooth, we were literally surrounded by whales, some of them of enormous size. Three came within a few feet of the vessel, giving us a good view of them, the largest of which would measure at least forty feet and perhaps sixty or more. To us landsmen it was a pleasing sight, and notwithstanding that we had all read and heard of their vast size, we were all thrown aback and filled with surprise, the largest elephants turning into mere pigmies when compared to these
monsters of the deep. A magnificent sight was presented to viewabout a dozen in one school, a few hundred yards apart, kept spouting large volumes of water into the air, one after the other in quick succession, making it resemble the continued puffing of a steam car in motion. At twilight this evening the huge carcass of one floated by; and then a question arose, the Captain supposing it dead, and the first mate maintaining it was only sleeping.

While sitting on the bow of the vessel, I observed various miniature rainbows reflected in the water, caused by the bright sun striking the spray as it dashed from the bow of the ship. We have not seen any flying fish for some time, nor will we until we have warmer weather, for as cold weather approaches they disappear. We were again greeted with seaweed, the first we have seen in latitude 18 deg. N., I think, although of a different species, being a vine with long, broad leaves upon it.

Last night a party of the "owlers" made fire in the stove which the Captain had purposely extinguished, and cooked sundry dainty dishes. But they were disturbed and nearly discovered by the unexpected appearance of the Captain, some of them having to decamp with various baggage under their coats.
