HERMITAGE RANCHO, January 1 st, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1852">1852</a>
</p><p>
I wish you a happy New Year and you may consider yourself kissed. Now, what apology shall I make for neglecting you so long. Since the 15th of May I have not written a word to the States. I received a letter from you dated July 20th and that is my latest advises from home. I have been daily looking for a notice in the papers inquiring for the whereabouts of a young man about my size but now I will set your mind at rest.
</p><p>
I am at present here with Cole. He and Lindley have dissolved and divided the farm after a great deal of trouble. Lindley is the County Clerk and Recorder elect of Yuba County, an office worth $10,000 per year in this State. On account of his spending so much money and time to get this office, was the cause of the difficulty with Cole. They wrote me to come down from Downieville
and help settle their affairs. This accounts for my leaving the mines and being here.
</p><p>
Well, when I arrived the two men were at bay. Lindley had vamosed the ranch and was living in Marysville. They could not speak with each other. I was appointed an ambassador extraordinary on the part of Cole to meet the enemy and make terms. I have accomplished this and the whole thing is settled. Cole retains all the property and 540 acres of land. Lindley has the rest of the rancho.
</p><p>
Since I wrote you on the 15th of May, last I have been in Downieville, 80 miles above Marysville, at the forks of the Yuba. I have been at work in the mines. My health has been excellent; my food: beef steaks and bread; but my success? That is the question. Had I made some thousands I should take great pleasure in describing to you the operation of mining, the mode of life, etc., but as it is, I will refer you to Father's letter and to the lament I send you enclosed. It hits my case exactly. For some reason I am not permitted to accumulate any of that substance called: GOLD. Further than enough to live comfortably, I have never been dead broke and owe nothing in this country, on the contrary I have a great deal of money and favours due me and have always fed well and dressed to suit my taste, but these big stakes that some make are denied me.
</p><p>
Now, I am particularly anxious to make $2,000 to pay all my debts. I thought this past summer I could do it and I have tried hard from early morn till dewy eve for five months. I have laboured hunting after gold and when I got through I had $100. Less than when I began. Now, is not this rather hard luck? What have I done? What sins have I committed to be visited with such luck? But I am as light hearted as ever and do not despair of being able to come out all right in the end. The gold is not all dug out yet.
</p><p>
Downieville is one of the richest mining towns in the State. Upwards of $2,000,000 has been dug there this season by some three or four thousand men. The last 50 miles of the way to Downieville is only a mule trail, no wagons are seen in the streets, everything is packed and yet in this 'hole in the ground' as it is called, you will find two hundred buildings, two saw mills, a theatre and all the necessaries of life and cheap, too, for this country. Downieville is only 20 miles from the summit of the Sierra Nevada which is covered with snow the year round.
</p><p>
The climate was truly delightful last summer, but the winter is very much like Maine. Before I left it was very cold and on the 20th of November we had an old fashioned snow storm. It all melted, however, the next day. Now, come down into this valley of the Yuba, 75 miles from Downieville to where I am writing today and look at the country. We have had some heavy rains lately and the 'fields stand dressed in living green.' The farmers are ploughing. Everything is as forward as in May with you, so you, so you see we can have any kind of a climate we choose in this glorious country.
</p><p>
I have been at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=sacramento">Sacramento</a> City since I came down. Our house is rented to two Frenchmen and called the Eureka. We rent it now for $100 per month and Cole has been cheated of all the rent this summer but the last two months principally by a female: Mrs. Johnson, who vamosed leaving rent unpaid as usual. I tried this time to collect something but Mrs. Johnson is living in furnished apartments and has nothing of her own that I could attach. O woman, woman! They tell about men losing all honor, and self-respect when they arrive in this country! This is in some measure true but in regard to women it's certainly holding good. All that keeps them up at home is the rules of society. No sooner do they get
out of that restraint than they show out their natural dispositions. Among men, some few retain all their principles in this country and are the same here as at home, but of all the women of my acquaintance there is none, no, not one. But society is improving in some respects. Gentlemen are not seen in gambling saloons as formerly, banking at monte. Nor is it considered hardly respectable to be seen riding out sunday with a Mexican Senorita but there are a good many things yet to be reformed but they will all be accomplished in time.
</p><p>
Sacramento is the most like home to me of any place in this country and it is the prettiest city and the most orderly in the State. By the number of ladies and children I saw at church and in the streets I should think there must be a great many families there. I saw all my old friends and had a very pleasant visit.
</p><p>
Oh, that I were in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=New York">New York</a> today. That is the place to spend New Years, but I am afraid I should find but few of my friends. I am going up to call on Mrs. Lindley this evening. She is the only lady I know of.
</p><p>
Died on the 24th inst our beautiful blood mare: Jenny Lind, one that I purchased in Carson Valley for $16 and Cole could have taken $300 for her at one time but asked $500. It never rains but it pours.
