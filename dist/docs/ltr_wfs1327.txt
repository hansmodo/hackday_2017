<p></p>
DEAR SIR: 
<p></p>
I have been waiting for an evening's leisure to 
answer your letter before me, and, after an unreasonable delay, am at last obliged to reply in the midst of 
official occupations. 
 
<p></p>
That I ever have been named in connection with 
the Presidency of the United States, has not, I can as 
sure you^ the son of an ancient neighbor and friend, 
been by any contrivance or desire of mine ; and certainly I shall never be in the field for that high office 
unless placed there ly a regular nomination. Not, 
then, being a candidate, and seeing 110 near prospect 
of being made one, I ought, perhaps, to decline troubling you or others with my humble opinions on great 
principles of State Rights and Federal Administration ; 
but as I cannot plead ignorance of the partiality of a 
few friends, in several parts of the Union, who may, by 
possibility, in a certain event, succeed in bringing me 
within the field from which a Whig candidate is to be 
selected, I prefer to err on the side of frankness and 
candor, rather than, by silence, to allow any stranger 
unwittingly to commit himself to my support. 
<p></p>
Your inquiries open the whole question of domestic slavery, which has, in different forms, for a number 
of years, agitated Congress and the country. 
<p></p>
Premising that you are the first person who has 
interrogated me on the subject, I give you the basis of 
what would be my reply in greater detail, if time allowed 
and the contingency alluded to above were less remote. 
<p></p>
In boyhood, at William and Mary College, and in 
common with most, if not all, my companions, I became deeply impressed with the views given by Mr. Jefferson, in his "Notes on Yirginia," and by Judge 
Tucker, in the Appendix to his edition of Blackstone s 
Commentaries, in favor of a gradual emancipation of 
slaves. That Appendix I have not seen in thirty odd 
years, and, in the same period, have read scarcely any 
thing on the subject; but my early impressions are 
fresh and unchanged. Hence, if I had had the honor 
of a seat in the Virginia Legislature in the winter of 
1831- ? 2, when a bill was brought forward to carry out 
those views, I should certainly have given it my hearty 
support. 
<p></p>
I suppose I scarcely need say that, in my opinion, 
Congress has no color of authority, under the Constitution, for touching the relation of master and slave with 
in a State. 
<p></p>
I hold the opposite opinion in respect to the 
District of Columbia. Here, with the consent of the 
owners, or on the payment of "just compensation," 
Congress may legislate at its discretion. But my con 
viction is equally strong that, unless it be step by step 
with the Legislatures of Yirginia and Maryland, it 
would be dangerous to both races in those States to 
touch the relation between master and slave in this 
District. 
<p></p>
I have from the first been of opinion that Congress 
was bound by the Constitution to receive, to refer, and 
to report upon petitions relating to domestic slavery as 
in the case of all other petitions ; but I have not failed 
to see and to regret the unavoidable irritation which 
the former have produced in the Southern States, with 
the consequent peril to the two colors, whereby the 
adoption of any plan of emancipation has everywhere 
among us been greatly retarded. 
<p></p>
I own, myself, no slave ; but never have attached 
blame to masters for not liberating their slaves well 
knowing that liberation, without -the means of sending 
them in comfort to some position favorable to " the pursuit of happiness," would, in most cases, be highly inju 
rious to all around, as well as to the manumitted families themselves unless the operation were general and 
under the auspices of prudent legislation. But I am 
persuaded that it is a high moral obligation of masters 
and slaveholding States to employ all means, not in 
compatible with the safety of both colors, to meliorate 
slavery even to extermination. 
<p></p>
It is gratifying to know that general melioration 
has been great, and is still progressive, notwithstanding the disturbing causes alluded to above. The more 
direct process of emancipation may, no doubt, be earlier 
commenced and quickened in some communities than 
in others. Each, I do not question, has the right to 
judge for itself, both as to time and means, and I consider interference or aid from without, except on invi 
tation from authority within, to be as hurtful to the 
sure progress of melioration, as it may be fatal to the 
lives of vast multitudes of all ages, sexes, and colors. 
The work of liberation cannot be forced without such 
horrid results. Christian philanthropy is ever mild 
and considerate. Hence all violence ought to be deprecated by the friends of religion and humanity. Their 
persuasions cannot fail at the right time to free the 
master from the slave, and the slave from the master ; 
perhaps before the latter shall have found out and 
acknowledged that the relation between the parties 
had long been mutually prejudicial to their worldly 
interests. 
<p></p>
There is no evil without, in the order of Providence, some compensating benefit. The bleeding 
African was torn from his savage home by his ferocious neighbors, sold into slavery, and cast upon this 
continent. Here, in the mild South, the race has 
wonderfully multiplied, compared with anything ever 
known in barbarous life. The descendants of a few 
thousands have become many millions ; and all, from 
the first, made acquainted with the arts of civilization, and, above all, brought under the light of the 
Gospel. 
<p></p>
From the promise made to Abraham, some two 
thousand years had elapsed before the advent of our 
Saviour, and the Israelites, the chosen people of God, 
were, for wise purposes, suffered to remain in bondage 
longer than Africans have been on our shore. This 
race has already experienced the resulting compen 
sations alluded to; and, as the white missionary has 
never been able to penetrate the dark regions of Africa, 
or to establish himself in its interior, it may be within 
the scheme of Providence that the great work of spread 
ing the Gospel over that vast continent, with all the 
arts and comforts of civilization, is to be finally accomplished by the black man restored from American 
bondage. A foothold there has already been gained 
for him, and in such a scheme centuries are but as 
seconds to Him who moves worlds as man moves a finger. 
<p></p>
I do but suggest the remedies and consolations 
of slavery, to inspire patience, hope, and charity on all 
sides. The mighty subject calls for the exercise of all 
man s wisdom and virtue, and these may not suffice 
without aid from a higher source. 
<p></p>
It is in the foregoing manner, my dear sir, that I 
have long been in the habit, in conversation, of express 
ing myself, all over our common country, on the question of negro slavery, and I must say that I have found 
but very few persons to differ with me, however opposite their geographical positions. 
<p></p>
Such are the views or opinions which you seek. 
I cannot suppress or mutilate them, although now 
liable to be more generally known. Do with them 
what you please. I neither court nor shun publicity. 
I remain, very truly, yours, 
<p></p>
