MY DEAR MADAM, In the present state of alarm and bustle of preparation 
for the worst that may happen, I imagine it will be more convenient to dispense 
with the enjoyment of your hospitality to day, and, therefore, pray you to admit this 
as an excuse for Mr. Jones, Lucy, and myself. Mr. Jones is deeply engaged in 
dispatching the marines and attending to other public duties. Lucy and I are packing, with the possibility of having to leave; 
but in the event of necessity we know not where to go, nor have we any means yet 
prepared for the conveyance of our effects. I sincerely hope and trust the necessity 
may be avoided, but there appears rather serious cause of apprehension. Our carriage horse is sick, and our coachman absent, or I should have called last evening 
to see your sister. I feel great solicitude on her account. Yours very truly and affectionately, 
</p><p>
E. JONES.
