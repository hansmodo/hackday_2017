                      To W. D. Howells, in Boston:
</p><p>
HARTFORD, May 5, '85.
</p><p>
MY DEAR HOWELLS,--.....Who taught you to read?  Observation and thought,
I guess.  And practice at the Tavern Club?--yes; and that was the best
teaching of all:
</p><p>
Well, you sent even your daintiest and most delicate and fleeting points
home to that audience--absolute proof of good reading.  But you couldn't
read worth a damn a few years ago.  I do not say this to flatter.  It is
true I looked around for you when I was leaving, but you had already
gone.
</p><p>
Alas, Osgood has failed at last.  It was easy to see that he was on the
very verge of it a year ago, and it was also easy to see that he was
still on the verge of it a month or two ago; but I continued to hope--but
not expect that he would pull through.  The Library of Humor is at his
dwelling house, and he will hand it to you whenever you want it.
</p><p>
To save it from any possibility of getting mixed up in the failure,
perhaps you had better send down and get it.  I told him, the other day,
that an order of any kind from you would be his sufficient warrant for
its delivery to you.

In two days <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=usg" rel="colleague met">General Grant</a> has dictated 50 pages of foolscap, and thus the
Wilderness and Appomattox stand for all time in his own words.  This
makes the second volume of his book as valuable as the first.
</p><p>
He looks mighty well, these latter days.

                                        </p>
                                                  MARK.
