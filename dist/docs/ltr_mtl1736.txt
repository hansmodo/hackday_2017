MY DEAR <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ezk" rel="met friend">LIZZIE</a> : Bowed down with suffering and anguish, again I write you. As we 
might have expected, the Republicans are falsifying me, and doing just as they did when they 
prevented the Congressional appropriation. Mrs. - knows something about these same people. 
As her husband is living they dare not utter all they would desire to speak. You know yourself 
how innocently I have acted,- and from the best and purest motives. They will hovd on to prevent my disposing of my things. What a vile, 
vile set they are! The Tribune here, Mr. White's paper, wrote a very beautiful editorial yesterday 
in my behalf; yet knowing that I have been deprived of iny rights by the party, I suppose 
I would be mobbed if I ventured out. What a world of anguish this is and how I have been 
made to suffer! * * * You would not recognize me now. The glass shows me a pale, 
wretched, haggard face, and my dresses are 
like bags on me. And all because I was doing what I felt to be my duty. Our minister, 
Mr. Swazey, called on me yesterday and said I had done perfectly right. Mrs. F says every one speaks in the same way. The politicians, 
knowing they have deprived me of my just rights, would prefer to see me starve, rather than 
dispose of my things. They will prevent the sale of anything, so I have telegraphed for them. 
I hope you have received from B. the letters I have consigned to his care. See to this. Show 
none of them. Write me every day.
