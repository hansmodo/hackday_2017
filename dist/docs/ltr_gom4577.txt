Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am to reply to three of your letters. Probably I shall 
make my answer as long as all three of them, and thus in 
quantity at least be even with you. For the rest, we must 
take our chance, because when I take up my pen, I know no 
more what I am going to write, than you will in breaking the 
seal what your are going to read. 
</p><p>
Before all things I am reminded as I go along, that this 
day, the birthday of our republic, demands our filial acknowledgments. A day now at length auspicious, since by the 
establishment of our new constitution we have the fair prospect of enjoying those good things, for which we have had so 
hard a contest. Indulge, I pray you, the effusion of my heart, 
which gratulates itself on this occasion. Feel, with me, the 
transports which I cannot but feel, when every letter from 
America brings confirmation of the public happiness, and 
announces some additional cement to our national union, or 
some useful exhibition of national authority. The opposition sickens with mortal symptoms, and I hope and trust, that 
our countrymen will have the wisdom to wait, before they 
attempt amendments, for those lights of experience, which are 
the only guides that can pretend to infallibility. 
</p><p>
You will find herein a letter from our friend Robert Morris 
to you, which he left open by way of saving himself the trouble of writing to me the public occurrences. In that letter he 
announces a fact, which we have received from other quarters 
with some details, that the House of Representatives have 
resolved to submit the principal direction of the finances to a 
single man. Through this measure I can feel the pulse of 
our government. It is vigorous beyond my hopes, far beyond 
my expectations, and comes up to my wishes. It is the vigor 
of administration, which can alone consolidate recent establjshments. The mass of a nation will always judge rightly of 
their rulers, by the effects of their measures, although they can 
never, penetrate into the nature of the measures themselves. 
From the fruit we know the tree, without pretending to investigate the botanical mysteries of vegetation. The extent of 
our country, and the deliberative freedom of its legislative authority, require an active and vigorous executive. Every 
subordinate power should be tied to the chief, by those inter 
mediate links of will and pleasure, which, like the elasticity of 
the arterial system, render sensible the pulsations of the heart 
at the remotest extremities. For how can the executive be 
accountable, when its members are not subordinate and obedient to the general volition ? But where am I going ? I 
shall, ere I am aware of it, convert a letter of friendship into 
a political essay. But so it is, that if once the ideas get into 
that beaten track, where they have been used to travel, they 
go on, like old cart-horses, with the most determined obstinacy imaginable. 
</p><p>
July 10th. 
</p><p>
You ask me if Mr Jefferson is gone to America. He is 
not, but is ready to depart at a moment's warning, having 
staid here some time expecting to receive his conge by every 
opportunity, but is still in the same expectation. I conclude, that ft will not be expedited, until the arrangement of the 
ministerial departments shall have been completed. It occurs 
to me, while I write, that probably the secretary of foreign 
affairs will decline acting, until appointed under the new 
government, for which I can perceive many reasons. It 
might, for instance, be construed into presumption. It is 
probable, also, that the question of the conge will not be 
agitated, till another question is determined, viz. who shall act 
here in the interim ; and although I doubt not but the secretary, Mr Short, will be empowered, yet until he is, the other 
matter will be delayed. 
</p><p>
You seem surprised, that our minister here does not mention 
me. in his letters ; but cui bono ? He knows that we correspond together. You suppose that he has introduced me to the 
Corps Diplomatique. In this you are mistaken. I hinted that 
matter to him shortly after my arrival. He told me they were 
not worth my acquaintance. I did not press the matter, and I 
am persuaded he assigned his real reason. I have since thought 
that it might have been as well otherwise. But on this chapter of acquaintance I have experienced, I believe, the usual 
fate. I have a set which I have made myself, and these are 
not, you will easily conceive, among the worst company of 
Paris, As to the ministerial dinners, I have not been at them. 
It has never been proposed to me. The ministers, you know ? 
give no invitations themselves, and we are bashful. By the 
bye, I some time since went and asked a dinner of the Count 
de Montmorin, who very kindly assured me at parting, that I 
must in his house consider myself at home ; and this, you know, 
from him is not an unmeaning compliment. I find that you are 
a favorite of the whole family. I am tant de bete that I have not 
since profited by these kind assurances. But what can one do ? 
Versailles is the most triste sejour on earth. And though I am 
tempted by the strong passion of curiosity to go thither, and 
attend the debates of the Etats-Generaux, I have not yet prevailed on myself to do it. I believe no man ever made less use 
of strong recommendations to ministerial people. Probably I 
am wrong, but I cannot help it. I go soon to England, and on 
my return I will endeavor to profit more of circumstances. 
</p><p>
I have attentively noticed what you say respecting the per 
sons, who have been arrested with you for their libels. Had 
any conversation arisen on the subject in my presence, I should 
have given the due explanation ; but people here are too much 
occupied with their own affairs to think of anything else. I 
am happy to find, that the attempts to overturn the existing ad 
ministration chez vous have proved abortive ; because there 
are many chances against your meeting with such good friends 
in a new set, as you have in the old. There are great intrigues 
against the administration here, but hitherto without effect. Be 
fore I enter, however, into the detail of occurrences here, I will, 
in reply to one of your questions, inform you, that I have steadily combatted the violence and excess of those persons, who, 
either inspired with an enthusiastic love of freedom, or prompted by sinister designs, are disposed to drive everything to extremity. Our American example has done them good ; but 
like all novelties, liberty runs away with their discretion, if they 
have any. They want an American Constitution, with the exception of a King instead of a President, without reflecting, 
that they have not American citizens to support that constitution. 
Mankind see distant things in a false point of light, and judge 
more or less favorably than they ought ; this is an old observation ; another, perhaps as old, but which all are not in the position to feel, is^ that we try everything by the standard of pre 
conceived notions ; so that there is an impossibility almost of 
knowing by description a distant people or country. Whoever, therefore, desires to apply, in the practical science of government, those rules and forms which prevail and succeed in a 
foreign country, must fall into the same pedantry with our young 
scholars, just fresh from the university, who would fain bring 
everything to the Roman standard. 
</p><p>
Different constitutions of government are necessary to the 
different societies on the face of this planet. Their difference 
of position is, in itself, a powerful cause, as also their manners 
their habits. The scientific tailor, who should cut after Grecian 
or Chinese models, would not have many customers, either in 
London or Paris ; and those who look to America for their 
political forms are not unlike those tailors in the island of Laputa, who, as Gulliver tells us, always take measure with a 
quadrant. He tells us, indeed, what we should naturally 
expect from such a process, that the people are seldom 
fitted. 
</p><p>
And now for occurrences here, after a digression which is 
not of the shortest. The King, who long ago declared for the 
people, has since been wavering. He is an honest man, and 
wishes really to do good; but he has neither genius nor education to show the way toward that good which he desires. In 
the contest between the representatives of the people, and of 
the nobles, he has, by those about him, been induced to give 
support to the latter ; but he came forward too late, and not in 
the proper manner. The result is, that he has retreated, and 
the nobles have been obliged to give way. In fact, this country has undergone a great change unobservedly. The Noblesse, 
who at this day possess neither the force, the wealth, nor the 
talents of the nation, have rather opposed pride than argument 
to their assailants. Hugging the dear privileges of centuries 
long elapsed, they have clamored about the court, while their 
adversaries have possessed themselves fully of the public confidence everywhere. Knowing and feeling the force of that 
situation, they have advanced with a boldness, which to those 
unacquainted with all the facts, has looked like temerity. But 
this hardihood has been imposing. 
</p><p>
Those who are at the head of the opposition to them are not 
possessed of talents or of virtue. The chief has not even 
courage, without which, you know, that in revolutions, there is 
nothing. The French troops, as far as it can be ascertained, 
would not serve against their countrymen; and the foreign 
troops are not sufficiently numerous to make any serious impression. The people of this city are going, (by that invisible instinct which produces in every animal the conduct peculiar to his situation,) in the same road, which marked the au 
rora of American opposition Three months ago the sight of 
a soldier excited awe. Now they speak of attacking whole 
regiments, and in effect there are not unfrequently some scuffles with the foreign troops. This opinion, which is everything becomes daily fortified. 
</p><p>
While I write, I consider the sovereignty of this country as being effectually lodged in the hands of theJlssemblee Nationale, for you will observe, that this name is assumed instead of 
Etats-Generaux, which is tantamount to an American legislature resolving itself into a convention. They mean immediately to form a constitution, and I have no doubt that they 
will obtain the King's consent. The partisans of the ancient 
establishments have contrived to have a very large body of 
troops assembled in this neighborhood, but if I conjecture 
rightly those troops will soon be dispersed. The National 
Assembly have already marked their disapprobation ; but the 
matter will not stop here, and sooner or later the King must 
send them away. Indeed, I am induced to believe that this 
measure will cause the kingdom to be cleared of foreign troops, 
for not being able to rely on the French regiments, they have 
selected principally the foreigners. The probable object of 
those who are at the bottom of the business, is, to surprise some 
order from his Majesty's fears, which are now continually excited, so that he is constantly the sport of apprehensions. 
</p><p>
But they have a more difficult and dangerous business, than 
they are at all aware of. The Assembly have determined) 
that all taxes shall cease when they separate, except such as 
they may continue or impose. This provides for as long a 
term of existence as they may choose to take, and if dispersed, France will certainly refuse to pay. An army will never 
break a general combination to that effect, so that, either sooner or later, they must submit, and every -show of authority 
now will weaken it without producing any other effect. 
</p><p>
Such, then, is the state of this country, in which I think 
the crisis is past without having been perceived ; and now a free constitution will be the certain result. If they have the 
good sense to give the nobles, as such, some share in the national authority, that constitution will probably endure; bat 
otherwise, it will degenerate into a pure monarchy, or become 
a vast republic, a democracy. Can that last? I think not. 
I am sure not; unless the whole people are changed. In any 
event, however, of the business, it bids fair to change the political face of Europe. But whither am I going ? I am, &c.
