I've "come down," in the language of the monte dealers, but not in their sense of the expression, with the dust.
</p><p>
I have only made a transit from the mountain snows of the Sierra to the sunny Vale of the Sacramento, unharmed by the desperado or the treacherous savage, and I once more move in the throng of civilized man--a washed, combed and shaven hombre. I see many changes in matters and things which have occurred during my last sojourn in the mountains, but presuming that your other
correspondents will keep you sufficiently advised of them, I will speak now of mountain life.

I was as near the Gold Lake as any one probably ever was, and although I saw its blue and ice-cold water, I did not see its golden pebbles. The country, however, is highly auriferous in its appearance, and I do not doubt that another season will make rich developments. It is a high, broken range of stupendous hills and deep gulches, where the labor of gaining access is only equaled by the toil of digging gold--where the sun is seen in the ravines scarcely before nine or ten o'clock in the morning, and disappears behind the snowy peaks at four o'clock in the afternoon. By the indications on the trees, the snow falls to the depth of forty feet--perhaps deeper; yet, in this sterile and gloomy region, hundreds of hardy men are preparing to pass the winter, which lasts from November to the 1st of July. To do this, comfortable log cabins are built, and supplies of provisions are packed up on mules, and for the sake of being on the ground before the crowd can get up from the Valley in the spring, they are contented to be buried in the snow, where even the grizzly bear cannot subsist, depending upon their own resources to while away the gloomy hours of their long winter. The experience of the last season has developed many things which will be highly useful to future operations, but I shall speak more particularly of this in some subsequent communication. When you hear of new placers being found, of new diggings discovered, you need not be surprised. These things are of almost daily occurrence, not only regions just explored, but on ground which had been passed over and over by the hardy gold hunter. It has been pretty well tested that the beds of streams are not, as a general thing, the place to look for large deposits. In my explorations of last winter, I did not pass the granite range, but this summer I was far beyond it and saw a geological combination of strata which I do not recollect being noticed by any author. In the Gold Lake Mountains I observed strata of quartz and slate combined in such a manner as to form a single rock. They were so closely blended that one seemed to pass into the other without any line to mark the change, and like the delicate shading of a fine picture, you could not tell where either began. Sometimes on breaking a piece of slate, the fracture showed you a quartz combination, and often the fractured quartz presented the shadowing of slate. I saved and brought down a few beautiful specimens. But here, as elsewhere, the earth was of a reddish brown cast, and the gold proving by its spherical form that it had not been washed far from its original place of deposit.

During my stay at Gold Lake, I visited an extinct volcano The mass of matter which had been thrown out was quartz (at least it is called so), apparently mixed with some substance which rendered
it as hard as flint and by the action of fire presented many fantastical forms--in some instances translucent--sometimes with the crystals perfectly formed, at others partially destroyed. I preserved a few fine specimens. There was no lava, and some of the peculiar volcanic debris which I have often observed in the Rocky Mountains and on the hills west of the Sierra Nevada, in the Oregon Range. Outcrops of slate appeared at and near the base; and along the river bank, directly at the foot of the mountain, one of the richest deposits was found which I have known, one man taking out $1,500 in a single pan full. I do not, however, give this as a specimen of the richness of the placer, for this was about all that was found in that spot. Since the general failure of dams, experiments have been made by sinking shafts in the hills and ravines, and this, at the depth of from ten to twenty feet, has been attended with success in many instances. It is necessary to go to the bedrock, which is done with great labor often. These latter experiments have been made in the mountains immediately bordering the Valley, from six to fifteen miles distant. It seems as if gold loses its value with miners. Some--indeed many who are successful--save their earnings; yet multitudes, after months of toil and privation, first in hunting a location through rain and snow or in the broiling sun, and then in the labor of digging, when they begin to reap the reward of their perseverance, squander it away as if its very possession burned their fingers.

When I first went to Independence, there were companies who every day took out from one hundred and fifty to two hundred dollars. This continued for three weeks, when the equinoctial storm came on with rain and snow. Fearing they would be caught by the deep snow which falls so high up, they became panic-stricken and fled from the diggings. When they left, many had not money to pay small bills due for provisions. The reason was simply that they had gambled it away, and on reaching the Valley I saw some of these very men at work for their board, and some at a nominal price of six dollars a day. Wherever good placers are found the gambler is sure to follow; and another fashion is fast coming into use, which will be fully so when that philanthropic importation arrives from France Well, somebody will be benefited by the improvidence of miners.
