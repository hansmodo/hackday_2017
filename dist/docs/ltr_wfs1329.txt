HEADQUARTES OF THE ARMY,

DEL Rio, FIFTY MILES FROM <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a>, April 19, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1847">1847</a> 
<p></p>
SIR : 
<p></p>
The plan of attack, sketched in General Orders No. 
Ill, herewith, was finely executed by this gallant army 
before two o clock p. M., yesterday. We are quite embarrassed with the results of victory prisoners of war, 
heavy ordnance, field batteries, small arms, and accoutrements. About 3,000jiien laid down their arms, 
with the usual proportion of field and company officers, 
besides five generals, several of them of great distinction Pinson/Jan-ero, La Yega, Noriega, and Obando. 
A sixth general, Yasquez, was killed in defending the 
battery (tower) in the rear of the line of defence, the 
capture of which gave us those glorious results. 
<p></p>
Our loss, though comparatively small in numbers, 
has been serious. Brigadier-General SM 
mander jo&gt;ctivity, zeal,^^ i. not 
dead 3 mortally wounded. He is some five miles from 
me at the moment. The field of operations covered 
many miles, broken by mountains and deep chasms, 
and I have not a report as yet from any division or 
brigade. Twiggs's division^ followed by Shields s (now 
Colonel Baker s) brigade, are now at or near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a>, 
and Worth's division is in route thither ; all pursuing, 
with good results, as I learn, that part of the Mexican 
army 1 perhaps six or seven thousand men that fled 
before our right had carried the tower, and gained the 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a> road. Pillow's brigade alone is near me at 
this depot of wounded, sick, and prisoners, and I have 
time only to give from him the names of First Lieutenant F. B. Nelson, and Second Lieutenant C. G. 
Gill, both of the 2d Tennessee Foot (Haskell s regiment), among the killed ; and in the brigade, one hundred and six of all ranks killed or wounded. Among 
the latter, the gallant Brigadier-General himself has a 
smart wound in the arm, but not disabled, and Major 
E. Farqueson, 2d Tennessee ; Captain H. F. Murray, 
Second Lieutenant G. T. Sutherland, First Lieutenant 
W. P. Hale (Adjutant), all of the same regiment, 
severely, and First Lieutenant "W. Yearwood, mortally 
wounded. And I know, from personal observation on 
the ground, that First Lieutenant Ewell, of the Bines, 
if not now dead, was mortally wounded in entering, 
sword in hand, the intrenchments around the captured 
tower. Second Lieutenant Derby, Topographical Engineers, I also saw, at the same place, severely wounded, and Captain Patten, 2d United States Infantry, 
lost his right hand. Major Sumner, 2d United States 
Dragoons, was slightly wounded the day before, and 
Captain Johnston, Topographical Engineers (now 
Lieutenant-Colonel of infantry), was very severely 
wounded, some days earlier, while reconnoitring. I 
must not omit to add that Captain Mason and Second 
Lieutenant Davis, both of the Rifles, were among the 
very severely wounded in storming the same tower. 
I estimate our total loss in killed and wounded may be 
about two hundred and fifty, and that of the enemy 
three hundred and fifty. In the pursuit toward <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a> (twenty-five miles hence), I learn we have added 
much to the enemy's loss in prisoners, killed, and 
wounded. In fact, I suppose his retreating army to 
be nearly disorganized ; and hence my haste to follow, 
in an hour or two, to profit by events. 
<p></p>
In this hurried and imperfect report I must not 
omit to say that Brigadier-General Twiggs, in passing 
the mountain range beyond Cerro Gordo, crowned with 
the tower, detached from his division, as I suggested 
the day before, a strong force to carry that height, 
which commanded the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a> road at the foot, and 
could not fail, if carried, to cut off the whole or any 
part of the enemy's forces from a retreat in any direction. A portion of the 1st Artillery, under the often 
distinguished Brevet Colonel Childs, the 3d Infantry, 
under Captain Alexander, the 7th Infantry, under 
Lieutenant-Colonel Plympton, and the Bifles, under 
Major Loring, all under the temporary command of 
Colonel Harney, 2d Dragoons, during the confinement 
to his bed of Brevet Brigadier-General P. F. Smith, 
composed that detachment. The style of execution, 
which I had the pleasure to witness, was most brilliant 
and decisive. The brigade ascended the long and 
difficult slope of Cerro Gordo, without shelter, and 
under the tremendous fire of artillery and musketry, 
with the utmost steadiness, reached the breastworks, 
drove the enemy from them, planted the colors of the 
1st Artillery, 3d and 7th Infantry the enemy's flag 
still flying and after some minutes of sharp firing, 
finished the conquest with the bayonet. 
<p></p>
It is a most pleasing duty to say that the highest 
praise is due to Harney, Childs, Plympton, Loring, 
Alexander, their gallant officers and men, for this brilliant service, independent of the great results which 
soon followed 
<p></p>
Worth's division of regulars coming up at this time, 
he detached Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel C. F. Smith, 
with his light battalion, to support the assault, but not 
in time. The general, reaching the tower a few minutes 
before me, and observing a white flag displayed from 
the nearest portion of the enemy toward the batteries 
below, sent out Colonels Harney and Childs to hold a 
parley. The surrender followed in an hour or two. 
<p></p>
Major-General Patterson left a sickbed to share in 
the dangers and fatigues of the day ; and after the surrender went forward to command the advanced forces 
toward <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a>. 
<p></p>
Brigadier-General Pillow and his brigade twice assaulted with great daring the enemy's line of batteries 
on our left; and, though without success, they contributed much to distract and dismay their immediate 
opponents. 
<p></p>
President <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=als" rel="adversary">Santa Anna</>, with Generals Canalize and 
Ampudia, and some six or eight thousand men, escaped 
toward <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a> just before Cerro Gordo was carried, 
and before Twiggs's division reached the national road 
above. 
<p></p>
I have determined to parole the prisoners officers 
and men as I have not the means of feeding them 
here beyond to-day, and cannot afford to detach a 
heavy body of horse and foot, with wagons, to accompany them to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a>. Our baggage train, though 
increasing, is not yet half large enough to give an as 
sured progress to this army. Besides, a greater number of prisoners would probably escape from the escort 
in the long and deep sandy road without subsistence 
ten to one than we shall find again out of the same 
body of men in the ranks opposed to us. Not one of 
the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a> prisoners is believed to have been in the 
lines of Cerro Gordo. Some six of the officers, highest 
in rank, refuse to give their paroles, except to go to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a>, and thence, perhaps, to the United States. 
<p></p>
The small arms and their accoutrements, being of 
no value to our army here or at home, I have ordered 
them to be destroyed ; for we have not the means of 
transporting them. I am also somewhat embarrassed 
with the pieces of artillery all bronze which 
we have captured. It would take a brigade and half 
the mules of this army to transport them fifty miles. 
A field battery I shall take for service with the army ; 
but the heavy metal must be collected and left here for 
the present. We have our own siege-train and the 
proper carriages with us. 
<p></p>
Being much occupied with the prisoners and all the 
details of a forward movement, besides looking to the 
supplies which are to follow from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a>, I have 
time to add no more intending to be at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Jalapa" rel="city">Jalapa</a> early 
to-morrow. We shall not probably again meet with 
serious opposition this side of Perote certainly not, 
unless delayed by the want of the means of transportation. 
<p></p>
I have the honor to remain, sir, with high respect, 
your most obedient servant, 
<p></p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wfs" rel="me">WINFIELD SCOTT</a>. 
<p></p>
P. S. I invite attention to the accompanying letter 
to President <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=als" rel="adversary">Santa Anna</>, taken in his carriage yesterday ; also to his proclamation, issued on hearing that 
we had captured <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=vera cruz" rel="city">VERA CRUZ</a>, etc., in which he says : 
"If the enemy advance one step more, the national 
independence will be buried in the abyss of the past." 
<p></p>
We have taken that step. 
<p></p>
W. S. 
<p></p>
I make a second postscript, to say there is some 
hope, I am happy to learn, that General Shields may 
survive his wounds. 
<p></p>
One of the principal motives for paroling the prisoners of war is to diminish the resistance of other garri 
sons in our march.
