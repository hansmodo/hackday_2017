My Dear Brother : I had to go to North Carolina on a 
wedding tour at Christmas time, and as soon as I got 
back I went to a plantation, not very far off, to spend 
the New Year. I am pretty well acquainted with all 
the rich people round about, and have from them enough 
invitations for the balance of the winter. It is a great 
relief occasionally to slip off from our monotonous drill 
and duty to ramble among the green and noble live oaks 
the most magnificent evergreen in our forest. Then 
again, the planters have plenty to eat and drink, and can, 
without seeming inconvenience, entertain any number of 
straggling acquaintances. When we expect any assemblage large enough to dance, we take along four or five 
musicians from our band, which makes us doubly welcome during the Christmas holidays. The people here 
were not a little alarmed about war, for it would at once 
crush their prosperous rice and cotton trade the only 
articles of trade here. Moreover, the English, in case of 
war, would doubtless do all they could to make the 
slaves rise and would supply them with the necessary 
arms and ammunition to make them really formidable. I have never seen the least sign of disaffection 
on the part of the negroes, and have seen them in the 
cotton field and rice ditches, met them hunting at all 
hours of day and on the road at night, without anything 
but " How d'ye, Massa ? Please give me some bac." 
However, it is easy, no doubt, to make them believe 
they can own the fields and houses they now see, and to 
excite them to resort to means that would even astonish 
their provokers ; but I have heard but one or two who in 
conversation would admit even such danger in case of 
war ; but all admit that the price of negroes would so 
fall as inevitably to destroy such as would be compelled 
to sell such property, such as estates to be divided 
among children, etc. There would be no difficulty in 
taking Charleston our fort is weak and has only about 
100 men it is not ditched or strengthened in such a 
way as to defy an assault. A new fort is being built in 
the channel which, when done, will be very strong, but 
its walls are as yet barely out of water. The Charlestonians have such confidence in Mr. Calhoun, who is decidedly opposed to war, that since his arrival they have 
no apprehension. All here think that such resolutions 
as Mr. Hannigan introduced in the Senate, and such 
speeches as were made by Allen and Cass will cause 
immediate war for which no preparations are in progress, 
or even contemplated. If war takes place, I shall do all 
I can to better my future and rank, but if it slides by, as 
other rumors have, I must remain contented with my 
present commission. . . .

Your affectionate brother,
